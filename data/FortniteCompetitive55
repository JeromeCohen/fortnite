Whether you're at the dead center of the explosion or if you're at the very edge of the explosion radius doesn't matter whatsoever; you take the exact same amount of damage. 

e.g. [scuffed rocket diagram](https://i.imgur.com/4IeBltd.jpg) and [scuffed grenade diagram](https://i.imgur.com/aFsW2Qx.png)

But then why did they never invite him back to play in a non-pubstomp format? He won the biggest single prize in competitive so far and then...? Look, if he had come back and got rekt by Vivid etc that would be fine as the format of the tournament is totally different. We all know that the format of the tournament he won was bad—so much RNG, whoever runs into the most bad players wins. But never inviting him back is innocent just allowing a load of rumor and suspicion to grow and fester. He deserved to be invited back to play against the top scrimmers, just so we can see how good he really is.

I'm playing with 800 dpi and 0.06 in game sens, I've been slowely lowering my sensivity to that point, till I finaly ensured that lowering it anymore won't improve my aim already.  


And here is a problem - whith that pretty low sens I can only build fast in 90 degrees, if I try to turn for a 180 degrees it takes for me some efforts and I can't do it in a one moment (still can do that pretty fast). And 360 degrees turn will take for me like 3 seconds or so.  


And letely I was watching some streamers who play with a same DPI and sens as me (and some of them had even lower) and they can make a 360 degrees turn in a one moment like if their sensivity is like 30+ or so. They only way I see them doing it is switching sensivity in a midle of the fight when they need to build.

Sprint delay bug also sometimes causes jump fatigue even at first jump wich will affect building and buildfights drastically.

I'm pretty good at building, it's definitely my best skill in fortnite. Since I started playing this game I completely focused on building and practiced it A LOT in playground until my building was perfected. My aiming though, meh. I decided to create a new fortnite acc where I only drop tilted, so I wouldn't worry about my stats plummeting and I could get better at close range fights. I can honestly say, since starting this acc, I have never felt like such a shit player. I feel like I have gotten worse as a player because I get so fucking tilted. It's like you miss one shotgun shot in any engagement, or get a bad shot, you die. It's made me realize that I am not consistent hitting my shots, and it makes me angry as hell if I am not lying. Usually, with how I play, I feel pretty confident in my abilities, but landing tilted in solos for the first time has completely shattered my confidence. The pros make it look so easy clearing out tilted, but I am only able to do that like once out of every 10 games. Most of the time, I either die right away, or I get 1-2 kills then die. What's the point of this post you might ask? I don't know to be honest. I am just letting out my frustration. I know that close-range combat without being able to build fight is my weakest point, and I have to work on this skill if I want to get better. But damn, I'm not even enjoying the game because I feel like I am terrible when I drop in these populated places on the map. Has anyone else done something similiar?

Sounds very selfish and dumb but sometimes I hope my mate dies so I can turn the shit up, Im normally a very teamworking player who doesnt care about any ""loot/kill steal"" shit so it's very untypical to ""hope"" these things. It doesnt always happen, but a lot of times I get in those zones in these situations. How can I translate this in pub matches? Im not playing bad in pubs but I dont perform as good as I can, I dont know why. Does anbody else have this strange behavior?",FortniteCompetitive

As someone who has played games like smash bros and league of legends (and even call of duty) where learning and using exploits is a somewhat significant part of being a skilled player, I personally think they should stay.  It’s not like things like fast farming and animation canceling are hard to do and they’re accessible to everyone.  Personally I think it adds another layer of expertise to the game, and even though it may not have been intended, it’s not inherently harmful to the game.

Long story short I think exploits like fast farming and canceling animations by sprinting should stay in the game, what are you guys’ thoughts?",FortniteCompetitive

Generally speaking, when you can instantly kill someone in a competitive video game without using much skill and there not being a whole lot of counter play (yes I know you can build etc. But its hard to defend you're whole body) it's not a healthy mechanic.

To me it seems like the sensitivity starts off a bit slower when you first move until it hits peak velocity, whereas before whenever you moved your joystick the turn speed would be the same throughout the action. Because of this, I've had to increase my X sensitivity from a 8 to a 9, and my Y sensitivity from a 7 to a 9 as well. These changes made my controls feel similar to what they were before, although not exactly the same. I have no idea what someone who used to play on 10/10 is supposed to do.

My question is, I know that many people dislike aim acceleration, but is it inherently bad? Or does it just seem bad to us because we aren't used to it yet? What are the advantages and disadvantages of it?

Either way however, I don't think that these major changes should be made without giving us the option to keep the older settings.

I am also by no means anywhere close to being a pro or whatever I just know I’m a bit above average and not a bot. I’m not bragging I’m just attempting to have credibility. 

Back in solid gold, I did incredibly better than Normal solos or squads. I played a lot of solo squads and all that and I did better in solid gold solo squads than normal solos.

In solid gold, a lot of the rng is eliminated, though not all of it. Everyone was on a more even playing field as far as loot goes and also you had to do a lot less looting which offered higher kill potential games. Besides the heavy shotgun everyone had the same loot basically. And occasionally you would have your games with 3 handcannons or pistols but tbh a good player can put in some work with that stuff. 

I usually die to rng. Whether it be getting 4 grey pistols and the enemy getting a purple rpg and a heavy at fatal fields, or getting bloomed while tapfiring, hitting one shot in the entire mag, only to have the bot I was shooting at turn around and hit two headshots with a tommy gun 100m away which no FSA (I had no shield bc the game never gives it to me). 

Both were real events that I’m sure have happened to everyone. But just bc it happens to everyone doesn’t mean it’s fine. 

The point I’m trying to get at is if I get good rng, I win games. If I don’t, I lose.  How do I minimize the amount of rng I encounter?

And obviously there’s a lot of stuff I do wrong/ games where I cost myself and not rng, but I’d say I get bloomed then beamed a lot more than i potato my shotty shots.

The fire rate of SMGs and their overall accuracy overrules the point of carrying an AR, the fire rate will make up for any of the shots that missed when compared to an AR, and their accuracy is already very high.

Disclaimer: Before you comment about the Scoped AR and Thermal AR being perfectly fine weapons, nothing I say will relate to them, as I also agree that they are currently well balanced.

What I would change:

-  Change the automatic rifles to be 15% more accurate.
-  Change the burst rifles to be 25% more accurate.
-  Increase fire rate of automatic rifles to 6 bullets per second from 5.5.
-  Increase fire rate of burst rifles to 2 instead of 1.75 (or from 12 to 15 whichever fire rate you know of)
**Reasoning**: The Drum Gun has a fire rate of 9, meanwhile the SCAR has a fire rate of 5.5. That's nearly a 60% faster shooting speed than the SCAR, while also having a 50 bullet magazine when in comparison to the SCAR which is only 30 bullets. Relating to burst rifles, they are underused and not favored when in comparison to an an Automatic Rifle, which is already not favored over an SMG (Drum Gun most of the time).",FortniteCompetitive

One which is saying that clingers, c4, miniguns and other anti-turtling weapons are necessary as they are the only thing that can fight back against people turtling. The other is saying that they hate all these weapons and they're annoying.

In my opinion, the issue isn't how you can counter turtling, it's turtling itself. The turbo building buff made turtling incredibly overpowered and allowed players who aren't that good to just hold left click on their wall whilst turtled. As we've seen, there's no skillful way to counter turtling, only annoying methods like clingers and miniguns which require 2 IQ.

While we don't have specific details about how it will work there has been plenty of speculation nonetheless. It seems like most people on this sub feel that the Port-a-Rift will be OP, however I disagree with this sentiment. I am making the assumption that the new item will take up an item slot similar to the Port-a-Fort, if it ends up as a new trap item then that would be a completely different story. 

I compare the Port-a-Rift to a Launch Pad. Using current in-game rifts as a comparison point we know that the rifts give you additional height on your launch, they can be used from cover, and they disappear shortly after being used. While these are all major positives few people would argue that these qualities make the current in-game rifts OP. Also, the benefit of carrying this item would be hurt by the fact that you lose an item slot. Currently there is not much wiggle room in terms of load out since it is pretty much required to carry 1 spray weapon, 1 shotgun, heals, and splodes. The Port-a-Rift will see fierce competition for the fifth and final spot.

In casual play I see the item being used mainly as a fun way to move around the map, and as a last resort mechanic for disengaging. I know a lot of people in this sub don't like to hear that second part. As competitive and high skilled players we enjoy playing aggressive and eliminating as many players as possible. It will be frustrating getting a player weak and then hearing him rift away. However, disengaging from fights is a part of the game whether or not we like it. After all Battle Royale's are about survival. 

In competitive play the Port-a-Rifts will be used mainly as a way of getting good position. However, once again this is no different from the Launch Pads or Rifts we have currently. I will argue again that these items are not OP and are in fact a good thing. I personally enjoy watching a team aggressively launch for high-ground at a crucial moment in late game. The one area that I saw people complaining about Port-a-Rifts being too strong (aside from disengaging) was in a heal-off game. This is really the one situation where a Launch Pad wouldn't be just as useful as a Port-a-Rift. With that being said if we really think about it, how beneficial will rifting to high-ground be in a heal-off situation? There will undoubtedly be another player holding the high-ground so all you are doing is hurting that player's and your own chances of winning, because you will have to fight that player (he will probably laser you as you are landing too). Also, consider if multiple players were to Port-a-Rift they would actually be helping the player without a Port-a-Rift as they are all forced to engage. Not to mention that we shouldn't put much stock into how items affect heal-offs anyway since it is clear that Epic wants to move away from this type of ending (to my knowledge there hasn't been any heal-offs in the Summer Skirmish due to the kill incentives). 

**TLDR**: Assuming the Port-a-Rift takes up an item slot, the pro's of the item will be evened out by the opportunity cost of taking the item over something else. Thus the item will be relatively on par with Launch Pads and not OP.

However I feel as if the Drum Gun shouldn't be a part of the game. We have tangible options for a spray play style especially in terms of destroying structures (mini gun, LMG), so I feel as if this game shouldn't have what's essentially an AR (which half the people would choose Drum Gun over AR already) with a high clip and a faster fire rate than an AR. For close combat, we already have the shotguns which even I think they're fine the way they are now; the smg's in which Epic did a great job nerfing them to a good state, and then the differing types of pistols as well, more so the dual pistols for CRC. Drum gun in my opinion shouldn't be a part of this game because it's everything from destroying structures, to mid range combat with just a little more bloom than AR's, and then CRC with only a little less fire rate than smg's but bigger clip.

I've also really been enjoying pro scrims, to me they are far more entertaining than pubstomps.

In my opinion the worst thing about pro play isn't camping or spamming, it's farming. Because of the nature of Fortnite and the way pros play it, fights, especially in the lategame, are largely determined by how many mats each side has. Because of this, the players spend the entire early game and often a chunk of the midgame hitting everything around them with their pickaxe. It's boring for the players and for the viewers.

The problem is how low material drop rates are in normal modes. Because of how important they are, pros are always going to get as many materials as they can. Low drop rates just means more time spent farming, not a big amount less in play overall.

Personally, I think boosting mat drop rates to how they are in 50v50 would be good (I think it's around 175% of the normal rate). Players can get mats more quickly, reducing the initial farming time withour making mats too easy to get. If Epic wants building to not be as strong, there are other things they can do that wouldn't make players use half the  game to farm.

This increase would greatly decrease the amount of time spent farming in pro matches and scrims, while not having a too major impact on normal games.",FortniteCompetitive

And at this topic I wanna discuss something about a ping and your competitive experience with different pings in frotnite.  


So, first of all - **ping** is a time that take for a data packets to travel from server to you and from you to server back. That means everyone who play Fortnite has a small delay at what he see happend at server - the higher you ping the higher the delay and it's actually harder to play since all you see on your screen actually happend somwhere in the past.  


For some high action games like any shooter (including Fortnite) ping is very important since every milisecond matters while you in a shootgun fight with somebody.  


Well, we all have a different ping and the ones with a smaller ping would have some unfair advantage over other players, and game developers understood it long time ago, so they created a lag-compensation system (it implemented in CS and Overwatch, for example).  


# What is Lag-Compensation system?

As I've already told, it's kinda unfair that a playr with a lower ping has an advantage, so lag-compensation system calculates a position of every player in moment of time and adapting your shoots for your ping. In a simple words - it means that if you hit a shoot on your screen it will be registered on the server, no matter what.

So even if someone with a much lower ping already killed you on the server's side, but you didn't see it yet due to your higher ping, you can still kill that player on your PC  (or at least do some dmg) and it will be registered at the server - pretty fair system IMO.  


# How does ping works in Fortnite:

Well, as far as I know Fortnite don't have full lag-compensation system, you can find some videos in youtube that actually shows there is some, but I assume lag compensation only works for a players with a REALLY high ping, like 200+ or so, since calculations for a lag-compensation takes lot of server's resources and it's hard to do for all 100 players in game at the same time.  


So what does it mean? It means - since lag-compensation doesn't exists for a players with a decent ping - the one who has smaller ping has a pretty big advantage over others, especially if the ping difference is big.  


Here is my Paint image for example - how the player with 10 ping will perform against a player with a 80 ping:

[Starting point is where both players see each others first time at the server's side.](https://i.redd.it/yb01fxntahh11.png)

# How it affects me in numbers:

Well, I'm from Russia (sorry for my not perfect englando btw), and due to the IP blocks of a few Epics servers by our goverment (long story), I have to play with a VPN on most of the time and while I play with a VPN on my ping goes up to 60-90 (75 on avarage) and when I play without VPN my ping is 30-50 (35 on avarage).

As soon as I've started to play trought VPN I've noticed that I win way less game then before, and actually noticed some other things:

1. Often  dieing early while me and another player shooted at eachother, but my  shoot haven't done any DMG, despite I've seen like 10 red dots on the  enemy right before I died.
2. Also often seeing red dots, but no dmg when I shoot someone and he builds a wall at almost the same time.
3. Seeing hit indicator, but also no dmg when I shoot someone flying in the sky rly fast.  


**Finaly about number:**  
When I play with my 30 ping my winrate about 15%, and when I play trough VPN with 60-90 ping my winrate is about 7%. And I assume it's because I'm the player who mostly relуs on my AIM and less on building and also I love to drop tilted where the fast reaction time is metter a lot.  


**So simply +50 to ping downs my winrate twice.**  


And a last example in numbers - if you still haven't understood it doesn't really matter how high your ping, but what really matters is what the difference between your ping and your opponent's ping. Let's get back to the to players with 10 ping and 80 ping. The player with a 10 ping will see his enemy 70 miliseconds faster and his shoot gonna be registered at the server 70 miliseconds faster too, so it means, the player with 10 ms ping has a 140 ms advantage over the 80 ping players.  


It might seem not that much but it's actually huge since the decent reaction time for a young male is about 200 ms, so simply the guy who has 140 ms advantage due to low ping has almost twice as more time to react for anything that happens in a game and ofc he always gonna shoot first and win more fights due to that idd.  


  
P.S: you can check your reaction time there - [https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime)

It makes ping unnecessarily more of a burden than it needs to be.

This is an issue that has been around since the beginning of the game, when playing on controller the game does not allow you to switch the weapon selection box before the weapon you have to switched to has fully loaded. This means that additional inputs during this buffer period are ignored and you have to wait for the weapon to fully load before it processes the next command.

This makes it so that the game is unplayable on higher pings because you cannot rotate between your inventory efficiently. Say for instance you were in slot 1 and wanted to switch to slot 3, if you press RB RB, the game will only register the first RB and you'll be placed into slot 2, in order to switch to slot 3 you will have to wait for slot 2 to load then press RB again once it has loaded. If you've ever been in a fight and sworn you swapped to another slot but it gave you the previous on, this is was more than likely happened.

The actual process of the weapon switching isn't client side, but the selection box is for KB + M, this is what needs to be implemented for controller so that the selection box switches on immediate input as oppose to waiting for the server to give it the thumbs up that the first weapon has loaded before registering the next.

This is a massive issue because someone like me who plays on EU servers with an average 15 ping cannot play with people on any other server without this problem affecting me and similarly, players from other regions cannot play on my servers without this issue affecting them.

You can try this out for yourself:

For PC: Enter playground mode and disconnect yourself from the game servers by entering flight mode and try to switch around weapons with your KB+M, the selection box will move around perfectly, additionally you can then plug in a controller and try to do it again, you will move one box then it will not accept any other inputs until you reconnect to the server.

For console: Switch your matchmaking region to the highest ping available, enter playground mode and switch your weapons from slot 1 to 3 like you would normally, the server will not register any inputs until the the ammo count for slot 2 has appeared above your health, that's the point of reference for when the server allows you to switch again.

TL;DR: The weapon selection box is server side for controller, creating an unnecessary input delay when switching and inputs during the buffer period are ignored, meaning that you have to wait for a weapon to fully load before switching again. This makes it impossible to play on high ping servers.",FortniteCompetitive

In previous seasons, if you had 200 hp and third partied someone, there was still a risk that you get clapped in the face and die or completely lose your advantage.  These days if I third party with 200 hp, all I have to do is jump straight on someone who is likely low HP and potentially doesn't have his SMG reloaded and I win the fight 95% of the time.  Even if he pumps me for 170 which almost never happens, I still likely win the SMG spam off.

This is a serious problem in my opinion and the only way to fix it is to bring back shotguns as fight equalizers.  That was how they worked until season 5.  When your back was against the wall, you pulled out your pump and did a hail mary.  It was great for the game and needs to come back in order to deal with the rampant third partying.  It's actually less about one pumps and more about the fact that you barely ever hit for 100+ in build fights with headshots anymore.",FortniteCompetitive

The difference between pubs and pro matches is that there is money on the line. Wins actually matter. Every game matters. You cannot play bad and die early one game and just hop into another. I think Epic implemented the spray meta to make the pro scene more interesting. Prior to this, people just turtled with no counter. With the introduction of spray guns they tried to force players to carry them to stop turtling. This isn't the proper solution. The way to stop turtling is to make kills more valuable. While they made playing for kills more worthwhile with the points per kill they didn't help by making a victory royal and 7+ kills multiplier affect the next game. This is what needs to be changed

They need to make the multiplier affect the current game. It also makes it more interesting if someone gets a high kill game AND wins. Really good end game players play for the win, they camp and don't go for kills until the last circle and go for the win. This isn't how it should be played. If you win you get the 3x multiplier on your current game. if you have 1 kill you should get 3 points for that game. EVERY game should matter. The first game you get a win and play passive then you try to pub stomp the next game and not go for the win. Change the multipliers to the current game and I think a lot less players will turtle.

Double shotgun was treated the same way. The obvious solution was to remove it completely from the game when it was young. If you removed double shotty in season 2 people would not complain as much. The game was young and there was less players. The community has grown so much since then. The backlash today is much bigger than before. Remove the double shotguns back then and we wouldn't have had this problem. Instead they tried to slowly nerf them and ruined the game for a lot of people. It became core gameplay. If you wanted to push, double shotgun was super effective until all of the nerfs. They then decided to remove double shotguns when they were in its weakest state, hence the backlash. Shotgun spam was superior yet they decided to remove something that should have been removed a long time ago. Don't get me wrong, I loved double shotgun. But if I was epic and I wanted to stop shotguns from ruling the meta, do it when its young. 

League of Legends does this too, and I feel like it slowly killed the game. They allowed broken champions to be in the game for so long. After suffering for so long they finally decide to nerf the champ to oblivion??? No... just balance it, don't ruin the champion. They then super buff another champion, let it rampage through games for 2 weeks and nerf the champ to where it was prior the buff making them super weak. 

All in all, Epic needs to properly nerf/buff/add/remove things. What happened to LTM's where the players tested things? The first shot accuracy and damage fallout LTM. A lot of people disagreed with this. They didn't implement it until a month or so after it. I disliked the patch but I've grown to like it. First shot accuracy helps a lot but the damage falloff on guns like the deagle and revolver are too much.

By now I can't even count how many times I died when the floor below me got shot out and it did not matter if the player shooting was good or not. If at any time someone starts shooting me from below I know I'm loosing that fight, I try to stick high ground and of course the drum gun gets 2-4 hits through the floor and at some point I just fall down, then either I get sprayed down or shotgunned for 20 damage. Moving around does not help in the slightest, building more doesn't help in the slightest and most importantly jumping down doesn't work at all. Structure damage is so high that low ground players will always have the upper hand and a drum gun will win them so many fights it's unbelievable. 

How do I play this game, should I never build for height and stay either boxed up or hold left click until the person above me dies? Is running 3 drum guns viable?

What was the point of learning how to build, I spent hours on top of hours learning how to take high ground which was always the superior position, now with the shitty peeking it's easier for low ground to hit me then it is for me to hit them. Is this the new playstyle epic mentioned?

Pros are perfectly capable of agreeing to use strict loadouts for scrims/skirmishes/tourneys etc. Obviously there would have to be exceptions made for extreme early game, but after clearing a POI every player should have a shotgun and an AR. So why not agree to use a standard loadout of shotgun/AR/snipe/throwable/heals when playing competitively? Clingers and frags would be up for debate I guess considering they're also splodes, but there would still need to be some kind of counter to turtling.

1. Ninja is one of the OG BR players and while he may not be the best at pro style play, he is definitely one of the most creative/entertaining players in the world.
2. Ninja hasn’t fully committed to pro style play (minimal scrims practice and no consistent partner make this even more difficult) and may never, which is completely fine and his choice.
3. I currently am of the belief that even in pro play/scrims Ninja values the quality of the product he’s putting out (aka not sitting in a 1x1 till circle moves) more than actually winning.

Now to address the theory:

We have seen Ninja scrim/competitively play (including Fortnite Friday) with the following (I understand I may be missing some):

-KR
-Reverse2k
-Tfue
-Cloak
-Hysteria
(Yes I know I’m missing some)

But let’s focus on these individuals: Hysteria, KR, Reverse2k.

Whether it’s right or not, I think most people would rank these three players as inferior to Ninja in terms of skill. In all three cases when Ninja has played with these three, he runs lead/point in terms of call outs, play style, pace and overall strategy etc.

When playing with these three there has been mixed success, but when specifically looking at summer skirmish events, Hysteria, KR, and Reverse2k have out played/ranked higher than Ninja when playing with OTHER partners.

Everyone knows the Ninja has no discipline when it comes to engagements. 1v1 he is one of the best in the world (dating back to the Halo days) but with so much 3P activity coming into play in scrim/pro style, he’s constantly dying early.

We saw this manifest itself the most with Reverse2k (also an extremely aggressive player) where they would push fights and end up taking out the first team and then not being able to survive the second wave of players coming in.

With KR they were absolutely terrible. I’ve always believed KR is so high up in the clouds/slow at processing he can’t handle the speed at which Ninja dissects, analyzes and makes call outs.

The common theme with all three is that Ninja is the unquestioned leader of the team. Pushing teams unnecessarily, getting pinched, making bad rotations, fighting storm are all common themes Ninja-led teams face when in competitive play style.

In cases with Tfue and Cloak he considers them both equals when playing, and thus takes their input allows them to run point.

Specifically with Cloak, while they still died quite early for summer skirmish week 6, they still didn’t push EVERY engagement they could have and played fairly smart.

In scrims with Tfue they actually won a match and placed solidly throughout the night while Tfue was lead.

In both cases with Tfue and Cloak there were times Ninja wanted to push engagements, and the Faze guys held him back like a rabid dog chomping at the bit. And because Ninja respects them and actually listens to them, he pulled back and followed.

Bottom line is that unless Ninja changes fundamentally in pro style play (plays even 10-15% less agro), he will never succeed as much as if he lets his partner run point. When he DOES learn this he will be a scary pro player. His innovative play style mixed with patience is a dangerous combination.

TLDR: when Ninja takes lead in pro style duos he is too agro and gets 3P’d far too often. Playing support role/less aggressive in the future will be only way he succeeds at a high level in pro style.",FortniteCompetitive

Of course some people are better at building than others, but as someone who has also played Fortnite on PC, your building speed as a console players seems greatly capped.

For aiming, aim assist greatly reduced any aiming skill gap on console.

Obviously intangibles like game sense and staying calm under pressure separate good from great players, but I'm looking for more specific gameplay mechanics that separate the top tier console players, such as Kamolrf, from other players.

To be clear, I'm a console player, so this post is not meant to be negative towards console at all. I'm frustrated because I feel that I'm an above average player but I can't break into the tier above me of ""really good"" or even great. I am doing everything, practicing in playground and analyzing all of my fights.

Also, I'm not asking about hardware suggestions, I have a four paddle controller which I don't use because it's very uncomfortable and throws off my aim, and also have a Strike pack which I don't use, for the same reason. ",FortniteCompetitive

It's really hard to explain all this, be sure to ask questions :).

Some reasons why they are usable (in this case)  for the engame of scrims:

· 1: In the one of the **last zones**, you can actually cuck people very bad if they are **under you**. If you place the they **cant place their own stair.** That means **you dictate** the fight. It also makes it harder for them to move around properly 

If you place these things: They **can’t edit their floors and pyramids** above them easily, and they’ll have a hard time      going up, while you have an easier time to go down.

·  2: When going to the **next zone**and **people are below you**trying to go to the next zone, **place** these **below you**. Imagine how annoying it will be for the opponent (This is not exactly  the same usage as 1)

·  3:  People **turtle up** a lot if days. If you are above them, you will catch ‘em of guard or trap them. \[3\]

· 4: If you want an **extra layer of protection**, place these like I showed you in use 3. \[4\]

[1: \(enemies persepective\) In this case especially, it would be really annoying for Aviar to move around properly.](https://i.redd.it/wb78y458g5h11.png)

[2: \(enemies perspective\) The people above Liquid Chap should have placed them.](https://i.redd.it/ecn90ek9g5h11.png)

[3: What Ross could have done here in addition to throwing a clinger, is placing the cone structure. He could have trapped the enemy. \(Not the best example\)](https://i.redd.it/0lps1vlcg5h11.png)

[4: Here Cloakzy was making a skybase. In the video he actually went down to add another layer. The best solution for Cloakzy would be to place the cone structure under him, instead of taking the risk to go down.](https://i.redd.it/y2308xfeg5h11.png)

\*Enemy perspective means: You are looking at the perspective of the person against whom the pyramids should have been used)

\-----

**TL;DR**

Pyramids are useful in scrim endgames to Cause chaos and protect from below.

I advise you to watch a scrim and imagine these things being placed down in any of these scenarios. Watch how annoying that would be for the opponent.

I've been using the dualies a lot lately because I'm kinda sick of nerfed shotguns and they're actually kinda nuts.

I've been running them in either my shotty or SMG slot and they've felt like a tac shotgun with more range, more structure damage, and more realistic burst potential (headshots without having to barrel stuff the enemy).  Even with bloom, they feel like they have at least the effective range of a heavy shotgun, if not more, and they do full damage to a surprisingly decent range.  They don't have the draw damage of the pump, and they shoot bursts surprisingly fast for a gun that does 82 bodyshot damage per burst.

No, they're not that accurate.  They're not replacing your AR.  That said, at the range where you're really relying on bloom luck, shotguns are pretty useless and your enemy will be relying on bloom luck with an AR or SMG anyways.

What do you guys think?  A lot of people tried them when they came out, got screwed by bloom, and dropped them, but that was a very different meta with better shotguns and SMGs.  If you haven't used them lately, maybe you should think about giving them a try.",FortniteCompetitive

Ive kind of suspected this for a while but Lupo's comments suggest it may be true: Epic doesnt want what we want guys. Zeke is performing exactly how he was told to as was lupo. Epic is telling them, keep it casual, act like its a stream. Be entertaining at all costs even if it means paying zero attention to the match. Cause we wont give you any tools to help cast it.

They want a casual, immature, goofy stream. They invite content creators, hire streamers, and get their own immature with an obnoxious laugh over the top video editor to set the tone for that goal. And theyve succeeded. They are reporting to the board of directors (65 year non gamers who represent investors, also non gamers) the amazing viewers they are recieving whilst keeping costs to a minimum.

We will never see the improvements we want reddit. Even though we think we are the tournaments target demographic, we are not. Epic wants the casual young base. The ones that cant tell about low production value. The ones that will love the stream cause they laughed. The people that cant tell in game action is being missed because they have a .8kd with no game awareness and thus wouldnt realize anyway.

We can never have the stream the way we want it if its not even epics goal to make it so. Theyre testing ways to get the young ones to watch whilst spending as little money as possible to run it. ",FortniteCompetitive

With how the tournament has been set up the last 2 weeks the first 3-4 games could very well win someone the entire tournament if they completely slayed out and capitalized on the multipliers. 

Part of the reason why I enjoyed FF is because of the H2H bracket set up. How the first 2 games kill count was merged together so if one team went down XX amount of kills there was hype if they made the comeback to win or send it into an overtime game. This format provided the ""championship game"" that SS does not have.

In a game like Counter-Strike this wouldn't be a problem, because it would be absolutely horrible to play with that ping. However, in Fortnite where hit detection works the way it does, it means you are stripped of some of your means of outplaying. I'll give you an example:

&gt;Player X with 200 ping stands behind a wall and is about to peek. I anticipate that and jump the split second Player X does peek, causing his pump bullets to fly under me. I can see it happening, I can record it, go back and literally see his bullets fly under me and yet he headshots me. Because on his screen he probably shot before I jumped. The problem is obvious, not only does his high ping mean that I can't dodge his bullets, I even made it harder for myself to hit him by jumping.

In a game that relies so much on quick reactions, it's unacceptable for it to work like this, prohibiting you from countering your opponents actions. It means you take a lot of unnecessary damage, it means you get shot through your walls, and generally it just makes the game way more inconsistent than it should be. When I try playing on American servers, it feels like a way more consistent experience, I hit more snipes because people don't teleport around as much. That in itself is also ridiculous, there's simply no way I should have a more enjoyable and consistent experience with 100 ping in a shooting game.

The EU servers either need a massive upgrade or more servers need to be put in place in more geographic regions. EU west, EU east, Middle East etc.   
I know this place is mostly US, but I can't be the only one experiencing this.",FortniteCompetitive

Us console players get a choice of 
1- precise aim but a sacrifice to building speed which is everything in this game or 
2- an extremely high sensitivity to maximise building speed but at that point your sacrificing the ability to hit easy shotgun flicks and smg sprays. (i know some people who play 10/10 with ease because they’ve played other games using really high sensitivity and it’s natural for them but there are a lot of people like myself and others that come from games like cod where it’s always been key to play on a lower sensitivity)

Here’s my suggestion: the Zappatron comes back while drum gun dominates and gives an option to charge up and fire a one-body shot that stops the spam. It would require insane skill close range since you have to charge it up, so it wouldn’t be too bad close range, and with the peaking angles, you can’t charge it up behind cover and also know where your enemies are. Hell, it could even do 0 damage to structures. A long charge and long reload would make it balanced. What does the competitive sub think?",FortniteCompetitive

They get a ton of kills they get a few thousand?  Why do I care as a spectator?

Nothing about this felt competitive except that some of the players were very good.  I get more excited watching scrim games than I felt watching this event. I think the reason for that is that the scrim games feel like they have a more structured early mid and late and end game where strategies change as the game progresses instead of just turning into hungry hungry hippo for kills until you die in the mid game.

If you win a game with high kills i would highly advise taking maybe a 15 20 minute break after the game just to relax, cool down and compose yourself. You don't want to head into another game straight away as you'll be playing like you were at the end of your previous game feeling invincible and will likely die early game or at least in my experience i do. As well as this if your having a streak of bad games, take an hour break or something as well. You are just going to get angry at yourself if you keep playing and that will make you play even worse. Take the time to relax, compose yourself and come back stronger. ",FortniteCompetitive

The big difference between these 2 genres is the fact that you only have 1 life in Fortnite, versus instant respawn in Call of Duty.

I would definitely say I am above average in Fortnite, yet I somehow always seem to die to some stupid bs before I win. Assuming I get into the top 8 or so, I am pretty much going to win the game 85% of the time. Yet, my win rate is just about 17% (due to dying earlier or getting third partied in mid-late game)

So I just decided to try something new (for me) - once there were only about 15 or so people left, I build 1x1s near the center of the circles and waited. Obviously I would engage in people once I had a clear shot and the confidence to know that I would win. I did this twice in a row, and won twice in a row (7 kills and 10 kills).

Is this really the key to win a match? (I have just over 800 wins, like 270 in solo and the rest mainly in squads, but I would say under 50 of them come from when I 1x1 camp)",FortniteCompetitive

We're back with the Sixth week of Epic's EU Summer Skirmish! Today's post will be a little different, as there will not be a player list atm, and we will only have live match discussions, but no post match discussions since there will be 2 tournaments back to back!

&amp;nbsp;

---

The events span across four days, two events per day, with the first on August 17. Each will be a part of Epic Games’ ongoing Fortnite Summer Skirmish Series, including 49 duo teams from EU or NA competing for $260,000 in their respective regions.

The first event in the four-event series starts Friday, August 17 with the European tournament at 9 AM PT followed by the North American tournament at 2 PM PT. You can catch all of the action on twitch.tv/TwitchRivals or watch some of the streamers’ perspectives on their own channels:

&amp;nbsp;

#Format: KING PIN

Each game, teams will be ranked on based on the points earned in a single game. Eliminations earn players points that will be scored at the end of each match. Earning a Victory Royale will provide a team with a 3x Elimination bonus in the next match.
 

- Elimination: +1 Point
- Victory Royale: 3x Elimination Bonus Next Match
- 7+ Eliminations: 2x Elimination Bonus Next Match

I can go into their esports and I instantly know which team is losing or winning even if I have never played their game. Tune in on a fortnite tournament mid game and it’s a cluster fuck 

For a company like epic who makes something ridiculous like 200-400million a month, you’re telling me they can’t even allocate a small percentage of that towards improving their viewing experience? 


I get it, battle royal is hard to spectate but the analysts desk is complete shit there is no news about standings there is no communication between the crew or the host it seems. And we’re forced to watch people who play on shit resolution like stretched, not everyone wants to watch some guy play fortnite pixilated *no one cares about the benefits of stretched in no way should you force that upon your viewers*



This week, we had multiple teams not being able to join the games and what did epic do? *fuck it let’s run it without those people* seriously? Where the hell is your tech support? 


20 player lobbied btw since half the invited teams couldn’t join.

If your whole viewing system is literally just switching between streamers, no one is going to take you seriously as an esports. 

Half these streamers look like their playing on a gameboy advanced with their shit resolution so every time they’re on the main screen you just start hoping they die so they can switch to a different screen

If you need to be reminded of past weeks format here is it:

- **Week 1 Duo**
    - 10 Games, first team to get 2 victory royale wins the entire thing.
- **WeeK 2: Solo**
  -  PubStomping, very similar to FridayFortnite on Pub servers
- **Week 3 Duo**
  - Victory royale 4 Pts, 5+ Kills 2 pts, first team to get to 13 points win.
- **Week 4 Solo**
   - Victory royale 2 pts, 2nd/3rd 1pt, 4+ Kills 1 pt, most Elim 1 pt.
- **Week 5: Duo**	
 - 1 Kill 1 pt, Victory royale = 3x Point for the next match, 7+ Kills = 2x pts next match.



Now here is the list of PROS favorite format of the past weeks.

Faze Tfue | [Week 1](https://clips.twitch.tv/SpicySassySlothBlargNaut) or 3 was his favorite but he doens't mind week 5.

Here's why that is wrong. (Some things about teams might not be correct because Epic doesn't release the full scoring)

1. **Consistency means doing well in almost every game, not 2 games**

We say this last week, where Ghost (I think DMO and Bizzle) got an insane amount of points in the last game because of the multiplayer. The last two games basically put them into second, and the other 8 games did not matter. They could've had 0 kills for 8 games, won the 9th game with no kills, and popped off for 13+ kills the last game and made top 3 (If the top 3 was around 40 points which I think it was). That team does better than a team that alternates between 7 and 0 kills every game. That is not rewarding consistency. 

2. **The multiplier only affecting the next game increases RNG heavily**

This seems pretty obvious to be honest. If you win a game and then die off spawn, you get absolutely 0 reward for winning the game. The same goes for getting 7 kills, you get no reward if you die off spawn or before you can get kills. It doesn't matter if a duo does consistently well (~5 kills, top 3) in every other game if they don't pop off with their multiplayer if they get one. This happened to Chap and 72, where they would get 7 kills in multiple games but not get lucky with their multiplier.

3. **The goal of a BR game is to win, but this is not reflected in this format**

I guess this might be the most opinion-related point. (Not opinion) The goal of BR is to be the last man, duo, or squad standing. (Opinion kinda) This should be reflected in the competitive scene. The 3x multiplier is not a good incentive to win, because it is heavily RNG to even take advantage of the multiplier. This was kinda shown in the game where Poach and Vivid won (when every other player died to storm because every team was focusing on kills and not surviving.",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve been eating well, working out again, focusing on improving every single day, but my WR has fallen from 30% to 17%.

I identified sleep has been the single biggest issue. With all that’s going on, it would have best served me to take every other day off. I went on to play on an alt account to try and get past this slump I’ve been experiencing. I kept blaming the meta, but I was also potatoing easy shots, and building sloppy. Two nights in a row I got a full 8 hours, and I’ve been absolutely slaying. The slump just ceased to exist.

I get on almost daily if not at least 3-5 times a week for 3+ hours to try and get better and it’s so hard. There are games where I get an amazing start with 5+ kills coming out of my landing spot. I’m hitting shotgun shots for at least 50+ damage (tac user because fuck the pump delay) and usually melt most players I see and I can get a win at least once in a batch of games played. However, there are other games where I land somewhere to open a chest, some fucking Randy ass player decides to do the same and grabs it as he lands and destroys me.

Other times I get games where I get melted within a second by literally anything, Harry Potter myself, hit 23 dmg shots, and die to explodes spam. These things tilt me so much that I can’t even enjoy the game anymore and lose the desire to get better. It feels like building doesn’t even really compliment skill as it used to anymore, as getting the high ground doesn’t mean shit when your entire structure just gets blown to the ground by C4/rockets. I grind solos and 50 vs 50 but when I die to BS I immediately get so tilted and cannot continue to play without stressing myself out and eventually deteriorating my mental state to the point where playing only makes me feel worse. If anyone had any advice to give to combat tilting I would be happy to hear it.

TL;DR - No matter how much I play I feel like I will never be as good as I want to be and lose the motivation to even try. Advice to combat this feeling is welcome.",FortniteCompetitive

INTRODUCTION

Keybinding in Fortnite is very important. Why you may ask? Because there is so freaking much to bind, 5 build binds, 6 weapon binds, crouch, edit, reload, etc... It's really important that you use the easily accessible keys like Q, F and E for important things. So I'm going to start this guide after the introduction with what imo, can be different for you but this is what most people think, are the most easily accessible keys and the most important binds. Then I'll show my keybindings and why they're the best for me (trust me, I've tried alot). I do this because you guys can pretty much replicate my thought process when searching for your own perfect ones. After that I'm going to show you guys what some pros use, the pros and cons of it and why they use it. I do this so you guys can get an idea of why some keybinding are good and why some are bad.

IMPORTANT BINDS AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE KEYS

For me the most accessible keys are: Q C E F R SHIFT CTRL and all of my mouse buttons. This may be different for you, example, Z, for me it doesn't feel good to press it but for you maybe it is. Also one really important thing is your thumb is able to easily press C V and B, for me that's not the case unfortunately because my desk is too high and my chair is too low. Having the ability to move your thumb of the spacebar and press C V and B is a really great privilege.

The most important actions are: wall, floor, ramp, edit, shotgun, smg and crouch. Imo the wall, ramp, and edit actions are slightly more important. Also have you noticed pickup/interact is not in here? Yeah that's right, E is imo a waste for pickup and should be assigned to something more important. For example I use it for editing.

The actions that are a bit less important than those above are: pyramid, traps, reload, pickup/interact, AR and sniped/explosives. Those will be assigned to a little less easily accessible keys, like V and G for me. If you have keys left from the above, use them for these. I also did this for some actions

The rest of the actions are irrelevant

MY KEYBINDS AND WHY

So now that you guys have an idea of what keys are easy to press and what important actions are let's look at mine and why I chose them. So here they are:

Wall: Q

Floor: F

Ramp: Mouse button

Pyramid: C

Trap: T

Edit: E

Pickaxe: 1

Shotgun: Mouse button

SMG: SHIFT

AR: TAB

Sniper/explosives: ALT

Healing items: 3

Pickup: G

Reload: R

Crouch: CTRL

OK so wall, floor and ramp, pretty obvious. All 3 are really important Q F and that mouse button are really easy to reach. All 3 are on different fingers which I like, you can also have all on the same finger and I'll talk about that later when going over pros' keybinds. I can easily double ramp floor wall with these. Pyramid, C, I can swap between F and C fast if I want to secure my 'bridge' on top of somebody. Other than that really easy key to reach of course. Traps, T, traps are niche and T for me is easy to reach as long as it's not in an intense fight and I need to move at the same time.

Moving on to edit, E, editing is very very important so I chose one of the 2 easiest keys reachable for this. 

Now to the gun binds, pickaxe, 1, pretty irrelevant. Shotgun, mouse button, I used to have shift but I felt like my pinky was slow so I changed it to a mouse button. SMG, SHIFT, I always use this after my shotgun so I prepare my pinky for it, pretty much instaswitch after you've shot your shotgun. AR, TAB, TAB is relatively easy to reach for me, pretty straightforward why I chose this one for AR. Sniper/explosives, ALT, the same explanation as for AR goes here. Heals, 3, irrelevant.

Pickup, G, this is a weird one for most people, G is fairly easy to reach and just perfect for pickup imo, no explanation required.

Reload, R, just the standard, I didn't need to use R for anything else so I just left it at R.

Crouch, CTRL, CTRL is better than C for crouching imo, crouching often goes paired with jumping and having your thumb on spacebar and your index finger on C just feels uncomfortable for me.

That's pretty much my keybinds explained, now on to the pros' ones.

I got 5 hits off and he placed a wall. All I had to do is put stairs and jump on him and kill him with my pump. This kind of gameplay is so BORING. Thats what literally happens everygame, all of my kills are easy to achieve and I need to put in 0 work to get a kill. I dont lose games anymore unless I get 3rd partied or sniped to the head from behind, and while I do think im a fairly skilled player it shouldnt be this easy. The skill gap is nonexistant becouse even though players are trying to get better at the game they are not only aiming on getting better at building which was the case in seasons 1-4. The idea in fights was ""get highround. Get and angle and shoot. If the opponent boxes himself after a good pump shot (which used to usually do 120+ dmg btw) your goal is to claim one of his walls or his roof and make an edit play.  Now if a new player who understands the basics lasers you thanks to bloom and you box yourself theyre not trying to claim your wall, theyre trying to *destroy all of them* until you die. I know this isnt as bad as it used to be due to the nerfs to p90 and other spammy guns and the buffs to walls. (after the nerfs to walls...). But regardless I have gotten bored with it. Just today I saw a build battle in the distance and this got me thinking back to those days where almost every battle was considered a build battle.
Nowdays the better builder doesnt win 99% of the time, the better builder wins 70% of the time and it makes me feel sick and bored.
I wonder if there's anyone else back from season 1-2 who is feeling the same.

I'm decent and feel confident in most of my fights, but I too often find myself taking 50-100 damage a fight instead of getting clean kills. I know patience is the name of the game but I sometimes struggle with this, due to the risk of getting third-partied. 

Another typical situation for me is to find a bad player who doesn't build, and I peak over my ramp two or three times to shotgun them, but each time I peak, they tag me, usually for not much damage, but it adds up. I get the kill but took way more damage than necessary against a bad player. And that happens when I am trying to time my shots in between theirs.

I'm on console so instant edits to open a window, take a shot and close it aren't very feasible. One thing that has helped me though, taken from KamoLRF (although any good to great player does this) is being one level above your opponent (even if they are on the ground) and editing the flat to drop down on them from behind or when they are unsuspecting. See the clip below of me using that for reference.

What other tips feasible to apply on console do you guys have?

He plays fortnite and is decent but he hasn't followed competitive fortnite at all.  This thread is my attempt at that.  I'm not a great writer and the longer my posts get the more likely they are to devolve into me spewing out random thoughts. Sorry in advance.


**Early game:**

Early game is the foundation you build the rest of your game on, it's also pretty boring because most of it is prep work with maybe 1 or 2 fights. Materials are far more important here than in regular games because as the game progresses into late game it becomes impossible to collect any meaningful amount of mats except through killing players which is an unreliable source at best.

Goals in early game:
* Maximum materials 
* 200HP and reserve meds
* Explosives of your choice (clingers and c4 are most desirable currently)
* Gun loadout of your choice (a shotgun and a spraying gun at a minimum)

Achieving all of these goals every game won't be possible but the degree of success will be heavily impacted by drop location.

Your drop location is the first choice you make in a game and it will impact the rest of your game.  Drop location metas will constantly shift and evolve so I won't go too into specific detail.  When choosing a drop location you can look back at your early game goals and choose a location that will allow you to at least somewhat meet those goals.  Keep in mind the more appealing a location is to you the more appealing it is to other people which increases your risk.  Drop locations are all about managing the risk of other players dropping in the same location versus the rewards that location offers.

Here are some things to keep in mind while choosing where to drop:
* How much total loot (chests and ground) is available here?
* How many materials and of what types can I get here? Is there a nearby rotation for materials such as a rock pit?
* Are there mushrooms either in my area or that I can easily rotate to?
* Are there rifts or atks?

Every player will weigh these differently. Is it worth it to sacrifice an area with a lot of chests for guaranteed shield from mushrooms?  Can you skimp on the metal to be near rifts making your rotations better/safer?  I'll leave this to you to decide.


**Mid game:**

Mid game is where macro positioning and rotations start to matter a lot.  All of your rotations should be made with both the current circle and potential future circles in mind while avoiding material waste.

Player density has increased dramatically and you'll have to decide which fights to take and how hard to commit to them.  If your early game didn't go well and you find yourself lacking in any of your early game goals you may need to take a risk and be aggressive with other players in the mid game.  Alternatively if you had the ideal early game there is little reason to fight other players because the risk of fighting them isn't worth the reward of their loot since much of it will be left on the ground.  Engaging in a build battle during this part of the game is extremely dangerous as there are opportunists everywhere looking to 3rd party (attack players that are fighting other players).  When a player gets aggressive if you don't need their loot it's often safer to just say no and take the lowground for now.

**Late game:** 

Positioning is very important and should be thought about constantly.  The player density is even higher and it's very dangerous to be out in the open.  Most of the gameplay during this portion of the game will be players trying to improve their position relative to the new circle.  Sometimes this means sneaking around using other players as a distraction, sometimes you have to build your way into the zone using fully built 1x1s along the ground (snaking or tunneling) and sometimes it's something in between using some mats to cover a specific angle.  You'll often see people wait until the storm is forcing them to move because everyone is hoping someone else will make the first move and serve as a distraction for them to make theirs.

**End game:**

The smaller the circles get the more players will fight for higher ground.  Players will be building far more during this time and the entire playing area will be flooded with build.  Low and midground is now a soup of many players builds and players from highground may try to connect their build to midground if their build isn't well supported.  Never camp somewhere if you aren't surrounded by your own walls or you may get edited on or find yourself trapped when someone throws a clinger at you. Look for opportunities to use high impact items like launch pads and explosives to take higher ground and secure kills, especially during forced rotations from the circles movement.  Depending on where the circle moves high ground can range from a luxury to a necessity if the circle moves to a mountain.

The ultimate goal of players on the highground is to cover the entire final circle with floors/pyramids(for increased stability) making it nearly impossible to contest without a lot of explosives.  From that position they can either attempt to out heal the players below them (if they feel they have sufficient healing) or bombard the low ground with explosives/spray.  In non solos you'll see them do both with 1 teammate trying to heal while the others goes to disrupt the enemies healing.  This meta isn't super established yet,  I've seen many teams/players try many different things with varying degrees of success.  I'm interested to see what people come up with as the meta game progresses. 

I hope this helps some people that are just getting into the competitive side of fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

As much as I enjoy seeing the back and forth to earn the upper hand for the heal-off, I'm sure we would all like to see the actual final moment be more exciting in every high level game.

Lets brainstorm some solutions.

- **Idea: Moving circles.** Instead of fully closing in, the final circle starts moving further and further away, or just continuously moves in random directions.
**Problem:** Could become a battle of ""who has most mats."" No hard time limit on match.

- **Idea: Slow death.** The final circle closes instantly, but does reduced damage. This would give players more room/time to find and fight each other, making a straight up out-heal harder. **Problem:** Players might launch pad away to do a hard out-heal play.

- **Idea: Confined slow death.** Instead of closing the circle, players just start taking damage over time. Storm damage remains high. **Problem:** Might still be too cramped for a good fight.",FortniteCompetitive

(Inspired by glaz from rainbow)

The way the smoke grenades worked were essentially the same as normal grenades. It would bounce around before ""exploding"". If epic changed it so that it would ""explode"" on impact peopld would definitely start using the smoke grenades.

 The way I see a lot of fights is a bunch of building and then one person spamming your walls with a lmg/Minigun/Tommy gun (how many spammy weapons do we need geez) Sometimes 'just build lol' can't counter it but throw a few smokes down, heal up and suprise the enemy.

(Also for people who suggest use stink grenades, they are rarer than smoke grenades were and are difficult to use for defensive purposes )

Now, the Drum Gun excels in nearly every niche which renders the lower class SMGs useless in comparison. 

The problems:

1.) The skill gap is very low thanks to the spam meta. Having the Drum Gun do 25+ damage and having a 50 round clip makes it an ideal weapon to have.... especially in close quarters.

2.) Less incentive to pick up the Silenced and Normal SMGs. The Drum Gun is definitely owning the meta right now and lowers the diversity of the meta. Having this is so boring.

3.) The P-90 is basically a weaker version of the Drum Gun. Having both large capacity weapons seems redundant to me.

The double barrel, while an extremely situational weapon, allows players to do very high damage without having to aim for a head shot, or even a solid body shot because of the high spread.  While a pump user would have to aim for the head and deal around 100 damage, a double barrel user can simply look at their opponent and fire off two rounds to kill them. While I don't thinks these additions significantly hurt the game, I worry that epic constantly feels the need to add new weapons to the game. I struggle to understand what niche the heavy sniper fills that isn't filled by the bolt. It is simply an easier to use bolt.

498,rs3isforkids,1534351550,97jutp,135,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/97jutp/pump_shotgun_upcoming_change/,262,Pump Shotgun upcoming change,"I am aware that the pump shotgun will get a slight ""buff"" in the upcoming week, but let me just post a list of all the shotgun nerfs in the past couple of months.

1. Shotgun Pull out Delay-I think the original delay came in late Season 3. Pump shotgun take longer to pull out in attempt to nerf double pumping, I think all shotguns have a slight pullout time, but none as long as the pump.
2. Shotgun structure damage nerf- I think it was 50% less damage to structures. Pumps do around 40 damage to structures, basically nothing. 
3. Shotgun Ammo nerf on spawn- Shotguns spawn with 4 floor ammo instead of 5. Example in S5 - you spawn on a double barrel and you only have 6 shots total. 2 in the gun and 4 for backup. That's literally nothing. 
4. Shotgun Damage nerf and Headshot Multiplier reduced. - Pump goes from 90/95 to 80/85, also instead of a 2.5 multiplier, it goes down to a 2.0 multiplier..I honestly feel a middle ground of 2.25 would be better, keep the numbers the same. (Example- Blue pump would do 191 max which is still less than a gold heavy at 192.5) 
5. Another Hidden nerf was the shotgun headshot radius. The neck used to count for headshots, but that is no longer the case. Hitting a clean 170 with a blue pump is near impossible unless you ADS and put the barrel in their throat. If I ever hit triple digits with a pump, I am ecstatic. 
6. With introduction to Season 5- The Shotgun Swap Timer. This is the worst of them all. I understand double pump probably shouldn't be in the game, but if I am running a single pump and I switch to building, back to my pump, I do not believe there should be a spin wheel delay, where I just have my crosshair lined up on them, but am unable to shoot my gun. It feels terrible. These clunky Mechanics take away from the Fortnite experience that pulled me so close to the game to begin with. The mechanics used to feel fluid and rewarding, but now at times just a clunky shitfest. A big problem I am having for the past couple of months is my pump not firing, because I have had months of muscle memory switching after shooting. I now hesitate when shooting my pump, because I am fearful it will not shoot if I swap to an SMG too quickly. 

My purpose of this post is to highlight the fact that most if not all of the community is extremely happy for the decrease in pullout delay, however it is sad that this should not have even been a thing to begin with starting in season 5 with the shotgun timers. This shotgun pullout mechanic SHOULD HAVE NEVER EXISTED once double pump was extinct. If this is their logic, then all SMGS or fast firing weapons should have a swap delay, deterring people from not having to reload their 40 or 50 round mags and switch to another freshly reloaded SMG to continue their onslaught. This is the first shotgun ""buff"" (which hasn't even happened yet) in MONTHS. 

I respect Epic and their quick responses to the community and trying to cater to every type of player (example: the recent building health changes were fantastic), but I'm just saying that the fact that this small change is so wildly celebrated, is sad. It should have been gone a long time ago. ",FortniteCompetitive

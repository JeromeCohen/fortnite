Obviously, this means that the rifts/portals appearing around the map lead to our world (I don't mean they ACTUALLY lead to our world, but you get what I mean), which also means that, obviously, Tomato Head and everything else that has been sucked into the rift are all scattered around our world.

What does this mean? Is Epic teasing at us at possibly a Fortnite theme park or even a possible Fortnite movie (would make sense because of all the movie stuff in season 4), or maybe this means that stuff from our world will start appearing in the Fortnite world. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Not anymore.

During the past two months for some reason Epic has been nerfing Star Power with a series of unnecessary changes that absolutely nobody asked for.

First they nerfed the wide smiles that our characters did during the dance so now we can barely tell any difference from the current smile and the default expression of our character. After that Epic changed the rainbow animation so it dissapears abruptly instead of fading gradually. 

And in the last patch they changed the emote again. Before this change the male skins closed their eyes when the rainbow showed up, and the female skins kept their eyes open. But now both close their eyes and with that Epic effectively nerfed the variety of Star Power.

So you turn on Bots, which are matched to your skill level, and you play with them instead, to practice build fighting and what not. This is how it can be implemented by EPIC

1.To turn on the option you have to go to settings and turn on “PG Bots”

2. When you turn it on for the first time, it will ask for you to take a skill test. You have the option to proceed or cancel(cancelling disables Bots). Basically, you are put in a PG match with bots. There are 5 types of bots - Noob, Semi-decent, Decent, Good, Expert. You and the bot are spawned in with the same weapons and max mats. You then have to build battle each bot three times each, starting from Noob going up.Bots that you beat 3/3 times will be considered too easy, and you will move onto the next level of skill(e.g you beat Noob up to decent and for all of them you win 3/3, but against good you only win two, Good will be the skill level of your  bots)

3. You then can choose the amount of bots that will be in your game while in the lobby, and you get given markers of where they must land. Basically, they are out in groups of ten (but aren’t on a team), so if you have 20 in your match, you can put one marker in pleasant and one in tilted, 10 will go to pleasant, 10 will go to tilted. They behave like normal players and won’t all land at the same house, if one bot is already at a house, another bot will either try get in from the bottom or go to another house.

And that’s my suggestion! Hope you guys like it, I wouldn’t mind seeing this being implemented in PG myself; comment any of your thoughts or suggestions if you have any. And thanks for reading this whole thing lol.",FortNiteBR

I love the Deagle, but I think it’s really not that strong as it initially was, so I hope they could remove its damage drop-off mechanic.

Since there are many weapons in the game rn, I assume the Deagle’s pick rate is really low.

As many people have stated before, this system is flawed. The XP gain in games is set up so especially in solos, which many people play, it’s very hard to gain XP and camping actually gains more xp than getting kills and dying top 20. 

This system favors grinding the crap out of fortnite rather than skill. The maxed out variants of these skins should be hard to get, but epic is doing it the wrong way. Instead of levels for skin variants, there should be challenges that are very, well, challenging. Not some generic search 7 chests or get SMG kills, but challenges like:
 
Win 5 (or 10) games over the course of a season.

Get 1000 kills over the course of a season.

Deal ___ damage over the course of a season

Maybe more idk

Challenges like these would let skilled players get the maxed skin, so seeing a maxed out skin would be something to fear. ",FortNiteBR

So we are just 5 days away from the start of season 5. There is a lot of information to cover but I would like to just start out with saying that there is no information as of 10:05AM EST on July 7th confirmed by Epic. So lets just start with the most obvious thing.

**""The Crack""**
The massive crack in the sky just showed up without warning to be honest on the day of the rocket launch. There has been a lot of speculation of what this crack could be but I think at this point with all the files being found lately that this is a tear in the space-time continuum. We can assume this by things disappearing and the crack having left a mini portal or sorts as the aftermath, which means it can take things. And with yesterdays event of the anchor appearing that means things can come through it as well. 

**The Durr Burger**
So yesterday there was a random photographer on twitter that was in a desert and he found the Durr Burger. The Durr Burger had just disappeared the day before. This is already very suspicious as there is no reason for a Durr Burger to be in the middle of the desert with a reasoning or context. But to add something to the mix, there is also a police car that is very similar to the car in the game. [See Post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8wpsyt/fun_fact_i_looked_up_the_plate_from_the_fortnite/) by u/whicketywack. There is also what is presumably a security guard who is passing as an agent handing out a card with a phone number on it, [see post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8wpyb3/a_secret_agent_handed_a_card_to_someone_who_went/) by u/killrmeemstr. When the phone number is called the same noise is played as when you ADS at the crack in the sky in game. So this is most definitely the work of Epic, why else would there be someone guarding it, whilst handing out cards that have a number in which plays the crack noise? But what does this all mean. Well there are a few possibility's in my opinion. This could hint at a new desert map, or this could hint at Greasy being turned into a Egypt type POI, if the History theme theory is correct. Which leads into the next point,

**Data-Mined Items.**
I'm gonna try to keep this area relativity short as they as data mined and not confirmed as to which mode they are from (correct me if I am wrong). But there has been files found of things that relate to a [Wild West POI] (https://prnt.sc/k3nlxz) [another picture of Wild West possiblity] (https://prnt.sc/k3nmfl), a [Greece POI (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8woswe/new_greece_pol_found_in_files/), and a theory of my own, and yes I'm sure I'm not the only one to notice this, but I think that there will also be a Viking theme/POI. The reason I think this is because the Anchor that was put into the game yesterday is a lot like how Vikings used to make their anchors, some wood and stone slapped together with some rope. There are also some pictures of which I cannot find (link if you have them and credit will be given) of some more Wild West Pictures and a picture of a dead dinosaur. So this leaves us with the possibility of a History theme, with a Wild West, Greece Gods, Vikings, and Egyptian and possible Dinosaurs contents. Again none of this is confirmed and is just all of the thoughts of the Fortnite Community thrown together and some actual semi-evidence that could prove it. 

If anyone here has pictures to support this post, something you believe or have found that isn't included, feel free to let me know and you will be credited! 

**TL;DR** - (The actual post has ALOT more detail) The crack is a tear in the space-time continuum and we know this by the way that it takes things and can put things into the world like the anchor. The Durr Burger was found a day after it disappeared in the desert with an agent guarding it who gives out a phone number that plays the noise when you ADS at the crack. This could possibly mean a desert map. Leaks of items point towards a Greece, Egpytian, Viking, Dinosaurs, and Wild West theme, IE: History themed. This is what the battle pass and season is assumed to be themed as, History. Once again if you want the supporting evidence and more information in general read the whole post :)",FortNiteBR

160 wins - Stage 5


160 wins honestly isn’t that hard to achieve in 70 days, and it would show the player being skilled instead of having a lot of time to spare. Whether or not LTM wins count towards this would be up the Epic, I personally would want only Solo, Duo, and Squad wins to count.",FortNiteBR

There's a possible gifting feauture that's probably going to come in Season 5. Here's m thoughts on how I think it's gonna work. There is a option in the settings to receive gifts. Nobody would refuse a free item so that correlates to gifting cosemtics from the item shop. Unfortunately that's not the case, you have a 'Recieve Gifting Option' I can see why people would turn this off if they added a trading feauture called gifting. It would be annoying to get trade/gift requests so that's why it is there. Ok now going on to my hypothetical.

If they added trading where you can Trade/Gift I am looking for some skins and emotes.  Floss and Sparkle Specialist. I am willing to Trade/Gift some skins for that. 

Either way there's a gifting feauture coming. People are speculating that you can gift items in the shop, while some are saying that you can Trade items in your inventory.

I LOVE the challenge that comes with it - it's probably the most challenging game I've ever played but I end up HATING myself everytime I play anything but the LTM modes.

Recently I thought I was getting better in 50/50 - getting 5 kills a game and generally building well, knowing my preferred loadout, having sensitivity settings, and key binds all OK - so I decide to test myself and jump into solos. (I've probably played 400 solo matches now).

I can get the bots kills but as soon as I run into a remotely decent played I usually get f***ed in a close range battle or by a sniper who seems to have the hand of a god, and it tilts me so hard that I end up thinking 'why the hell am I even playing this game?!', yet here I am waking up the next morning with Fortnite on my mind and wanting to get better, wanting to ask questions to the community because I know this game is one of the biggest challenges in gaming right now.

What's going so wrong with my game? Should I be more conservative and not push so many people? 

I watch great streamers like Tfue, Krafty, KingRichard, Dakotaz and always feel like I learn a lot but when it comes to application in the 'real world' I just die and die and die and my KD never changes. 

How do I chill with the game and not get so angry - keep my cool and get some kills? As a newcomer to the BR type of game and a newcomer to online shooters I'd absolutely LOVE some moral and informative support.",FortNiteBR

Ninja is by far one of the best players in the world currently and constantly shows that in his streams but he kinda believes that hes the best player, He does know other people who don't stream are better than him and hes not salty for that but because he streams he thinks every good player or even player who manage to kill him in early game are considered stream snipers to him. Take for example 'Changa'. He was playing duos with his friend \*ON STREAM\* and got into a game but his duos partner disconnected in the lobby to restart, Changa dropped Tilted to make it a quick rush game and ended by knocking and killing Ninja and his duo partner, Ninja immediately assumed stream sniper because he was solo and had ""perfect mats"" to Ninja's words. He then went on the say ""I'm gonna get this guys name dude"" all in frustration that he died.  


I feel bad for all the players that are genuinely top tier level with Ninja and can properly give him a hard challenge and end up getting punished or even banned in some cases just because Ninja assumes they're stream sniping. This doesn't mean people don't stream snipe him, he gets sniped a lot but the people to are just playing cop the punishments. And as far as I'm concerned Ninja never even apologized to Changa. Ninja is top tier and we all know that but I think people have just caught up to him and now present real challenge and competition in his games and he needs to know that instead of having his Season 1-2 mindset that he was the best player.  


I'm sorry if I offend anyone that are fans of his but this is my honest opinion on Ninja, I still love the guy and hes a amazing dude for what he does but I think hes just changed.",FortNiteBR

I think it would be super interesting if during the bus ride, the players could influence it's path in hopes of steering closer to where the want to land.

Every player who holds their console's equivalent of L2 causes the bus to curve 1 degree to the left. Everyone who holds R2/equivalent pushes 1 degree to the right. Whichever side has more pushing trumps the other. Maybe make a maximum of 45 degrees. Maybe these numbers can be tweaked, I dunno it's just an idea.

Because people would be fighting over left and right, the trajectory affect would be minimal in many games, but games where many people agree, the bus would curve more significantly.

Could be cool.",FortNiteBR

(WHY YOU SHOULD TOO...),"I have decided to create this post after reaching 1000 wins and after my most successful season of Fortnite so far. Due to the horrible skill gap condensing that is becoming more and more evident; I have decided to quite playing Fortnite. Epic has proven that they are a horrible company and only cater their game to the least skilled individuals in the game. I can accept that they are company with a bottom line but they are making obvious mistakes that they know are hurting longevity the game. Every patch has nerfed the only  game mechanics that set good players and less skilled players apart.(building). The recent buff to explosives have finished whatever skill gap that was left (especially C4). A new player with explosives will have a very good chance of killing any player in the lobby regardless of skill. They should change the name to EXPLOSIVESNITE since that is the best late game strategy at the moment. Hide and save up your explosives for the last few kids and your chances of winning are very high, regardless of skill. The nerf to floor mats does not really effect the game but the buff to all the weapons and explosives that counter building make certain fights hopeless, regardless of skill. TSM\_Myth died twice in the Fortine Friday Tournament Final from C4, not because he made a bad play but because a team happened to have a item that is near unstoppable. This was supposed to be battle royal after all which should be, survival of the fittest. The game has turned into almost all RNG which is not fun whether you win or lose. I have decided to quit the game until tomorrow ;) but I hope Epic decides to make changes that will help the game stay long term instead of short term money chase. The games that stick around and stay relevant have huge skill gaps which lead to a successful Competitive scene while keeping the best players happy with the game and the less skilled players something to work towards. (CSGO, LOL, DOTA, Overwatch). Thanks for listening to my rant. Before you try and call me out on skill, feel free to check my stats: Season 4 Solo 37&amp;#37; win ratio, etc. [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/travizcott](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/travizcott)  I don't need a pat on the back, I understand I am just an average player.

Blizzard/Overwatch is already a company which collaborated with them and made awesome stuff for each character. 

Hopefully Epic could do the same. (and *cough cough&amp; probably make more bank).

This game is great and enjoyable, ON LOW PING. Where I live, We don't have any dedicated server for this game, however, I am not here to complain about that. I am here to suggest an option where you can match with players who has the same ping as your or close to it. I think it's not for a player with 30 or 40 Latency to be matched with a player who has over 140 Latency, because the fight is all ready over. Ex. : Building. Whenever I meet a player with low ping and shoot at him, he will build a cube around himself instantly, where if do it, every ramp or wall I build I have to click twice on the mouse because it has a 1 sec delay. I got killed thousand times because of this 1 sec delay. Another Ex. : Fighting. There are many times that the enemy I shot at didn't take any damage, instead, The Hitmark sign appear. This frustrating  because you thought you shot the player and eliminated him, instead of that, you get shotgunned to the face (This happens many times in Shotgun fights / AR from long range).
I don't mean any hate to Epic or game developers by this, I just want to let people know that we have some problems and hopefully this gets solved.

Stop listening to whining children.","I realize at epic that they have to take some of their community’s ideas into the game. One of my ideas is even coming soon! But stop listening to complaints. Key word, COMPLAINTS. Listen to ideas, not complaints. So many wonderful features and weapons have been removed because epic chooses to listen to whining children. For instance, I’ll list just a few... crossbows, guided missiles, skybase mode, close encounters. Four right there, 50 others. The point I make is that some weapons need to be a little overpowered in order to make the game fun. It adds skill to try and avoid them. Guided missile: one coming? Build a quick shelter. It takes literally only 4 walls and maybe a 1*1 roof to avoid it. And as for rocket riding on it you can just shoot them. Not that hard to miss a moving target that can turn very slowly. Crossbow? A weapon with shit damage that has infinite ammo. It’s a shit weapon with slow reload. Not hard to avoid. Build a wall and you are good. Close encounters? It’s an LTM. It’s not going to last forever. Don’t like it? Don’t play it. Learn to shoot properly. Sky bases? Build a stairway or use a jetpack (oh, those were removed too). And why were they removed? Because epic buckled under the pressure of children 30 years younger than the staff and took weapons away that unskilled children can’t deal with. I feel with playground added it would be a perfect opportunity to add some of those old weapons back. Playground is excellent for training and practice. But avoiding these weapons required something that has faded in fortnite recently. SKILL. Gamemodes like close encounters and sky bases required SKILL to win. My point is that younger children are going to have difficulty. That’s ok. Without difficulty there is no real challenge. Also, if you look at the weapons, the only really unique ones are the mini gun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, and grenades. Those are it. Let’s look at comparing new items. Dual pistols? close range burst assaults. Drum gun? A. Little faster less accurate version of regular AR. Stink bomb? Actually, that one stops campers. Thumbs up for that one. But so do rocket launchers. Never mind, stink bombs are a later version of rocket launchers. The weapons and game modes mentioned above were unique and required skill. There are no real stand out weapons. All I’m saying is for epic to stop listening to complaining little kids. Please, for the sake of keeping things interesting.",FortNiteBR

Even if they had done it before (I haven't seen it in the past month but maybe I missed it), shouldn't it be something visible every day to make sure everyone gets the memo? If this information had been more widely available, there probably wouldn't be nearly as many complaints from people who can't get to 80, mostly because they found out late or didn't really understand how much grinding it takes.

Secondly, if a player never Google's the tier 100 challenges, they wouldn't know they would need to be 80 until it's probably too late. Most people don't grind XP, they just play to have fun. Why does it requ information outside the game itself for a normal player to learn that he needs to get his shit together and grind so he doesn't miss the deadline? Seems thoughtless to put something anyone who buys the battle pass behind a time wall they need to Google about beforehand or play the game constantly to obtain.

Thirdly, the fact that they felt the need to announce to players that they need to level up for all the content in their battle pass leads me to believe that they might do something to help all the angry players. It would be good PR but what do I know.",FortNiteBR

He gave us a card with an agent number and phone number in the back. The ""agent"" can be seen at the end of the video and in one of the pictures.[Durr Burger](https://imgur.com/gallery/fm7BTlb)",FortNiteBR

I don't know where or how to start this, I'm just frustrated and annoyed, I recently lost my credit card and some jerk decided to take it for a joy ride and spend over 750 dollars in BestBuy.

After finding out about the absurd transaction I called my credit card company to disable my card and SPECIFICALLY to only charge back the transaction made at BestBuy, I don't know why or how, but i'm assuming my credit card decided to do a charge back on the last 30 day transactions.

A few days later I sign in to Fortnite to play with my girlfriend

(who is also caught on this sticky situation, I bought us both the wingman starter kit which was the transaction that got charged back to Epic Games, and wrongfully banned us)

And we get the message ""fraudulent and/or chargebacks by the issuing bank"" I get confused as of why I would get this message so I call my Credit Card company to see what the confusion was and they happen to do a charge back on the online transactions in past 30 days. I tell them immediately to send the fortnite payments back to Epic Games, and told them that I authorized the payments.

I message Epic about the situation and the updates, but Ive yet to receive and updates or news, and whats making me angry is that I've spent more over 200 dollars on this game just to see myself get banned for an issue with my bank and the lack of communication with Epic Games, I've gave them back their money yet i'm still banned and I'm hearing nothing from them. I feel robbed, I've burned so much money on Epic, and I can't even get a hold of them properly without being messaged by a pointless bot repeating the same messages. Once again I've spent over 200 dollars on this game just to get wrongfully banned, I'm a victim in this situation.

Framerates will be based off of my current rig, a GTX 1070 with core i7 6800 cpu at 1080p, looking across loot lake. Here we go!

Window mode:
Full screen ALWAYS
Importance: not very important, but should always be at full screen
This will just make your life nicer. It looks the best, and plays the best.


Display resolution: set it at your monitors native resolution.
Importance: very important
This should always be set to the highest, and if you need a couple more frames, you are better off slightly adjusting the 3D resolution


3D resolution: set at your monitors native resolution and lower if necessary.
Importance: not very important, but should be set to highest possible
Lower only if you are losing FPS


FPS cap: set to unlimited. Smooths out any stutters you might get when capping.


V-sync. Turn on if you do not want screen tearing (where when you look around, the image that you see gets split in two.). This has a little bit of a performance impact, but not much. If your monitor has G-sync or freesync, turn this option off and turn it on in the control panel of AMD or Nvidia.



Main graphics settings:

View distance: the higher the option, the more you can see around you, but the only thing you will notice turning it up is grass draw distance. Player render distance is not affected by this.

You might as well set it to the highest your computer can take.
Performance importance: not very important. Going from low to epic saw an improvement from 180 FPS to 160 FPS.
Game importance: not very important. If you want the game to look nice, set this to the highest setting.


Shadows: Shadows make the game look way nicer but has a huge impact on performance.
Recommendation: do not set it to medium, it makes the game look awful. Off is great for performance, and epic looks great but kills your FPS. A good balance I found was high, where the FPS was fine, and the game looked great.

Performance importance: very high. Going from off to epic saw an FPS decrease from 170 to 144, but when running around, the framerate will go down even further.
Game importance: very low, but in very select instances your enemy can be around a corner and shadows on might let you know that they are there sooner, but that is very rare.


Anti-Aliasing: This option smooths out sharp edges that you would see in the distance. I would not recommend medium, as I think it looks very ugly. One thing to note: high and epic options look exactly the same.

I would definitely recommend high or epic, and it completely gets rid of all sharp edges and makes the game look great with little performance impact.
Performance impact: very little. Going from off to epic saw a 10 FPS decrease. Turn to off if you need to save performance.
Game impact: none. This is purely how the game looks and gives you no competitive advantage.


Textures: Set this based on the amount of v-ram your GPU has. In my case, the GTX 1070 has 8 gb of ram, so I can set it to epic with little performance impact, but if you have, let’s say 3 gb, you may want to lower it.

Performance impact: little to high, based on amount of v-ram. Going from low to epic saw no decrease of FPS for my GPU, but definitely lower it if you have a weaker GPU
Game Impact: none. This is just to make the game look nicer.


Effects: this one is pretty important. Depending on the settings, it can change the dust behind your feet from running, screen space reflections in bodies of water, the look of the storm whilst in it, and smaller things like fire. You would want to turn this down if you need a big FPS boost.
Low: no reflections, 2D dust from running, not great looking fire and storm effects.
Medium: turns on 3D dust from running.
High: turns on reflections
Epic: makes storm effects better.

Performance impact: fairly important. Went from 180 FPS to 160, but running around will make the FPS go down to further levels with this being the main cause.
Game impact: none, just makes the game look nicer.


Post Processing: makes the game look nicer by letting you use motion blur, ambient occlusion (small shadows that fill small gaps but aren’t real shadows), and lens flairs. Raising this will improve the quality over all of the effects states above.

Performance impact: very little. Saw a 5 FPS decrease, but like with others, moving around will make you see a decrease even further, but very slightly.
Game impact: none, gives you no competitive advantage. Just makes the game look nicer. If anything, it gives you a small disadvantage, with lens flairs blocking your sight sometimes.


Motion blur: only present if post processing is set to medium or higher. Makes the game look nicer with litter performance impact.

Performance impact (medium post processing):  No performance impact.
Game impact: May give you competitive disadvantage because while turning around if you get shot in the back, it will be more difficult to track your enemies, as they will just be indistinct blurs.



Presets:

Performance at low preset: 180 FPS
Medium: 140 FPS 
High: 120 FPS 
Epic: 105 FPS

While moving:

Low: 160 FPS
Medium: 130 FPS
High: 110 FPS
Epic: 90-100 FPS

Why do I hate it so much?

* The crater is too big and destroyed too many sources for materials and chests. It also destroyed my favorite landing spot; Factories.
* Hop Rocks are not fun to fight.
* It's a hassle to get across Dusty Divot, causing it to be incredibly similar to Loot Lake, an already annoying part of the map.
* It ruins surrounding locations like Retail Row and Salty Springs because of these traits.

Hopefully Season 5 will restore the Dusty Depot area and remove this annoying obstacle in the middle of the map.",FortNiteBR

Right, so, as you can tell by the title of this post, FortniteBR is bad. Like; really, really bad. There's a whole slew of reasons for this, as far as I can ascertain from attempting to play it over two seasons now, but it really boils down to a few things, as follows: balance, or lack thereof; building spam; and shotguns.  


Let's start with balance. You see, competitive games in general have a sort of balance between players. One player might have access to one ability but not another and things even out. Fortnite's balance consists of playing the lottery (hint: playing the lottery is a thing you do if you want to lose) and hoping you get a shiny purple or gold gun because thirty seconds into the storm forming everyone else and their quadriplegic dog has a SCAR with which they will mow you down from more than 100m away. ""Now, Ember,"" you might say, ""that's the whole schtick with the game! It's an RNG powered battle royale game and you're supposed to let luck decide!"" Newsflash: Luck is non-existent and most people are just shafted by RNG. My point is that a little bit of RNG is fine and dandy in a game. Hunting for better and better guns is what makes Borderlands pretty fun and entertaining, after all; but the problem with it in Fortnite is the sheer difference between different rarity guns in the same categories. If those differences were reduced or negated in some way, shape, or form, it'd go a good way toward making the game a bit more interesting. Suddenly things wouldn't be decided by who has the gold guns as even a white rarity weapon could prove competitive even in late game.  


Building spam is next on the list. So I get it that FortniteBR is kind of special in the battle royale ""genre"" (coughfarcecough) for the building mechanics. The problem with the building mechanics is that they actually require you to learn another mechanic in addition to shooting to be successful in a game where you still have to win by shooting. The mechanic is a neat idea, but poorly implemented. In battle, it's no longer decided by who has the better aim and tactics, it's decided by who can build a better base in less than a second than their opponent. And if you don't have a rocket launcher to take on a base (thanks to that shitass RNG mentioned earlier), then you're boned. Up Shit Creek without a paddle. The building mechanic absolutely trashes the hell out of any thought of being stealthy and infiltrating because not only does it force you to be loud if you're going to shoot it, but it also forces you to be loud if you're going to build above it to rain death from above. There's no way to get the jump on anyone, so playstyles basically amount to booking it to the circle, building a base the size of a small hotel, and camping for five minutes. I honestly feel that the mechanic should really only be usable for battlefield mobility (climbing mountains and houses). I think that allowing players to build full on bunkers is not a way to add fun to a game ""genre"" (hahaha there it is again) that relies on speed.  


Finally, we get to shotguns. Which, I should say, is not exactly the issue itself but merely a sort of sub-issue within two actual issues. The issues here are the lack of a contender to the shotgun at close range and the fact that close range combat is just so God awful. The first issue of these two related ones is pretty easy to fix: make something else good at short range OR introduce a new weapon that works at short range (like an actually usable melee weapon or something cough cough). Also fix shotguns still. Yeah they've been made consistent (or so they say) but they're still too strong. Anyways, the second of these nested issues is that combat at short ranges is bad.  


How is it bad? Well, take the TTK(Time-To-Kill) of a midrange fight and delete all but like, the first second. Because that's how long close range battles are. Sure you can prolong it by doing some sort of jumpdance with your opponent, but it all literally comes down to who can jump the best direction and get a lucky blast with the shotgun. There's no strategy, there's no skill. There's just hoping your aim assist kicks in as you're spamming the jump command and hoping you get a good hit with the shotgun. This basically means that short range battles may look like they go on for a bit, but they don't really start until one guy gets hit and that still usually means it's over too fast thanks to the utter dominance of luck-based-shotgun-jump-""strats"".  


So basically, this game is a pretty crappy example of a game. There needs to be a lot of changes mechanically to improve it, but the problem there is that Epic Games just wants to shove new guns (most of which are meh) and microtransactions   (and yes I get that people need money) and nonsense ""story"" into the game rather than fix balancing and mechanical issues that have pervaded the game since release.",FortNiteBR

1. Maybe with the addition of all the new ‘utility’ items, chests should have 5 drops instead of 4, or maybe make it a chance? Just because there are less heals in the game as it has been watered down by c4, impulse grenades, port a forts, clingers, stink grenades etc, in the time we’ve received all these items we’ve had the chug jug and mini shields, heals being watered down can make games a lot more frustrating like when you have to run from lucky landing to dusty divot and you’ve got 5 bandages and a single mini but like 9 clingers.

2. Remove rockets, grenade launchers and maybe snipers (but keep snipers in floor loot and maybe up their spawn rate), I understand it’s a BR game and it’s all luck based but it’s infuriating as hell when you get a purple grenade launcher and there’s a full squad below you in the building.

3. Last point, maybe add shotguns to chests (other than heavy shotguns) just as it can be infuriating when you’ve got a white AR or whatever early game but somebody else found a shotgun which is the only weapon capable to one shot (excluding splodes and snipers which are generally more utility weapons and not close  range weapons). 

Probs gonna get hate because ‘it’s a battle royale game it’s luck based’ but these changes just make it a bit more so you can’t just get fully fucked by your luck vs your opponents luck ",FortNiteBR

I don't think it's fair to let mouse people bully controller people. You want to fight against beatable opponents and most of the time keyboardists aren't. Some people might say the aim assist compensates, but when you're going against an experience mouse and keyboard player, there's nothing you can do.

I’ve been playing fork knife since season 2 and absolutely love everything the game has to offer. This season’s battle pass had unlocks that were based on levels. In no way am I suggesting that a lot of time-played (levels) should not be rewarded. I simply believe adding win based unlocks would be nice for a few reasons.

1) This would help the community determine which players are truly skilled and which ones have spent a lot of time playing (there is indeed a difference in most cases)

2) This would add another aspect to the game. Solo players and those who are busy with real life activities would be able to unlock cosmetics and/or skin variations that show they are skilled even though they are unable to play much. Grinding to whatever level would seem less chore-like and important.

3) Although it is not currently a huge problem, I believe this would help with AFK farming. As of now with the current xp system I have seen multiple posts and talked to friends who believe the only way to “gEt ThE cOoL lIgHtS” is by dropping, immediately pulling the glider, and landing in a tree. It would be an incentive to not only actually play the game, but learn how to win.

I just can't use dual shotguns since it's basically impossible for me to stay on target and/or not get hit in the process of switching between them. Call me bad, but you can suck my dick; not everyone can use double shotguns and it's especially hard since I play on PS4.

At the minute I’m enjoying using the sticky grenades and the LMG as a permanent part of my load out, however a special mention to the tac SMG and the Tommy gun.

Then the Visitor came and tried to take control of the rocket. Rocket initial target was Tilted Towers (because Omega set the target) and that's why it got there first. Then the Visitor teleported the rocket to another area and so on. Now there is a time space break and rifts opened in various places. Then I think that the Visitor will go in the past to do something and we'll get a History theme for Season 5. That's what I think. I would like a new map :D,FortNiteBR

The amount of problems has unfortunately reached a critical mass for me where the frustration outweighs the enjoyment from playing.

The game has always had problems but it's been going downhill so rapidly for me that I've been contemplating quitting. I'm tired of my double barrel at point blank with the enemy standing still having blank shots (no damage) that somehow trigger the hit marker. I'm tired of my grappler locking onto thin air somehow and giving me a 'ultra-thrust' into the air and getting me killed because the height of the thrust is insane (no longer a problem with gliders now but when they go away it will be back to a guaranteed death). I'm tired of switching between a grappler and an item on the floor and then my character becomes jammed and I can't fire or drop the 'ghost item' in my inventory, so in squads I become basically a walking punching bag unable to do anything. I'm tired of this weird auto-pickup problem where it will randomly drop my weapon when I walk over a worse one with a full inventory (turned it off, now it never happens! but now landing on weapons at the beginning doesn't give me the advantage). I'm tired of people warping through my walls even though it's been placed for way more than half a second. I'm also tired of people shooting through a wall over a second after it has been placed, as if my opponent somehow has &gt; 1000ms ping and they are unlagging their shots right through my wall. I'm extremely tired of the ""lurch forward"" glitch that seems to now give me double the random thrust forward that causes me now to fall off the edges of my buildings, despite this being an old problem it wasn't as bad as it is now. I'm tired of jumping out of the bus and somehow by character doesn't accelerate down and sits there as if I'm facing horizontally while my opponents soar downwads and get the good drops.

The worst is insane lag at the final circles when there's a chunk of people in it. Computers nowadays are very powerful and can certainly cope with 30-40 active players in a small little zone, regardless of how much stuff is being built in the server (unless the game is coded by people who have no idea what they are doing). There is no reason the server should crawl unless something is very wrong in the codebase. Watching the skirmishes where even the official fortnite stream on twitch shows the game halting must look terrible for anyone looking in from the outside. It's not just me, but when I watch other competitive streamers I hear them foaming at the mouth about how they can't do anything because the server grinds to a halt and just drops all commands coming from the client for short periods of time.

How many reports do I have to file until this stuff gets looked at...?

This stuff never happened to me in season 2 or season 3. Season 4 started to have problems, season 5 was when stuff got bad but I could cope with it, however it's reached a level right now that is flat out unplayable.

The only thing I can think of is that these are purposely added so bots can now compete, since it's hard for me to reconcile that the company can throw 200 million dollars at competitive tournaments but can't spend a  million dollars on hiring a bunch of developers to fix game breaking problems?

Before I come on posting I ask myself:

- Is it my internet? No, my internet is fine and other games play fine
- Am I somehow getting worse? Not relevant because these problems are not skill related, especially when you shoot a player standing still right in front of you with a shotgun and the hit tracers activate and do no damage
- Is it my connection to the server? My ping is always 20-30 and I have zero packet loss...

Any words of encouragement? Is there a way to get dev attention? This really sucks. I've played lots of competitive games in my life since the late 90's (I am getting old) and this is by far the worst experience I've had in my life to date. I play fortnite competitively because the battle royale mode is extremely competitive by definition and luckily lots of people get sweaty over this game, making it really enjoyable.",FortniteCompetitive

Suddenly a week before the tournament, Ubisoft announces that they will be reworking all the maps you've been playing on and you HAVE to play it because ""*we feel that a player's ability to adapt is a skill set we wish to highlight for an entertaining product*"".

Or imagine if you're a League of Legends Pro, you also been practicing for months before worlds and a week before worlds, Riot Games decide to switch the map to ARAM. Yes the game is still the same however, the changes made disrupts the foundation of the game. This is what 6.20 feels like, before 6.20 there was no PVE and it was just PVP.  I'm not saying changes like these aren't good but they are way to massive to be put in before a major event where 1.85 million is on the line.

I know that Fortnite isn't like other games because of their weekly updates but please you can take a week off on updates and do it after the event. Players do other things to get ready before major events, especially if it's LAN. People will do traveling.

1. This is MY OPINION on the current state of the game (2018 fortnitemares patch dropped 2 days ago) I'll love to get some CONSTRUVTIVE CRITICISM
2. If you somehow get offended by this post. No one cares, so there's no need to share it
3. English is not my native language so i apologize for any slips throughout the post


So this is my rant and my opininon on how the game could improve so that epic has a long lassting competive and noob-friendly game and still make proffit

I'm bored of epic ALLWAYS prioritizing players that wont keep the game a float, in 1.5-2 years the fortnite blow will decreasse and the only peopple that will keep playing regularlly are tryhards like me that love the 1 v 1 mechanics(build fights, shotguns...)

I loved this game since the day  i realised this game was about building. I grind this game every single day minimum 2-3 hours per day in solos. i started playing in season 2 and i havent stopped since. However i think this game has some fatal isues, that even tho they will help epic get more money in the short run they wont keep the game a float in the long run.

IMO this is the fatal problem that could ruin fortnite 

Epic hates anything that can give a experienced player any kind of edge in the game.(Fast farm, Dobble shotguns, B hop, Bouncers.... you get the idea) And lets players that do not know how to build the tools to kill anyone.
This is a true story: Yesterday i was playing Duo vs squads and a Default rockin DB Scar P90 and a quad rocket launcher just hold left click well you get the idea u've been there 2 he didnt even try to build. That gets me so triggered.

This kind of gameplay dosent promote a skill based competive game. it just give mediocre players the ability to some times kill experienced players. Let think for a second. Timothy a 14 yr old kid has under average winrate, because he justs barrel stuffs peopple how is this player gonna improve and have a positive experience playing this game if his play style dosent let him improve has a player.

This wont just be me ranting for 5 pages this are my ideas to impove the game:

Add a permanent ""competivie"" Game mode. 
     It dosent need to have a ranked system. just a game mode that allows players to grind and consecuently improve by playin  against players that also want to be the best (Actual competive players) this mode shouldn't be inherently noob friendly, if u want to learn the game you can play the regular br mode. The competitive mode should nerf rocket dmg by just a bit, give more health to buildings primary wood, remove the shotgun dellay, let the players fast farm (because is something that would make farming more fun and we would spend less time farming and more time farming), add back the B hop add back the bouncers. And the  patches for this game mode should be acoording to what the competive community wants.

Basiclly any changes that promote a deep knowledge and add an extra layer of depth to the game are wellcome.

 A good example is r6 siegue  there is 2 game modes casual and ranked in casual the teamwork and communication is less important but in ranked is the most important part of the game. In fornite it would be the same but with building and outsmarting the enemy.
You can leave the normal BR mode as it has been, by patching acoordin to what most of the player complains about

If at any point in time epic add this to the game fortnite could be the next wow ( a game that hardcore fans will still come 15 years latter and epic would stay make proffic out of it) With this added to the game basiclly everydoby would be happy, not competitive players could just go to the normal BR mode and p90+ BD peopple in the face, competitive players would be supper happy because they feel like they are actually improving and each game would be a leaning experience,and epic would be supper happy because the would still make a lot of money.

one more thing the zombies late game are the worst thing ever, i love them to get some shield and loot but in late game is impossible to build figth anyone

This is all for me thanks for hearing my opinion. See you on tilted/wild west

Mir0 in particular seems to win everything he touches and we know how good he is with Magin as his teammates. Regardless of the circumstances in any tournament, these two player's pure mechanical talent, chemistry and game sense mean they will always be favourites.

**The surprise factor**

Competitive Fortnite has had somewhat of a community for 10 months now and in this time somewhat of a way that all competitive Fortnite is player with turtling and lots of building but few build battles and so on has evolved. Team Liquid in particular are by far the most studied Fortnite players. 

As strategies develop to beat other players, people develop counter strategies to those. And this leaves players unable to deal with very basic, obvious, strategies which should be easy to deal with. PAX was a prime example of this, with few players knowing how to cope with Aydan's 'lick a stamp and send it' early game mentality, but as we saw last week players have started to adapt.

People make fun of Magin for 90ing to the sky limit before actually firing a bullet but I imagine NA players in particular will struggle to find counters to this strategy, which will be punished less than ever due to the glider redeploy mechanics which have just been added.

**They don't fear Zombies**

One thing the new mechanics added last minute into the game have done is completely destroyed the viability of low ground. Many top players, most notably Poach and Aspect, like to take advantage of the lack people contesting ultimate low ground, the fact fall damage is impossible, and the fact that you only have to worry about people above you who are probably being bullied from those lucky highgrounders anyway. Not anymore though. Shoot highground down? (not that you will have time with the never stopping storms), well the people above just glide to the next layer. And while you don't have to worry about being bullied by people below you, instead you will have vast swarmths of zombies eating at your ass.

Thing is that this duo simply don't touch lowground. Mitr0 particularly is known for challenging height aggresively whenever possible. These two know how to move up in end games even without a grappler or launchpad or rift to go better than pretty much anyone else, and I think the fact that they will be better at making endgame without being at the bottom of the map every time will serve them extremely well for this tournament, and when combined with the other two points make them the favourites for this tournament.

Many believe there are lots of things being done that cater to fun gameplay but not competitive gameplay.

It boils down to Casual vs Competitive. I believe that they do NOT mix under the same playlist. When you constantly add new things (we assume) you guys are trying to make the game ""fresh"" so it won't get stale. But from a competitive standpoint change isn't always good, and in this case with 2.0 update we as a competitive community are furious with how the game is. 


There's a line you have to draw somewhere. Between focusing on the competitive nature of the game and focusing on the ""fun"" or causal side of the game. And there will always be controversy until you guys draw that line.",FortniteCompetitive
43,randomthrowaway672,1540487046,9rc679,54,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9rc679/a_realization_about_62/,1,A realization about 6.2,"Like many of you, after the patch released, I was thinking ""what the hell is epic doing??!!"".  Instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon, I pondered about what epic's reasoning could be.  Then It hit me: everything in this update minimalizes rng.  I've been following the OW and CSGO esports scene for two years, and the main argument against fortnite being an esport is the amount of rng involved.  When you can be three times better than every other player in the lobby and still lose, how can it really be an esport?  Well, this update takes a massive part of that rng out, which really helps in competitive play.

&amp;#x200B;

No shields ? Farm some zombies.  No loot? Farm some zombies.  No (insert utility item here)? Farm some zombies.  Get cucked by storm? Glide away.  Get caught in a clusterfuck? Glide away.  Ever since the update, I haven't found anyone without shields that didn't just come out of a fight or farming zombies.

After playing/scrimming these 2 days, I think if epic makes a couple changes It could really bring the game to a comfortable pace and level of rng.  However, here a few changes I think they should make:

1. Keep the zombie spawners, but make the most powerful zombies (the ones that give the best loot) only spawn in corrupted zones after the 1st circle or some time period.  This would allow every player to get decent loot in shields but to get the best loot you'd have to contest the corrupted zones, creating a high risk-high reward dynamic while not allowing players to get that loot early game by dropping on the corrupted zones.

2.  Despawn all zombies after the 3rd or 4th circle.  This would eliminate the problem of having zombies destroying your   
builds or giving away your position late game, at this point everyone should have weapons and shields anyway.

3.  This builds on #1, but make the regular spawners/zombies only drop blue rarity and below items.  This just reinforces   
the idea that to get the best loot you either need to kill players or contest the corrupted zones (besides getting lucky   
at the houses outside of salty).

Anyways, that's all, if you have any feedback, disagreements, or suggestions post them in the comments, I'm always open to a good discussion.",FortniteCompetitive

**Context:** 
&gt; **Me**: The zombies and gliders are to make the game seem more fun and less difficult. Add that with TwitchCon, where all the good players are, you have the perfect commercial.

&gt; **Answer**: Reviving a teammate in front of zombies or healing in such a tournament, common! bad commercial or advertisement.

**My answer to this, what this thread is about:**
Sure, for us. But people that haven't played the game at all will just think it's funny, scary, etc. Atleast if you're a bit young/less sceptical.

Also, you can still do both these things if you're only getting pressured by zombies for what I know. What you have to do is keep repairing the walls the zombies are trying to break - this shouldn't stop you from healing or reviving someone. Also if you're 1 floor up or building with metal you should be good.

What zombies does is basically work as a secondary pressure to other people already shooting at you, and give you alot of loot while making alot of sound. They won't kill you, and if you kill them, you'll get shields, ammo and stuff. What they do is up the amount of good loot players have, which in turn makes the game seem easier because now you have several players with DB, heavy shotugns, scar, heavy snipers and rocket launchers/other types of splodes.

These are generally easier to use effectively and before only a small amount of people had them. Now everybody does.

They also make alot of noise so it will be harder for even pros to keep control of the situation they're in.

Then there's the gliding mechanic, which makes rotations and build fights basically pointless, which both are pretty difficult concepts to understand and master for new players. Less difficult things, more fun.

And the last, moving circle removes the boring heal off endings that alot of people complain about. Me personally wasn't bothered by it at all since there was some tricks you had to learn, but now everyone basically has to pile on top of each other with insane amounts of lag and hope to get a good shot in to win.

To me this is a bit scary because it speaks to the fact that Epic are slowly giving up on the competitive scene as it was, and that they want to use this stupid ""players have to adapt"" argument to make their game essentially easier, more RNG which means less competitive and more a funsie game for the kids.",FortniteCompetitive

That might be hard to hear especially when you love Fortnite as much as I do and all the mechanics but there is no way Fortnite will take any good e-sport paths when Epic has TRULY no clue of what they're doing.

Either they have no clue, either they wanna satisfy another part of the community which is bigger. But this has no importance, what we know now is that Fortnite is in bad hands for the e-sport scene, no game as big as fortnite ever made that kind of mistake in my opinion.

All of you that are losing your mind over some changes are just childish. They are constantly working to improve a  game, and that is what all of us should appreciate, not criticize them. Of course critique is ok, but I have a feeling that hate is bigger then critique. They are trying to improve their game. If it is up to most of reddit, Fortnite would be a lot worse game than it is now. If gliders are bad, they will remove it, if zombies are bad, they will also remove it. They do listen to their players.

Also zombies on Twitchcon? WHY NOT! I mean everybody was moaning about how competitive is boring with 80 players waiting in boxes (I actually like that but...), now with zombies that will not be the case. And if it be a disaster, remember that this is all begining of Fortnite, and that this tournament as big as it seems for some of you, is not that big, and there will be bigger ones. And those bigger tournaments are the ones that they are preparing for (at least I believe so).

The games I've played competitively and the most over the years are Minecraft,CS:GO,Fortnite. The most important one of those 3 is Minecraft. 

The gamemodes in Minecraft that I played the most were Skywars,Survival/Hunger Games,Factions,Mega Walls,UHC (Ultra Hard Core).

Hypixel was and still is the best and most popular Minecraft server and I will be referencing it in this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

\- First and foremost, the Battle Royale format problem.

First, I will tell you what's wrong with Fortnite and how Minecraft modders,plugin developers and servers have fixed most of these already. The battle royale format has been around for 6 years in Minecraft and it all started with Survival/Hunger Games.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lag. Now let me start off by saying that Fortnite is definitely doing something wrong. Whether it is so many skins,so many new features,bad coding or something else causing it, I don't know. But it needs to be adressed and fixed.

First of let's talk about client-side lag. The game peforms horribly, especially on low and medium end devices. It becomes especially bad when they drop a new update, the FPS becomes horrible and lag spikes way too frequent for

the first few days of the update being out. I get 60-100 FPS on my laptop that I consider somewhat average (Nvidia 930M, 8GB ram, i7-7500U) on the absolutely lowest settings (including dropping 3D to the lowest % and 1280x720 res).

That also explains the 'bot' problem, people's games are simply way too damn laggy but they still play because it's fun playing with friends. I've also seen countless complains about medium-to-high end computers getting horrible

performance and lag spikes (GTX 1070,1080's,16GB ram,i7-7700K etc.). I'm pretty sure adding new features and cosmetics hurts the performance everytime they are released, so if Fortnite ever wants to become competitive they need

to stop adding new stuff so frequently or make a SEPERATE mode for Competitive. A good comparison for this would be Hypixel's Skywars. It was by far the most popular gamemode in Minecraft and they made the competitive playerbase

happy by adding a seperate ranked gamemode that became very popular and featured less players (Original Skywars had teams of 1x24,2x12,4x25 and Ranked was 1x4). The chests in the middle of Skywars ranked maps also featured much

better loot (that gave whoever got the loot an advantage) than there was at the player's spawnpoint, which encouraged players to go there instead of camping. Now let's talk about the worst part, the server-side lag. Again, Epic

is doing something horribly wrong whether it is bad coding, horrible server hosting, not dedicating the servers enough RAM or something else. In the final circles players literally can barely play, I compared it with when I have

bad ping for a few minutes (1000-4000 ping) and it looks pretty much the same. A comparison from Hypixel is Mega Walls and Mega Skywars, both 100 players gamemodes that run smoothly with no problems whatsoever. There are also

way more entities in those modes and they still run smoothly. IIRC Hypixel also tested 250,500 and 1000 players gamemodes and they made it run well after a few weeks of testing but decided against releasing it mainly due to

the fact it would take too long to start (lobbies would take forever to fill up) and it wouldn't be worth it for them to keep paying for idle servers. But in Fortnite when there are less than 100 players in the last circle the

game becomes extremely laggy both FPS and TPS (server lag) wise and Epic still hasn't fixed or improved it at all. Not only have the not fixed it, they also force people in Duo tournaments to leave the game immediately if

they died and not allow them to help their teammate who is alive and provide crucial information for them IN A TOURNAMENT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. Maybe a simple Quality over Quantity fix to buy better servers but

less of them and make people wait in queue times would be a good fix, but then again don't tell me millions of dollars can't buy you plenty of good servers.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Luck. Simply said, this game is too dependant on luck. There will always be a factor of luck in a very competitive game, but it is too high in Fortnite currently.

Bloom is based on luck way too much and should be replaced by a new system, AR battles are always 50/50 who gets the luck of the Bloom Gods. A good replacement would be a spray pattern system like in CS:GO that is 90%skill 10% luck.

It would probably need to be quite a bit different than CS:GO's spray patterns for various reasons that differentiate battle royale from other games.

Landing is also luck dependant for the most part,

there is only so much you can master before the luck takes over. Let people go all the way down and not have to idle in air for 10-30s would be a fix that is worth trying IMO.

Minecraft Hunger/Survival Games and UHC servers lowered the luck and higher the skill factor by providing players with 'Kits' at the start of the game. You could choose whether you wanted to have

a close-range,medium-range weapon, healing or something else from the very start depending on what your playstyle is. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- This is a small but important one, let people drop the item they're holding with a keybind. Minecraft,CS:GO do this and there is no reason Fortnite shouldn't add it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Not being able to build on certain surfaces. Do what needs to be done to fix this Epic and stop giving excuses. If there is no other way just use the method that Minecraft used plenty of times, replace it.

What I was trying to say is replace roofs of houses with pre-edited stairs and pyramids, if there is REALLY no other way of fixing this. Also props to Epic because they fixed not being able to build by vehicles, a step in the

right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Meta changes. Yes, doing them every so often is good, but Epic is playing with this like a kid plays with toys. Without too much detail, removing and adding weapons just for the fun of it and making the biggest meta change in

the game's history 2 days before a multiple million dollars tournament is ridicilous and unnaceptable. And also adding PVE Mobs to a multiple million dollar tournament 2 days before it starts is also on the high end of crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crosshair. Just let us customize the crosshair like in CS:GO, the default crosshair is horrible whether you want to accept it or not, Epic.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Rewards for kills. Here's what Minecraft successfully did to reward the incentive of going for kills that would also benefit Fortnite. The most important one IMO is giving players a higher chance of getting the next zone closer

to them depending on how many kills they have. Example 3 players are alive in a small zone, one player has 9 kills the other two have 1 and 0. The player with 9 kills would have a 80% chance of getting the zone closer to him,

the player with 1 kill would have a 15% chance of getting the zone closer to him and the player with 0 kills with have a 5% chance of getting the zone closer to him. 

Another good one is to reward players with a slurp effect of 100 (the normal slurp is 75) for kills. Obviously the amount would have to be higher in competitive play then in public lobbies.

This would not make it too op (like having full health right after killing someone) but it would still get you closer to where your health was before the fight over a period of time.

Also, rewarding 100 of each material per kill would be something worth trying out.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Glitches. I'm not sure if you guys are fully aware of how much adding new content and subsequently adding new bugs and glitches ruins competitive play in Fortnite.

As I already said, removing new stuff from competitive play on the map before it is heavily tested for bugs needs to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

\- There are plenty of other problems with competitive Fortnite BR, but I think I adressed the most important ones, except the biggest one that the majority of you might not be aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Epic's Bubble. This is the one that would fix the majority if not all of the problems I explained above.

Their little safe bubble that they don't let anyone else in. They don't let the community create Mods for the game or Custom Servers/Maps. Now, why is this such a big deal? Well let me explain to you what the Optifine

Mod from Minecraft does. It allows the user to customize the game to maximize performance. It improves FPS vastly, I get 80-120 FPS without it on Minecraft and 170-240 with it. There could definitely be something like that

made for Fortnite, if Epic would just let the community do that.Oh, and also imagine what the community would be 

able to do if you'd let them create maps like CS:GO does. And imagine how many cool gamemodes we would have if they'd let us create custom servers along with custom maps. Obviously add some limitations so that the normal

lobbies would still be viable and fun to play in though, because at the end of the day they are a big part of Fortnite's success.

Did I also mention the countless amazing Minecraft mods that improve the HUD (and add custom HUD information), customize how your inventory looks and other amazing stuff that could be done for Fortnite?

To put things into perspective, I currently play on an all-in-one pc that uses a laptop-grade graphics card (650M). 

I have everything set to low with 60% 3D resolution while barely hitting 50-55 fps. I’ve been playing since mid S4 and while I feel like I’ve improved tremendously in s5 I think I’ve sort of plateaued since. A little context, my kd hovers at around 2.8 in solos. 

Three questions, really -

1) Do you think it’s even possible to play at a competitive level with my current setup?

2) How much should I be looking to spend for a complete PC setup (including a monitor and less peripherals)

3) I’ve been told that the difference between 60 and 144hz is night and day; but how about 144 and 240? Would you say its worth the premium?

Thanks in advance guys",FortniteCompetitive

So while you're reading my post, keep in mind that while I'm nowhere near the level of the pros, I'm still good enough to contribute meaningful feedback.

I'm going to split my post into three sections: Re-deploying gliders, Zombies, and Miscellaneous. This should let me cover each major change they've made, and everything that this sub is currently upset about. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Redeploying Gliders:

This is one of the most controversial changes in this patch. While it is true that is drastically changes the game, and even I agree that it's ridiculous that they're playing TwitchCon on this patch, I truly believe that this is a beneficial change for the game. Remember back in late-season 3, and early-season 4, when you'd have these great build battles that would reach the sky? Back then there wasn't nearly as much mobility as we have now, so there wasn't as much a risk of getting third-partied and having the entire fight knocked down. Then in season 4, once bouncers were added, and more mobility started coming into the game (hop-rocks), third-partying got worse. The problem was that whether or not you would survive falling from a 3rd-partied buildfight depended on if you were lucky enough to find bouncers. This means that the only way to quickly disengage from a buildfight that was getting shot down relied on RNG. Now let's talk about being able to re-deploy your glider. Now everyone is able to safely yeet out of a build fight. My duo partner and I played 2 hours of the Duos Practice Tournament (ended with 21 points), and we both enjoyed being able to take part in sky-high build fights, and when it inevitably got third partied, we'd both glide down to stomp the offending team. Then once we finished that, we'd continue our fight with the original team. This made fights feel a lot more *dynamic*, and was a welcome change from the previous build-fight method, where one team would give up and try to knock the fight down once they lost high-ground. Teams now are trying to *re-take* high-ground, which is something that has sadly become all too rare outside of playgrounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Zombies:

Personally, this change is extremely hard to adjust to. I've lost a few games due to not knowing how to deal with this, but when I looked over my replays, and watched pro players deal with it, I learned how to adjust to it, and can even see why Epic decided to add it in. Most of the people on this sub have seen pro scrims, where the mid to late game would consist of teams slowly moving in from the edges of the zone, and trying to hold good positions. Players would often only take fights near the end of the match, and everybody's tunnels were starting to bump into each other and they'd have no choice but to fight. But with the addition of zombies, as well as the ability to re-deploy your glider, players are now forced to constantly be moving across the playzone, where they're more likely to pick fights with other teams before end-game. Zombies are also a good source of ammo and shield, which is often hard to come by in scrims and pro matches, due to the inability to take tons of loot off of bots which is where the majority of your stuff comes from in pubs. This means that it's possible to land anywhere you want, and still be able to get enough shield and ammo to suit your entire squad. I also like how they brought back the crossbow as a dedicated item to deal with the zombies, which introduces the new strategy of sacrificing a slot in order to kill the zombies rather than changing position. That being said, I personally would make some changes to the zombies to improve the game even further:

* THEY'RE WAY TO LOUD. Seriously, are the people who designed this hard of hearing? I've had to resort to changing my volume whenever I pass the cube-spawns or zombies, and that shouldn't be necessary at all. 
* I think it would be better if the zombie-spawns had more time in between each wave, but each wave would have a larger number of zombies. Right now zombies are a constant annoyance, but with my method they would become a periodical event that actually takes effort to fight.
* Make them do less damage to structures. It's almost impossible to heal up or rez your teammates with a horde of zombies breaking down your builds to get to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Miscellaneous

* The deagle change is great. Good work, Epic!
* The six-shooter is pretty well balanced. Again, good work Epic. 
* The mini-shield delay is obviously a bug. In the meantime, the same workaround we had last time (take one step between minis) works fine.
* B-hopping was a bug, and while nice it wasn't really intended to exist in the first place. 
* We've been experiencing a ton of lag and connection timeouts since the patch. Understandable, since this is day-1 of a major update, so I'm not surprised, or complaining. Please hurry to fix this, though. 

I might edit this post in the future depending on what points are brought up in the comments, but I hope that my arguments help you guys realize that the changes Epic has nothing to do with ""catering to the casuals"" like many members of this sub like to say. ",FortniteCompetitive

A player can stop chasing the zone at all and sit in a 1x1 way outside the zone for 12 seconds PER medkit. So if a team has two or three stacks of medkits on them they can survive the storm for a minute or longer as long as you pop your medkit by the time you drop to 84 HP each time.

I got to play a few games tonight so I thought I would share some things I've learned. Hope it can help you guys adjust. 

1. Zombies have a different sounding footstep than other players. This is the most reoccurring complaint I've seen today. While the The zombies have a footstep that sounds more like someone afflicted by an ice trap, but almost wet. It's like a plopping sound. This has helped take away some of the confusion and anxiety that all the noise creates. It's pretty easy to separate the two sounds if you listen even a small bit.

2. Use stronger materials near zombies. If you're in a build fight or are building up in an area with zombies around using brick or metal makes all the difference. They rarely get through it and even if they do their AI isn't great so they'll never take the base of your build out. If you need to heal after a fight and are near zombies just build one layer higher. It will keep you safe from the zombies and you'll be less pissed about the game.

3. The zombies are more helpful than harmful. From what I've found the zombies are just like any other resource in the game. They drop so many helpful resources and even give you shields as you kill. Killing a cube, or even a larger zombie, can give you the heals / rift / weapon that you've been in dire need of. Or they can set you up for a great game early on. I've started to look at them more as a loot crate / healing station as opposed to an annoyance. 

4. Killing Cubes - I like to kill them as quietly as possible and only after I've looted and cleared my initial drop. Silence scars and the new cross bow are great for this. To do this all you have you to do is clear the initial wave surrounding the cube than before the next one spawn simply run up and pickaxe the cube. If you are sure that no one is around feel free to just shoot it normally. The charged cubes drop a guaranteed gold weapon and heals. They are super useful. However, cubes give no mats so farm before you go at it. Small zombies die in one hit by the pick axe as well. Don't pickaxe the bigger guys though. You'll lose that fight every time. 

5. Don't farm near a large group of cubes. This is probably the most annoying part right now is that trying to get materials near a large cluster of zombies sucks. My only advice is to just look for other areas to farm. Also, farm before you decide to kill a cube so if you get shot at by another player you're not pissed that zombies don't drop a whole lot of materials. 

6. Zombies swing slower than a pickaxe when destroying a build. If you hear something being broken and you can't tell if it's an enemy or a zombie just listen to the timing of the swings. The zombie swings have a longer period in between swings and almost sound less deliberate than if it was a player. 

7. Finally - you don't have to fight every zombie you see, or any for that matter. The zombies will never out run you, they barely harm you and they are stupid as hell. Seriously, they will de aggro every few seconds or run to destroy a fence at a moments notice. If you see a pack and don't need anything from it just walk away. 

Overall I think they can be a good resource in the game. The problem with them right now is that there are just too many and it's a lot for players to adjust to. Hope this can help you guys in the mean time. ",FortniteCompetitive

Epic have added a whole new dimension of play to think about, now the game isn't just PvP, it's PvEvP.  That's a massive change, probably one of the biggest they ever made.  

Yes, of course old strategies and playstyles aren't going to work.  You're going to get destroyed and it's gonna feel shitty.  That's what a changing game is about, learning and adapting to new features that the devs add.  Remember back when Fortnite came out, everyone didn't take it seriously because the building was seen as wonky and different and kinda unnecessary. But look where we are now.  Epic have succeeded so big with this game because they aren't afraid to take risks and try some really crazy ideas.  

Personally, I think zombies have a lot of potential.  Having them drop shields and powerful weapons gives you an incentive to roam and fight, and helps reduce some item drop RNG.  Additionally, having the second focus of computer controlled enemies allows for better match flow, both for the player and for the viewer.  Fortnite is big on Twitch, and streaming is a really important aspect of game PR nowadays.  Having zombies to provide constant low stress action between player fights is probably going to help viewer retention, at least for the time being.  

Are there problems with the zombies?  Yeah probably.  They seem a little too numerous, and range a little too far.  But those things can be fixed and changed and iterated on.  It's not like PvEvP isn't an untested formula for highly competitive gaming experiences.  Just look at MOBAs, they have lanes and camps and bosses of all sorts to fight in addition to the enemy team.  And yeah, simply adding enemies doesn't mean Fortnite is automatically on the same level.  But there is some really strong potential here, and we shouldn't shy away from it just because it's something unfamiliar and new and admittedly not yet refined.

As we know, epic introduced two complete game changing mechanics: redeploy, and the zombies. Their endgame, to me, is pretty clear that they want to have redeployment as a permanent part of the game. So, what do they do? Add something at the exact same time that's 10x worse so that everyone bitches about that instead, the zombies. At some point, after enough bitching about zombies, they'll remove them but keep redeployment a part of the game. The knights of reddit will post ""see, epic listened to us, they're the best, etc etc."" Yet we'll still be stuck with a terrible feature of redeployment that they meant to keep in the game since introduction. 

If you dont remember, they've pulled the same bait and switch before when they nerfed building, buffed smgs, and introduced the p90.

There could also be the argument they reduce the amount of RNG seeing as everyone is now able to obtain shield rather easily at a pretty consistent rate if they're unlucky with chest spawns by killing the husks that spawn near them.

However, seeing as STW is '***coincidentally'*** 50% off at the moment, it seems pretty obvious EPIC is using this as a marketing kick for the STW mode at the moment, perhaps for the more casual players who maybe didn't up until now realise that they enjoy killing NPCs more than human players!

There's fucking PVE MOBS running around the map on some World of Warcraft shit destroying builds in every buildfight it is absolutely unbelievable. Not to mention they are significantly louder than literally everything else in the game by a factor of at least 2x, they're even louder than farming the metal from cars/trucks pre-steel farming noise nerf. so now, on top of directional sound still being subpar, on top of the ear shatteringly enormous dynamic range between the softest sounds (footsteps in the distance) and loudest sounds (db barrel stuff at point blank), it now sounds like i am PERMANENTLY PLAYING left 4 dead 2 on MAX VOLUME

&amp;#x200B;

is this a joke? im hardly one to overreact, there are very few things that would make a game ""LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE"" (haha epic) for me, but adding a not insignificant amount of endless pve mob spawns all over the map in a pvp mode that has historically never ever had pve mobs is just too much lmfao. it isn't as if the zombies are a kind of totally optional out of the way side objective, they are now literally the main and unavoidable objective because

&amp;#x200B;

1. theyre everywhere
2. farming them is the best way to get loot now

&amp;#x200B;

yeah the absolute best way to max out on ammo and get a stacked loadout is not to contest other players or drop at high loot concentration zones-- it's to find the most remote zombie spawn and farm them like youre trying to get a rare drop in runescape or some shit

How about the storm changes? Sure theres no mat buff with it but its quite a big change i dont hear being discussed. End game circles dont ever stop moving now. Mid game is sped up.

Or the playground courses? Depending on how hard they are, i could see a lot of youtube videos on completeing speed runs of them. They could be an extremely good measure of mechanics if it has a scoring system and good difficulty like cod where they got this idea from.

It just seems like nobody cares about it. I saw a comment about how removing bunny hopping will fuck over peoples drops as they have no mobility now. He said tfue wont be dropping west world anymore. This user was so concerned with the removal of bunny hopping for mobility, they completely forgot that that the glider (test btw) mechanic was just added and mobility was buffed, not nerfed.

In LoL and Dota new heroes are released and buffs/nerfs can change the meta dramatically overnight.

What if the plan for Fortnite is to make it more like Hearthstone, or Magic: The Gathering - where a lot of the hype comes from watching pro players adapt to dramatically different conditions overnight? The biggest events in Magic tend to be pro tours, where the players get a new set of cards and have a couple of weeks to figure out how to succeed with the new cards.

Now I'm not saying Epic/Fortnite is doing this intentionally - but it *could* be kind of hype if some of the major Fortnite tournaments came right after some game-changing update. I think they should be more transparent about this, of course - I imagine it really sucks for pros to feel blindsided about the glider update (and god help us if these zombies show up at Twitch con) - but I honestly think it wouldn't be the worst thing to keep interest in Fortnite eSports high considering we're already seeing a fairly well established pro meta.

This is mainly due to the monsters. This is fortnite battle royale ffs not STW. It's a pvp game, not pve. This cube monsters thingy are another problem. Firstly, they serve no good purpose and is only here to ""link to the theme of Halloween"". They destroy our builds, houses and beat the living shit out of us. If you want to argue saying that it drops us some loot when we kill it, well, it's not worth it. I've encountered some people who were trying to kill those cube monsters and were so focused on them that they did not even realise I was hiding in the middle of those monsters. Not to mention they force us to kill them = giving away our position and wasting ammo.

Also, I like the idea of having a way to negate fall damage but by adding the ""re-deploy your glider"" it just makes it way too simple. I'd rather they bring back the bouncers as bouncers require some level of skill to use. ",FortniteCompetitive

I think most of us here can agree that cross platform isn't fair and things like input delay, aim, and overall pace make us console players at a disadvantage.

Positives: 

1. Less RNG in terms of zone, every landing spot is now viable as rotations are easier in the early game. 
2. Less RNG in end game as now everyone has a mobility item to use so no one can get screwed over b/c they couldn't find a mobility item. 
3. third partying is going to be more limited and fights can be decided by who get outplayed more rather than who got third partied the worst. 
4. hopefully promotes more aggressive play 

Negatives: 

1. high ground is strong it just got stronger, no risk at being at height, but hopefully this makes players make aggressive pushes for height during end game rather than allowing a team to just carpet across the entire game. 
2. disengaging is easier, but there is risk of getting lazered. 
3. probably going to have more people alive at end game as less players will die to storm, negative in terms of entertainment, but positive for the competitors. \\
4. people are more likely to push in the storm as they know they have a way out.

This is only aplied to competitive games, not casual games.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Every player start with 20/10/10 mats.

\- Mats are nerfed from 999/999/999 to 500/400/300

\- This is the interesting part: Mats picked up from killed enemys will be stored at a side backpack with a max of 999/999/999 and are only used when the normal backpack runs out of mats, this will reward the players who got into fights.

\- Nerf campfires, 2 in normal backpack and 2 extra in side back pack from killed players.

\- Nerf med kits , 2+2

&amp;#x200B;

This will have a huge impact in a 999/999/999 ,  0 kills , 4 camp fires + 3 slurps + 10 bandages + med kits , game winners

&amp;#x200B;

After I read the 6.20 re deploy garbage update,  I thought it was the right time share my crazy idea.

Tell me what do you think.

One extremely common mistake that I see even the best players in the lobby make is being far too predictable with their editing.  This applies to defensive and offensive situations.  If they are turtled, and have ownership of their wall, it seems like people often get lazy and will just make an extremely obvious edit like a 3-corner piece or a window which gives me an easy shot too.  Even MORE common is the scenario in which I have ownership of an enemy's wall, after which they will inevitably place their own ramp and try to double edit through their floor and pyramid above them.  I have become so used to countering this that by the time they finish the double edit, I've placed a ramp and lined up a barrel stuff headshot.  I find myself making the same mistakes alot, and giving players around my skill level an easy read.

Hopefully this can help someone out since I haven't seen it in any youtube videos or on any of the forums I looked at

You have to ask them how much they have of each type, tell them how much you have, then decide how much to give each other. It takes too long! It isn't accurate! I don't have any metal!

I have a technique that takes all the trouble out of sharing materials, and is mathematically the fairest way of sharing.

The basic premise is both players must drop half of everything, then pick up each other's piles. This ALWAYS ensures you have the same amount of wood, stone and metal as your duo partner.

This has many benefits:

* dropping half can be done in a single button press
* requires no mental math for either player
* requires no exchange of information between players
* each player has the same amount of both wood, stone AND metal (give or take 1)
* This can also be used with ammo, traps and any other stackable item.
* This can also be done in a squad (players A B C and D) by doing the following swaps: (AB) , (CD),  (AC), (BD). This is two swaps per player so is still moderately fast.


Here is an example (DUOS):

Player A (wood/stone/metal) 100 / 51 / 80

Player B (wood/stone/metal) 1 / 900 / 80


Player A drops half: 50 / 25 / 80

Player B drops half: 0 / 450 / 40


Now they pick up each other's loot.

Player A = (50 / 26 / 80) + (0 / 450 / 40) = (50 / 476 / 120) = 646 total

Player B = (1 / 450 / 40) + (50 / 25 / 80) = (51 / 475 / 120) = 646 total

I have around 300 wins and average around 10kills once I make it out of early game. My editing is ok, aim is fine since I used to play csgo at a highish level (DMG) and my building is probably the strongest part of my game. However, I keep running into the same scenarios every game that cost me the win. Almost all of my games I am top 10 with 10+ kills but die before I can get the win. Here are the scenarios I have trouble with and need help with.

A) I get third partied the moment I start fighting. I will start a build fight or engage in a fight to be shot in the back or lasered  the moment I have high ground on someone. Same goes for after the fight. If I win I would say I have 10-15 seconds before someone has pushed me and has highground during the time I take to heal after the fight.

B) I start to dominate my opponent and get them low only for them to jump down from our build and turtle and heal. They run and hide since there is so much building it is hard to find them. I tend to chase them down and lose highground to try and get them before they heal and they always manage to get the heal off and I never end up finding them or by this time someone else has joined the fight and now I have to worry about 2 players.

&amp;#x200B;

C) Late game. Whenever it gets to the final 10 or so I have so much trouble finding players and almost never find someone first. It also involves me getting shot from some random direction and losing a ton of hp. Occasionally, I will end up getting shot never even seeing the player and becoming tunnel visioned on that one player only to have another player shoot me again. Then I basically run around savaging builds for healing and sheilds. 

&amp;#x200B;

D) Lastly, I get pissed way to easily. I don't know how people are able to keep their calm. Normally two games in and I'm punching my desk. I can't stand getting one tapped after a fight to somebody with 1 kill and 0 skill. It is the most aggravating thing. It throws my game off and makes me play worse. I also spectate the people that kill me and almost 99% of the time they are worse than me in almost every way (Not to sound cocky, but what I mean is their aim is terrible, builds are non existent and just 0iq). The thing that frustrates me the most is that it is these players that end up winning games. The players who just move with zone clean fights and get 1-3 kills. I don't know why but it makes me feel as if other players are undeserving of the win and makes my confidence go down the drain knowing that some bad player ends up winning. ",FortniteCompetitive

But what if you made players choose between the chance at better weapons, shields, utilities and a decent haul of mats from breaking the unopened chest itself? 

This could be very helpful early game if you get a gun or two and some shield and are ready to fight, but need to spend extra time farming your surroundings before pushing. Or you’re being pushed with minimal mats. Players die from not having materials all the time both in pro tournaments and pubs. So why not give players a risk/reward type choice where they can upgrade their mat count, maybe up to 120 or so (100 wood, 20 steel), so a net of 100 counting the 20 mats included from looting the chest, while sacrificing the chance at upgrading their weapons or getting health/shield. 

This could also be useful mid/late game when your loot is set and chests may be still available in unlooted locations, you can get a quick buff in your mats mid-game. I think this would be useful in the pro and casual community as a minor positive solution to the long and drab farming process while decreasing the early game RNG by letting players sacrifice loot opportunities for a better chance at survival and build plays with a mat boost.

Kind of roughly estimated 120 mats, but could definitely be balanced more/less to fit the game. 

Let me know what y’all think.

You have to adapt to different situations, and think quick and accordingly to what your plan should be based on different factors (zone, loot, shield, etc)

Battle Royale is about being able to win regardless about what you’ve got, being able to use a spoon as a knife (horrible simile but you get the idea)

Then there’s bloom. I guess that can be argued about, but getting lasered with an AR in 2 seconds would be a problem without it. There’s also FSA,  so that’s something, i guess.

I played all but one of the solo tournaments. My alt account had the squad pin with an even 25 points. Even after that. I saw bots in my lobby WALKING around...hiding behind trees...doing bot things... even when I had 14 points. 

The first lobby on my main account, I saw ghoul troopers, Black knights, fucking sweatlords. 
On my scrim account I barely saw a few. I scored 26 points on my alt account in less than an hour an a half played. And could barely get 4 on my main account in the same time. This was consistent over each solo tournament I played.

Hey guys, here are some of the key points I took away from watching Chap and 72hrs games from Week 5 of the skirmish. If you want to see my full notes here they are:

r/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYg_GgUSQJydgZM2mG2s9_L6bpy_p9n3T9j8J9rqOYw/edit?usp=sharing

Here is the full video for when I reviewed and made these notes up:

r/https://youtu.be/84P6j-S4yMU

Key points:

\- They have set rotation ideas through early and midgame depending on where the circle goes, this is due to playing wailing so long. Examples: northwest circle, shadowstone wailing -&gt; lazy -&gt; junk and farm out rest of junk warehouse/junk…. Southeast circle, shadowstone wailing -&gt; retail … you can see a comple ideas of this already. They always have secondary farming areas - typically somewhere that would have been already primary farmed but will have leftover mats.

\- Early game, the rift is key in wailing, it allows chap to float around wailing very freely because of 72hrs farming near the rift. Also allows them to get to the rock farms outside of wailing by tomato bridge faster than normal, at which point they farm, go back to shadow stones and rotate with those. They can also scout very well using the rift, chap often scouting north towards risky and 72hrs often scouting south towards containers  for poach/vivid.

\- SHADOW ZONE HOPPING:

They abuse the crap out of the shadow stones more than anyone i’ve ever seen, chaining zones together… in game 6 they made a rotate from wailing -&gt; lazy -&gt; pleasant -&gt; viking in 1.5 CIRCLES. Chap has his pathing down like its nothing. Really good stuff.

\- They appear to just get circle RNG, but its because of their great positioning, they dont stop fighting for positioning until they get center circle.

\- 72hrs typically is trailblazing the snakes/turtles in lategame, while chap covers the rear and places walls to block anybody following

\- Always going for low ground, never really going for height.

\- Game 1 they were preparing for a rift rotate in 2nd moving zone and 72hrs replaced their entire box’s walls with metal in order to delay anybody trying to follow in - potentially forcing storm damage or not even letting anybody follow. 

\- Communication: Chap communicates “Zone” whenever reaching zone to make sure 72hrs is aware and doesnt overbuild… they both communicate “this guy is desperate” whenever someone looks like they are hunting for kills.

\- Really smart and always going for placement even with no heals - secures them points consistently. They pointed in 5 out of 6 games due to placement.

\- They are mountain goats. They love having the natural cover behind them, not allowing their turtles to be shot from multiple sides.

\- Singing and dancing in the middle of the game is how you win….

P.S. I think this may be the best way to post these VOD reviews, as key points with timestamps to the video rather than just the video - this way you don't necessarily have to watch the review right away, and there is possibility to skim. Let me know what you guys think and if you can think of a better way to post this type of content. I think IDEALLY I would edit down the VOD review to key points, but I think people would also be interested in the full thing. PM or comment about it if you are interested in providing feedback &lt;3",FortniteCompetitive

It has way less bullet drop than the other Snipers, does 150 damage body shots (which is insane), and can one shot buildings. In my honest opinion, it takes out a lot of the skill that sniping used to require. 

Whereas, the deagle in its current state can be useful, but it's pretty useless in scrims, as it takes up a slot which could be used for  far more valuable items. 

My proposed idea is to allow the Deagle to one shot buildings too. In its [teaser trailer](https://youtu.be/UCchFCDowGo), it was hinted that this could be possible, so it would make sense if it was added into the game.

I'd love to see the Deagle become useful in pro games. Imagine the plays people could make, players with good aim would be rewarded greatly. Also a great counter to turtling. 

Apart from that, there are a few other (probably unpopular) changes I would make to help the meta a bit:

- Add the same amount of bullet drop to the Heavy Sniper as there is on the Bolt

- Vault double barrel. It promotes turtling and barrel stuffing opponents, very little aim required, low risk low reward. 

- (Unrelated) Add grenade indicator, or better grenade audio so you can see where the nades are landing - not as much RNG involved",FortniteCompetitive

I have nominated 6 players, but there is also an either section for the obvious player (probably lag let's face it) who I've somehow managed to miss. So, here in no particular (i.e. alphabetical) order are the nominees.

72hrs: 72hrs and perennial teammate Chap leave the Fall Skirmish having made the most money from it, after a 4th and 1st place in two duo tournaments. However, 72 was probably the standout player, securing the lions share of eliminations. He also came 4th in week 2 of the solo tournament, although he did die to Chap in Game 1's final 1v1, and  came 15th in week 3's rather weak roster with Spicy as his teammate. Still, he was certainly the standard setter for consistency across game modes and battle royale as a whole.

Aspect: He turned 16. The next day he was invited to the skirmish. And a couple of days later he won! Admittedly though he did have the fortune of a pro teammate (more on him later), a 0 kill healoff win and Bizzle and Psalm missing the queue (or maybe just the prophecy that Bizzle finishes 2nd every tournament somehow). In the next solo tournament he came 4th after a weak final few games, but it was still an impressive showing. He made such a big impact on the fall Skirmish that even Zeke of all people was able to identify him and Zayt as one of the favourites for the final week. The less said about that the better.

Bizzle: 2 more 2nd places and 56,000 more dollars added to his earnings was the results of Bizzle's efforts this skirmish, as the leader in all time earnings continued to show why he is one of the world's best players. Bizzle also came 10th in the week 2 solo tournament, somewhat overshadowed by his Ghost teammates, but his ability to play for either kills, placement or both at any point is what really makes him stand out.

LeNain: The Franco-Canadian player has been quite possibly the most successful duo player this skirmish, coming 3rd in week 1,1st in week 3 and 7th in week 5. Admittedly LeNain was fortuitous with his teammates Aspect, Zayt and Scatch, but in week 5 particularly he showed his ability as a player. He was less successful in solos, finishing only 25th, but I guess dominating the ATK Grand Prix was an achievement

Tfue: The standard setter for solos had to be Tfue. His performances in weeks 3 and 5 were composed and clever and were lessons to everyone trying to break into the pro scene in how to play a tournament. His duo tournaments were... quite frankly anything but. But still, if we had to sum up his performances this skirmish it would be GOOD SHIT TURNER.

I was able to considerably shoot single tap weapons faster than I was with the L2/R2 buttons (specifically talking about the FAL DSW). This made wonder how it would benefit me playing in fortnite, so I made the switch.

&amp;#x200B;

It felt considerably better. Even just playing a few games and getting used to it, it felt way smoother and I felt more confident. Of course you could put this down to the placebo effect, but I think there's definitely a meaning to doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger stops, as you may know, help you press L2/R2 faster by having a piece of plastic placed under your controller for less of the pressing down action. But L1/R1 is just a tap, not a pressing down action. You can definitely press the buttons faster than you would with the native aims. 

&amp;#x200B;

One downside is that you'd need to hit L2/R2 would be to build, but turbo build negates the need for rapidly clicking your buttons anymore.

Another issue may be switching to weapons quickly. While I don't think this is too big of a problem as you really only switch one or two slots most battles, it could slow you down to change weapons, but not considerably enough.

I'm trying to learn how to play claw, and using R1 to do my editing feels WAY better than using R2. I lose control when using R2 because my hand just doesn't feel comfortable and it's hard to reposition while in a fight.

However I believe that it could help some of you and that’s good enough for me. Before we start, I did stream all these games on my twitch channel, so if you’re curious about specifically what happened during the games then here’s the VOD: [LINK]( https://www.twitch.tv/videos/325136992)  (Yes I have TTV in my name, Twitch btw etc etc.)


**Introduction**
I played the tournament on Thursday and ended with a grand total of 12 points. So remember that variance is a huge part of tournaments and competitive gameplay. You won’t always land in a house with shields or shotguns or even weapons. Sometimes you need to be lucky. My aim for the three hours was to try out different methods, the first hour and a half I was dropping safe and the other half I was hot dropping Tilted and Salty. I don’t believe that either strategy is more beneficial than the other, it’s more about personal preference and your own playstyle (If you tilt quite easily, then play the early games safe, mindset is huge for three hours of continuous playing.)


For a summary of all the stats click [here.]( https://imgur.com/a/LLryRuQ) 
In summary, I gained 18 points in the first five games by ‘safe dropping’ and 17 points in the next 9 games by ‘hot dropping’


**Early Game**
Early game in these tournaments are always slow. Depending on your playstyle you change things up a bit. For safe dropping you should know where the chest spawns and locations are, this allows you to farm and lost efficiently enough to push into more populated drops. Drops such as racetrack, containers and greasy aren’t overly populated and allow you to get looted quickly. After this point and sufficient materials you want to push into the hot drop places like Salty, Retail and Tilted/Lake. At this point a lot of people are still fighting and are under-looted/have tiny amounts of materials. These are the advantages you want to press, they probably haven’t had time to get the amount of loot you had because they were busy fighting. 


For hotdropping the loot locations and landing is just as important, you **NEED** to guarantee a house/spot to yourself, being contested early in a 50/50 is a waste of your time and the 3 hours total. Before you leave the house you looted, you need to break every single furtniture piece in there. The 10 wood or brick might be the difference in every fight. Try to resist the tempatation to third party fights early on if you don’t have sufficient loot, I pretty much only third party if I have 150 health and a shotgun. Just because you’re third partying, doesn’t mean a fourth party won’t come and fuck your day up.


**Mid Game**
This is where things get a bit more interesting. I noticed that in these tournaments the amount of people left at the first circle is a lot more than normal solo games. A lot of my drops during the tournament were centred around Salty and close to the floating house/rift thingy. This meant I was able to gain a large advantage by flying to whatever place I wanted to. You waste a lot of time running around and you want to make sure you utilize the tornado in order to stay mobile. 
I did notice that the floating house is a central point to a lot of fights, you see a lot of people just aimlessly flying around looking for others. I got a lot of kills by flying up and landing on the centre house and taking shots at people flying around. A lot of the more inexperienced players will try to contest the house and those are just easy kills. If you managed to tag a flying player you can easily follow them when they try to fly away, free points. 
In terms of the storm, I tried to rotate early in order to not waste time. In these tournaments people are quick to the circle and tend to set up camp early on, so you would ideally want to get there before they do. This is the point where you pretty much look for fights and third party anything you hear. Just be wary, if you heard it then somebody else heard it too. 


**Late Game**
Circle management is key in the late game fights. Compared to the mid game you do not want to third party every fight. As the circle is smaller, a third party means that the fourth player also usually gets involved and that’s an unnecessary risk a lot of the time (This strategy changes if you have 5 kills for example and there are only four people left, you want to maximize points and get 7 kills.) 
Don’t be hasty to push into other fights, play smart and play for the circle. It’s tempting to push every myth sitting inside their 1x1 on top of the tallest mountain, but that’s just unnecessary. The circle is always moving and they have to get out of their tower at one point. Secure the circle first everytime and take shots at the people moving or rotating. At this point skill and building power is key to winning the game, there’s no substitute but to practice these skills.
**General Gameplay Tips**
This season is the season of third-partying. That means you need to be aware of just how long your fights take and the elevation. I try to keep an internal timer in my head as to how long a fight is actually taking and where I am on the map. A build fight the middle of shift shafts at top 5 means that every is nearby, be wary of how long it takes to rotate and react quickly. Like here for example, https://clips.twitch.tv/SlickMushyCrabThisIsSparta, I killed a guy at the very top and am about 8-9 builds up in the air. I loot as quick as I can and make my way down. People in the end game are hungry and will third party as fast as possible. For the third/fourth/fifth circles you absolutely do not want to be at the centre of the circle. I tend to keep to the edges as it gives more control and I am only at risk from two sides rather than four. 
I honestly didn’t see that much of a difference between the early few games and the last games. I definitely recommend playing safer during the first few games because those game will be easier to win at the final few circles as the players are generally worse.


When you get matched with others with similar points, that’s when I would hot drop. Those end game fights are going to be a hell of a lot tougher, and finishing in 7th or 8th would just be a waste of your valuable time when you could have been getting more points. 
Stick to what your comfortable with, in the end the players you are up against are the same ones you always play against. Play the game you know, land in the houses you always land and don’t change too much. I do advise to play slower and be mindful of your own position relative to others, be more aware of where other people are landing, count the towers in the final circles, map out where everyone is. This kind of preparation allows you to anticipate what will happen next and react to it. 


TL/DR: Just read it if you want to improve, kind of.

I want to address that. The point of learning and perfecting 90s isn't JUST about doing 90s ingame because 90s are very situational in a real game. Mastering 90s teaches you the fundamentals of building because it requires you to be fast and familiar with a lot of building piece combinations. Getting good at 90s will help you be better at every other build technique. It teaches you phasing, mouse movement, building while moving full speed, and many common wall/floor/ramp combinations that you would use in other building techniques. 

In basketball there is a very basic move called pivoting. It's when you have the ball and you keep one foot on the ground while turning your body with the other foot moving through the air. It's an important move because in basketball the rules don't allow you to move around unless you are bouncing the ball. And when you are pivoting, since you keep one foot locked on the ground, you're not considered ""moving"" so it's the only way you are allowed to move/turn without bouncing the ball. 

One of the reasons why Michael Jordan was such a good basketball player was because he would always practice extremely basic moves like pivoting, even though as a pro basketball player he already knew how to pivot easily. But because pivoting teaches you a basic movement skillset that is also used in so many other basketball techniques, you are getting better at other techniques when you practice and master your pivoting. 

Same with 90s. 

Don't neglect practicing playing the actual game, but also don't neglect practicing basic fundamentals like 90s in playgrounds because both kinds of practices are both important. ",FortniteCompetitive

It actually surprises me I never see this mentioned here. I hate to type this on an old phone, but I guess it’s gotten to the point where I feel I need to if nobody else has audibly. First off, replays take forever to load. They’ve gotten *so* much better with loading times tbh, where they are at least bearable, where before it felt like I was dedicating close to half a match to just trying to load up a reply lmao. And this is coming from a PS4 Pro which is supposed to be the most optimized console for Fortnite (not the most powerful, that award goes to Xbox One X, though they seem not to be able to get it exactly right on that console from all I’ve seen here). Lately, I “luckily” only have to wait about 2 minutes for a replay to load.

I just see a lot of streamers wanting to check their replay and pop in and out no problem. I personally feel so discouraged to check my replays even though it’s the most productive thing I can do to learn from my plays and what worked/ what I did wrong (especially). I’m glad it’s gotten better, but I just don’t get the

And what I also would love to bring up now since I’m taking the time to make this post- what’s the deal with the inverted camera controls in certain modes?? It’s so unintuitive. And worst part is, it isn’t consistent throughout every mode. I even tried turning on inverted mode in the options to counteract it to no avail. Had no effect on the camera. Most other view modes don’t have it, and I just can’t get the hang of it. At least let us have the option for it or not. 

And while I’m at, when switching between modes (gameplay, third person, drone follow/free), there is incredible lag. Feels like forever til it catches up and loads. Same with trying to switch at any other speed multiplier above 1x. Completely lags out and you need to turn it back down or wait ages til it loads at a later part then you tried stopping it at. And again, this is on a PS4 Pro, which has gotten the most benefits via updates out of all consoles so far. I can’t even imagine how it is on any other system. 

This seems a problem specifically with consoles; at least from what I’ve seen watching most other PC streamers using Replay Mode. It’s one of the best tools to analyze our gameplay and improve. It’s a bummer it’s such a huge investment of time for us where most are discouraged analyzing all but a small handful of our own gameplay, once in awhile when we have a lot of time- vs just hopping in a new match. It’s discouraging and frustrating, and also just makes me wonder why replaying my own recorded gameplay is so much more laggy than playing a 100 player pvp live match.

Just a complete bummer and set back, and wanted to voice my opinion and feedback on the matter. Hopefully Epic takes notice. ",FortniteCompetitive

So the idea of Blitz as the competitive gamemode is pretty popular and something I'd like to see tried, but I'm not sure it will work. Here are a few Reasons why, in order from least importance/likelihood to most importance at the end.

**There is in some ways more early game RNG:** The speed at which the first circle closes in means that a large portion of the map is immediately not possible to land at. This will mean that there will be far more early game battles, which rely pretty heavily on RNG, and are not really the way we want to see tournaments decided. The reason I do not think this is too much an issue though is that there is more loot altogether in blitz, and quicker farm rates mean even the smallest spots are now viable, and you can come out of a single house ready for a whole game. Furthermore, you could just play with... less players. It might actually work in Blitz.

**More Mats -&gt; More Building -&gt; More lag?** This is purely speculative, and the exact reason we have to test out blitz in customs. But with everyone on pretty high mats pretty early, I worry that people will be able to turtle up earlier and so will ensue the lag. Of course, turtling may be more difficult because of the fast zones. There's only one way to find out.

**Less advantages and Disadvantages in drop spots:** By simply increasing the farm rate, every dropspot ends up having more mats than people can fit in their inventory. This loses the intrigue of different advantages and disadvantages of different spots, with loot and rotations being the only factors in which they compete. Maybe if they kept the farm rate the same as standard but just reduced the health of all objects on the map then it would still take less time to farm more mats without tilted towers ending up with as many usable mats wailing woods.

**Every. Game. Will. End. In A. Healoff:** People might not know but epic did test blitz in competitive around May. In the two or three games they tested one issue was very apparent; the winning player never won by eliminating the player in 2nd. With the speed the final circle moves in at, there are often 10+ people alive at that time, even in pubs! The person who took the W would do it every time simply by not fighting the other players. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tXXGH_Dobs) solo blitz custom is the most obvious example of the problem. Aqua, Zayt, Qlarify and Dimes were alive coming into the final circle. Zayt, Dimes and Qlarify fought each other. Guess who won. This was also a common theme in pubs and blitz showdown.

I could go on about the disadvantages and I'm sure the many supporters who currently want to come into my house and one pump me in the face could too, but I think the reality is that unless epic try, we will never find out. epic need to be holding these custom tests, tournaments or whatever to gather data and find out really if blitz is the way for competitive Fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

There are tons of posts about skirmish being boring and too much turtling. While I agree with the opinion that there is a ton of turtling, I think there is a lot of action happening. I just think that the observers aren’t showing 90% of it

I don’t think that competitive will ever have as much action as public matches and I understand that coming from LoL. Where lower ranked games have stupid amounts of kills but at the highest level it’s substantially lower. 

But there is a lot of frustration watching a kill feed tick down while we spend 45 seconds staring at one team/player in a box. Or especially switching from a pov mid fight to someone else in a box. I’m all for storylines during the tournaments and seeing how specific teams/players play out a match btw. Nate hill and symfuhny was so awesome to watch, along with other duos. Just there is definitely room to improve with the weird lulls that the observers put us in.

tl;dr observers need to work on spectating.

Also I apologize if this is a point or an opinion that’s been beaten to death.

405,Axi11aBeast,1540074757,9pyge7,26,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9pyge7/changing_how_the_game_is_fundamentally_played_is/,1,Changing how the game is fundamentally played is the key to improving tournaments,"TL;DR: Instead of adjusting kill incentives and bonuses to encourage more action, epic should disable farming as a way to obtain mats, start each player put with X amount of mats, and make the only way to obtain mats throughout the match be through eliminations, which drop a set amount of materials. This would encourage aggresive play to be better set for endgame, and discourage players from farming up then camping circles and waiting for zone.


So I originally started this off as a comment but thought it might warrant it's own post to garner some feedback and see what people think. IMO I think Epic should be doing more to experiment with more drastic fundamental changes to how the games function in these skirmish events; as opposed to just tweaking the points awarded and incentives for kills. The biggest issues people (viewers and players) have seem to be not enough action mid game, too many players in final circle, ""camping"" and ""turtling"" end game, and obviously the server issues.

 Server issues aside, I think the changes to consider would be to how materials operate. Watching players farm up for 2k+ mats is not entertaining, nor fun for the players. Building is what makes Fortnite the game it is, but admittedly I can see how the tunneling and massive builds endgame can be confusing for new viewers, frustrating to watch, or just generally limit the action. In general Fortnites biggest asset and draw in building is also what hurts it, in that building is so strong. 

So in order to keep what makes Fortnite special (building) while still pushing the games towards being more action paced I think the things Epic should look to be testing are how materials work. By testing game types where players all start with X amount of mats, they cannot get more by farming, only from kills, and kills then guarantee X amount of mats. In this way players that are not actively fighting and getting kills, though not putting themselves at as much risk to dying early, wont be rewarded by just going to circle as they will only have whatever mats they have left over from the initial amount. Instead, the players that have been actively fighting will be rewarded, not essentially punished the way that they are now by having limited mats upon getting to final circles, having used them in previous engagements. 

Obviously many tweaks could be made to this, and adjustments would have to be made to balance and find what works, but clearly kill incentives, differing point structures, formats, etc. have shown that they have little effect on pushing action one way or another. Thus I think the solution would be to begin testing larger changes such as the idea proposed here. 


Also I have not been active on this subreddit for long, so if similar ideas have been posted my apologies. I know things such as getting guaranteed mats from kills have been suggested, but I dont think that that alone would fix the issue of limited action and players not actively looking for engagements until final circles. Instead disabling farming and making kills the ONLY way to get more materials beyond initial amount however might just do the trick.

Let me know what you think!

Focused feedback will be a thread made every week to discuss a certain topic such as an item in game and discuss its place in the current meta, any issues it may have and how it could be improved or nerfed to match the game standards. These threads are aimed to isolate the main discussion and concerns about whatever topic is set for that week and to keep it within the thread.

We are going to be making these Focused Feedback threads every week with a new topic to discuss and have meta type discussion within this thread.

We have also created a focused feedback wiki page which will be updated with all the weekly threads and you can find all the topics on here as the weeks go by.

The type of discussion we expect to see in these threads would include:

* Its current state in the game
* Improvements which could be made
* Any negative alterations which could be made
* If something needs to be removed completely and the reasoning why
* General feeling and community consensus of the current topic

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been thinking on what Epic should do to step up their game in the e-sports scene, and I'm here to present you the one solution I could think of.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, **Battle Royale simply can't be played at competitive level**, especially Fortnite and let me tell you why I think this:

&amp;#x200B;

***- Load-out***, self-explanatory, while looting you get what the game wants you to get, and not what you need to have for your situation. Successful e-sports, let you ""control"" your load-out, in which you buy whatever item you want granted you have the necessary coins.

&amp;#x200B;

***- Bloom,*** not much to say here, if you think loot RNG is bad, you get shooting RNG aswell in this game... if you don't FSA every shot, you're just hoping to be lucky enough to hit your shot (although you can manipulate your chances of hitting by simply filling your cross-hair with you enemy body, going for the head might be punishing).

&amp;#x200B;

***- Building/Storm***, the fact that you can build your own cover, makes it so that when players with similar skill level face off, they'll keep building through safe zones and most times and end up in a heal off. This point isn't necessarily something bad, as I actually like to see the strategy applied to some of these moves, but at the same times, I feel like it gets boring to watch, and this can actually be the downfall to Fortnite competitive scene.

&amp;#x200B;

**There should never be any space in e-sports for an RNG based game.**

&amp;#x200B;

With this, I'd like to present what for me could be a good competitive mode in which we could enjoy what made us love this game, building and fast-paced action:

&amp;#x200B;

***- 4v4/2v2*** , teams could actually have their spot as in every other e-sport ( FaZe vs TSM for example ) 

&amp;#x200B;

***- 2 games, 3 rounds;***

&amp;#x200B;

***- Knockdown enabled;***

&amp;#x200B;

***- Both teams spawn at same POI, chosen by home team;***

&amp;#x200B;

***- Start with 500 each mats;***

&amp;#x200B;

***- Have a value for each item***, and give players at first round just enough to buy 2 uncommon items, or 1 common, or maybe buy 1 uncommon and save up for a rare one next round;

&amp;#x200B;

\- From there, your ***kills, assists, revives would give you coins*** for you next rounds.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this could be a good beginning in finding alternate ways to make Fortnite a real e-sport.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think that could be changed, and what other solution you'd have :)",FortniteCompetitive
425,riseoftheorange,1540049524,9pv1fu,51,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9pv1fu/why_epic_should_change_the_default_competitive/,1,Why Epic should change the default competitive mode to Blitz,"The largest complaint in the fall skirmish and the biggest issue with pro play in general is the turtle meta, and its subsequent impact on server issues and lag. The turtle meta can be fun to watch, but it often results in terrible lag and sometimes in heal offs.

I don't think kill incentives are going to change this, outside of completely eliminating placement points (e.g. kingpin), but we all know that format was trash and doesn't reward you for playing Fortnite BATTLE ROYALE.

Switching the gamemode to blitz, however, may help solve these issues. In standard play, players can land on the outskirts of the map, farm 2000 mats in 5 minutes, then hit a rift to get to the zone. In Blitz, however, players cant do this. Landing on the outskirts would still work because of the moblity items, but you would be punished for doing this by not having the time to farm mats. Using the blitz mode would also force players to land closer together in areas like dusty, salty, retail, shifty, and tilted and force early game fights.


The end result of this would be, from my estimate, roughly a 20% decrease in the number of players alive in the final zones, and a lot less materials available, meaning players would have to be resourceful and not be able to play low ground in a 1x1 for a healoff.",FortniteCompetitive

I feel like this is kinda useless because in a fight you will rarely be focusing on something on the very edge of your screen because you will be focused on building and editing and it makes it harder to hit your shots.

But Logitech is sponsoring Epic so pro players are forced to use their product, but in that case atleast let people choose what kind of logitech mice they want to use, or atleast have more than one option.

Someone mentioned in a comment, ""imagine if they made NBA players use the same model and size shoes for games"" and at first I thought it would be funny having someone with giant feet using a size 6 but it occurred to me, thats exactly what we're doing here. The logitech G-Pro is super small mouse, I would know, I have one. And I switched to the G403 simply because its larger and still light weight which makes my large hands much more comfortable.

Having multiple offerings from logitech should atleast allow players some degree of choice so they can actually perform well as using a mouse shape thats not suited for you can actually make you aim and play worse. Also some people require more than just 2 side buttons to play, for example Daequan uses an MMO mouse to play and he uses all those numbers on the side, allowing a Logitech g600 would let players like him and many others play. 

TL;DR: If your going to use Logitech products, at least give players more options from Logitech. Or just dont do this sponsored bullshit to begin with. ",FortniteCompetitive

I have been playing fortnite for quite a long. I have spent enough money and time into it.

It really kind of hurts and i don't know if I'm improving at the game. Lately My family doesn't like me spending time on the game. I'm kinda broken and don't know what to do. I would like to quit but I spent enough in the game and bought STW as well. So something doesn't let me quit as well. 

Any Advice that you could give me? At this point I don't know what to do.

We get there at 3:45 and sign in with the rules being that each team plays 2 public games, scored based on kills and placement. There are 10 teams (40 people) and 8 laptops to play on and the tournament starts at 5:00 while phase 2 (private games of the top team from each store) starts at 8:00. After 2 hours only 4 teams had even finished their games, making the store change the rules to be that we play one game, which they technically shouldn’t even be allowed to do. Then comes 8 pm and only 7 teams in all had played. Whats their solution? Tell us to leave after being there waiting for over 4 hours when we were suppose to play. Also, multiple of the teams that played had children that were clearly too young to play (tournament was 14+ years only), essentially meaning that they had ineligible teams that wouldn’t even be able to claim prizes had they done well. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend to not go to these events as the headsets they required people to use barely worked as well as there being essentially no voice chat between you are your teammates and the overall experience, including people that got to play, was terrible. Also many of the people there, including my whole team, had to drive for over an hour to get to the place meaning we all essentially wasted over 7 hours for nothing.

I’m sorry that the games were laggy. It hurts everyone when that happens and no one wants to see it happen. Obviously as a caster you don’t want to highlight that issue. after sitting down and talking with them afterwards, it’s something that they want to completely eliminate. It’s not a simple task and I don’t know the specifics, but it will eventually happen.

Thanks for the love. I was given the opportunity to cast at twitch con but I don’t think my schedule allows it. I will however be competing in the streamvitational. Excited to meet some of you guys there!

It’s $20 a legendary skin, and $8 for the worst. Almost anyone who plays Fortnite has bought like 2 of the battle passes and a few skins I’d say the average player has spent like $100.

-But servers are still insanely shitty and low tick rate

- Performance on different PCs and on consoles has decreased

- Customer Service is literally like a 2 month wait for a automated reply

- Every single week they pull some new idea out there ass just increasing the rng pool of a already rng game with also rng gun mechanics (bloom) and then with huge tournaments with huge prize pools

I think you’d have a better shot at actually gambling and winning money than a skirmish cause how fucking laggy it can be it’s like who ever manages to get less lag wins. I know saying that is obviously incorrect but really, say if I was in the skirmishes and somehow I ran into Daequan end game 1v1 build battle and the servers just shitted on him but not on me as badly, I’d just destroy him when realistically when we both wouldn’t be lagging he would out skill me.

Why is there new shit every week? Like really who asked for a quad launcher and why do we need it? Who said “yeah port a fort sounds good everyone loves it, add a retarded ass port a fortress that the servers can barely handle also”? Why is there a heavy sniper? Double barrel? I know a lot of you might disagree with me solely because they’ve already been in the game for a bit now and you’ve gotten used to them but don’t you think that before they were added, you might’ve said the same thing?

I don't see why scoring shouldn't be done for individual players. Say you jump into a game with a squad of players, you all frag out and get 12 kills and the win together, why should those points disappear if you leave the party? When you acquire the points, you acquire the points imo.

All of that is beside the point though, bc the main thing that I'm salty about, is that there was no way for me to know we where going to lose points.

481,DFSRJames,1539975360,9pmscv,214,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9pmscv/you_probably_wont_go_pro_in_fortnite_but_you/,1,"You probably won't go pro in FortNite, but you aren't wasting your time if you're trying.","This is going to be a long one.

I've been seeing a lot of posts about how people can go pro in Fortnite, or posts that hint at that being an eventual goal. 

How can I get invited to the Pro Discord, to TwitchCon, etc?

Or the inverse: I'm getting so frustrated with FN - I can't seem to break through the current plateau I'm on. I'm burnt out. Solos aren't even fun for me anymore! Why should I keep playing if I can't get the pin for the alpha tournament? Or if I can't compete against PC players?

So here's the thing - you will probably never make a dime off of playing video games. And for those that wind up making a dime, only a small fraction of THOSE will ever make anything resembling a living. But I believe that it is not a waste of your time to try and get really good at them.

I'll out myself as an old man as far as this sub goes. I'm a first generation online gamer. I got really good at games no one has ever heard of, like Duris, Land of Bloodlust, or Tele-Arena. I practiced, conceived of strategies, wrote and talked for ages about how to master these games that no one could ever make a red cent off of. My parents and non-gamer friends told me I was wasting my time.

Fast forward 25 years, and I'm here to tell you: my time was very well spent. My professional life is going swimmingly, and many of my former online video game friends are doing well for themselves as well. 

Why? Well, at a pretty young age we practiced *mastering things*. We learned how to negotiate with each other, how to do well under pressure, and how to pick ourselves up from huge disappointments. The games we played had real stakes. Not in terms of dollars and cents, but how it *felt*. When I started trying to master things that actually would make me money, the process was exactly the same. If I could figure out how to finally beat the Evils in Duris, you bet your sweet ass I could figure out how to make a profitable website. 

You're sitting there grinding your 90s, or watching Speedy Gonzalez videos on some tactic that will up your winrate by .9%, or relentlessly changing your binds/res/whatever else to try and make yourself as good as possible at Fortnite.

If you don't go pro, some people in your life will tell you you wasted your time. *This is only true if you believe them.*

Get used to the process of improving at things. Keep track of what learning techniques work best for you. Keep track of what your ideal work/practice conditions are. When you're ready to try to make a living, you just need to find something that you can bring that same level of attention and energy toward. There are ""bots"" in every field of work that are just waiting for you to stomp them - but it's a matter of finding the right game. Most people just wind up being one of those real-life bots, being a replaceable cog in a machine being dominated by the bigger players. That doesn't have to be you.

Most of all, I just want to let you know that you almost certainly CAN make a living doing something that will interest you as much as Fortnite is, but it will take a similar amount of effort and interest. When you first picked up Fortnite you probably sucked really bad at it, and the same is probably true for other ways you could make an interesting living as well. But if you really care about something, you have seen how quickly you can improve. 

When the next thing in your life feels hard, remember how counter-intuitive 90s were at first, or how clumsy you felt trying to use bouncers properly. And remember that you figured it out.

You'll prove all the gaming-haters wrong not by making a million dollars playing video games, but by living happily with the skills you learned by playing them. ",FortniteCompetitive

Guess what. Its a green/blue rarity weapon. You can find it nearly every time in the first building you land. 

It will never go back to the way it was in season 3 or 4. It used to be the best shotgun. But the heavy was introduced, and the pump had to be permanently nerfed. It no longer has the role of strongest shotgun, because it is no longer the highest rarity shotgun.

IT. IS. NOT. AN. ENDGAME. GUN.

It seems that everyone wants the pump to be the only gun they need. 

The heavy exists for a reason. The double barrel exists for a reason.

The pump can still absolutely body people. It is easily the most powerful weapon for its rarity. It isn't as consistent as it used to be. But the heavy is consistent as fuck. And it shoots faster.

You shouldn't be able to find the gun that you want in your final battle immediately after you drop every time. Rarity exists for a reason, because this game is a looter shooter.

Nobody complains about the grey-blue ar, burst, smg, etc. But for some reason everyone thinks that shotguns are broken because the pump isn't as good as it was before the heavy was introduced.",FortniteCompetitive

I want to blame the spray and explosives meta but If i want any chance in competitive I need to learn how to adapt to metas. I feel like i've been improving alot over the seasons and my pro friends always say I'm doing a lot better when I play with them in playground but my kd and winrate in solos say other wise. I'm currently thinking of looking into paying a coach to help me point out my mistakes but I dont want to if its something minor that im doing thats causing me major deaths 99% of my games.

That's very disappointing to be honest... I understand where they're coming from - obviously if you have a special mode that is only available at certain times, more people are going to prepare for it, than a ranked mode that is open 24/7, but I feel like the latter would still be a great addition to the game. No one asked for ranked mode to replace pop-up cups. Epic Games could let us have a ranked mode AND, in addition, have pop up cups as qualifiers and what not. One does not contradict the other. :(",FortniteCompetitive

2 points for top 10 is too rewarding and incentivizes players low and even medium caliber players to just camp all game every game until top ten until they reach 20-25 points (where when, and only when, the strat stops working). 

Camping isn’t even turtling in good position, but literally hiding in basements, sheds, snowmen, etc. This isn’t what the cups are about and it’s disappointing to see people with these playing styles (who I don’t blame personally but blame the system) get rewarded so much more than those playing the game like it’s supposed to be played.

I'm pissed, was doing some solos, managed to kill 3 people mid game, none of them had heals, I was one shot and this guy hiding behind a tree bodies me with an AK and kills me, how is that fair? I found no heals which leads to rng BS.

reason 1: there is a skill to turtling, a player that is extremely good at it is able to stay calm while waiting for a teammate or 3rd party to help them even if they are being spammed at multiple angles. A bot would just die if a good team or a good player was trying to pressure a turtle cuz they might mess up mechanically or not edit out or expand properly if their is explosives.

Reason 2: outplay potential, if you’re extremely good you have a much better chance to outplay in pubs which is another reason why it increases the skill gap.

Reason 3: being in a base is good when you’re in a good position, if some bot just w keys you when you’re playing smart even if you’re in a pretty good spot it rewards the stupid w keyer more if they can edit your stuff because playing smart defensively is a thing, you can still be aggro...",FortniteCompetitive

Your peripheral choice is part of the game. Those who acknowledge that kbm is infinitely better than controllers voluntarily put themselves at disadvantage when they refuse to use kbm.

Mechanics like ads spam compromise the integrity of the game by providing an easy to use yet highly effective mechanic. Regardless of whether or not kbm is better, truly competitive games should be centered around mechanics that rely on skill that reward better players and punish worse players.

As a community, we should (and do) encourage one another to learn new techniques and play styles in order to increase performance. Thus, players who believe that kbm is amazing should switch to kbm. They are super cheap (cheaper than a controller, as long as you don't get an excessive mkb and mouse) and compatible. Switching to kbm will be the best thing you can for your overall aiming and building. If you choose to use a controller (which is fine), you must acknowledge that you are willingly putting yourself at a huge disadvantage. On the same note, supporting non-competitive mechanics to compensate for your voluntary handicap is not conducive to competition. 

Personally, my issue is not ""controller/aim assist/ads lock on is easy mode"", it's fact that easy to perform mechanics fail to differentiate players of differing skill levels (like any other problematic mechanics and weapons this sub complains about). These mechanics go against the very nature of competition.

In no way am I saying this problem is comparable (or not) in impact or severity to other non-competitive mechanics (i.e planes, swords, rockets, etc).

This is Myth's original tweet, and since we are testing the my wall now meta in pop ups, there might be something to Myth's idea.

The version I would like to try of this is essentially where this is no shields or hp heals on the map (like siphon), however you always have an infinite slurp juice running (constant healing). The HP per kill could still stay in as a way to still incentivize fighting, and this would essentially remove any RNG for heals.

I think the Controller and M&amp;K is actually much closer than people think.,"I played with a controller for 15 years, and just switched to mouse and keyboard 2 months ago. My aim is still not equivalent to what it was on controller but at the same time there are many things i can do now that i was slightly incapable of doing on a controller. An average mouse player in my opinion is just as good at aiming as an average controller player. It is not until you reach the higher tiers of aiming on a mouse that you see a real huge disadvantage for a controller player in my opinion, but the amount of people with this skill is very small.   


The using the Keyboard debate is also pretty close in my opinion. Just cause there is more keys and more options doesn't mean it is completely superior. On a controller, i knew every bind, every button to press, my hands were always comfortable. But playing on a keyboard, there are buttons everywhere. It is a real skill to know what to press, at ridiculous speeds, on keys that are all over the keyboard. There is definitely an uncomfortable feeling scrunching your hand together to click so many things in so little time, while on a controller it is mostly a natural feeling. Every button is pretty close to somewhere you would naturally put your finger. I also think controlling your movement is much easier on a controller with have a full 360 thumbstick to control how your player moves compared to an up, left, right, down key. 

&amp;#x200B;

So while i think that there is an advantage to M&amp;K over a controller. I think the skill gap to these advantages are actually really hard for any average player to ever reach.   


Maybe im too opinionated, but i think PC players just use aim assist way to much as an excuse of why they got killed and Controller players just say PC players have a mouse as an excuse of why they got killed. Sometimes your just not as good as the top players, or you just got outplayed in that specific moment in the game. Other times youre probably just unlucky.

63,Loquacious43,1549001775,alz4yk,17,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/alz4yk/logical_aim_assist_discussion/,1,Logical Aim Assist Discussion,"There are so many posts about aim assist and the problem with them is that they are too much about feelings and some kind of tribalism between different systems. I think that because this is r/FortniteCompetitive that the arguments should be argued with competition in mind. I'm completely willing to hear arguments from both sides and I don't want to go into this completely closed minded, otherwise there's no point in a discussion.

First points of contention that people bring up but I don't think anyone actually disagrees with:

* Console players want to turn off shadows (I don't think anyone has argued that this shouldn't be allowed)
* Console players want custom resolutions (I don't know what the limitations of console development are, but I'm sure everyone is OK with this, there should be OPTIONS to make the game look how you want it to look)

Now, assuming console players can turn off shadows and have custom resolutions &amp; other options so they can edit the game to look they way they want, there are still other hardware issues. The graphics card &amp; processor in a console can't compare at all to a high end PC. You can't get the same framerate, therefore you can't make use of something like a 240hz monitor and get the same smooth gameplay. The other hardware limit is the controller itself. The two main arguments are that M&amp;KB have more binds, and freedom of camera movement with precision (because a mouse is generally much more precise than an analog stick). 

So on a PC, the performance is better, keybinding and building is easier, aiming is easier. To make for competition in a cross-platform manner, the Fortnite developers try to mitigate the difference by letting you turbo build by holding build binds on a controller, having as helpful of an edit system as possible (the edit hold system), and giving a very strong aim assist (stronger than I have encountered in other games at least with the LT spam) all in the hopes of bridging the skill gap between the different systems. 

And yet, in the Winter Royale, there were still barely a handful of players who even qualified. I've read some people say 4 and some people say 2 (only one being on an actual console). Regardless, it's a really minuscule amount. It's a weird argument to me because I feel like generally it doesn't make the point people want it to. What is says to me is even with building sensitivity, LT spam aim-assist, the edit hold, etc., it seems like it's just not possible to even the playing field between console and M&amp;KB. 

So if I'm not wrong, unless you want to keep thinking of more and more different handicaps to try to even the playing field, it ends up being an exercise in futility to try and force competition cross-platform. I've played on PS, Xbox, Switch, my iPhone and even on PC, and it's really obvious that a PC with a M&amp;KB is the most superior way to play the game, but that just makes me feel like the goal should be to convince epic to NOT mix inputs for anything competitive. I don't mind in a casual environment to play with friends who can't afford a gaming PC or whatever, but it's not fair for console players to even have to compete against PC players. 

And on the PC end of things, yeah it's annoying to get lasered when you're rotating into a circle by someone on a PC with a controller LT exploiting you with inhuman precision but when end-game comes and it's a cluster build fight that requires a lot of 180 turning, that they'll probably be eliminated due to not having the freedom of movement a mouse provides.

In general the aim assist advocates have to understand that what M&amp;KB players get frustrated by is kind of SITUATIONAL uses of the aim assist that result in some very unlikely consistency that is even super difficult to achieve with a mouse (shooting targets that are: gliding when rifting, flying by in a plane, general rotations where you only get to see someone for a split second as they run past builds, or general mid-range AR spamming). I've died to aim-assist in these situations and been completely annoyed because I'm aware that if the person was on a M&amp;KB it would take a shroud level of aim to be able to hit these kinds of shots, and at the same time I just have to kind of sigh to myself because I know my best option is to build fight them and force them to fight me at weird angles for a controller, generally exploiting the fact that they're on a controller in the first place. 

IDK, I'm happy to hear arguments as to (competitively) why the inputs should all compete against each other.

So I’ve had my fair share of how the editing changes early, mid, and most importantly late game.

1. Early Game - Not much change here unless you’re landing hot and w keying. Third partying will always be prevalent hot dropping but its so much worse when you finish a fight, box up to heal, and little jimmy just edits into your box and pumps you dead.

2. Mid Game - Not much mid game fighting happens in these pop ups, especially as you climb higher in points. But if you get tagged hard out of nowhere, you’re getting w keyed, and you’re most likely dead as boxing up no longer sets you up in a great defensive position.

3. Late Game - My God. Rotating to late zones is an absolute nightmare. Your awareness of other players matters 100x more than before. One guy can edit you from underneath while another 2 guys are above you that can also edit your ceiling/cone. High ground is and will always be the best spot to be in 99% of the time, but having height with this edit change is such a HUGE advantage. If you have height, no one can edit onto you and all you have to do is shoot down at the low/mid ground players that are constantly and solely focused on each other as there is no more boxing up for safety. Height = win in this cup.

Personally, I like any change that doesn’t add more RNG to the game... but this change definitely isn’t the most ideal. 
Some things I would like to see “tested” would be:
- Acquiring the builds/edits of only players that you kill.
- Heal times shortened slightly.

That’s about it tbh. It wasn’t a complete shit show like some people are making it out to be. At least Epic is somewhat listening and testing things out before slapping them right into the core game.",FortniteCompetitive

1. MATS! There’s a ton of trees, and the metal fences give you around 14 metal per fence. Also, there’s a rock farm a little ways northeast from Divot, feeding all your mats needs.

2. Small amounts of people(around 0-3 people total land here). This leaves you ample time to harvest and loot. It also helps prevent those BS early game fights, and even if you do run into some early game fights, the easy mats and huge amount of natural cover will help make those fights more fair.

3. Easy rotations. In this new comp scene, rotations are getting more and more important. Dusty is very close to the center of the map, and also had a zipline leading not only to the center(which has many more ziplines), but also an expedition outpost, hosting 4 plane spawns.

4. Non-rng health. Also in this new comp scene, health and shields are very important. It’s become a meme on how small the chances of getting heals is now(with the additions of dynamite, boomboxes, balloons, and gliders that clog up the med/shield pool), and Dusty’s got you covered. Not only is it littered with many mushrooms, but that rock farm northeast AND a little tree-rock area at the bottom has apples. The northeast rock farm is the biggest apple farm that I know of, of course excluding that one house in wailing.

There is one downside, which is tree fights. The trees are known to obscure your vision during fights, and they get in your way sometimes. This is only a problem mid-late game however, since they only become a problem when you have a lot of mats. Early game it’s a good thing you run into a tree since you won’t have many mats and it helps for cover.

My strategy: Land on the little bunker at the northwestern-most part of Divot(inside the fence area, not all of Divot). There’s almost always a floor loot spawn on the top of it, and to help prevent those 50-50 fights at the start of the game where two people land together, land on the tree and drop from there. Then, loot the bunker and pass onto the 4x4 white box, loot that. Head over to the floor loot spawn south of that, and just do whatever at that point. If there’s fighting, choose whether to engage or not. If there isn’t, continue to loot.

Just thought I’d take time to make a PSA about my favorite landing spot. It is an amazing place to drop, and I encourage you guys to give it a try.",FortniteCompetitive

Today I have a review on Mitr0’s insane 75 solo cup performance just a little over a week ago. 

I have tried to condense \~7 hours of my time/research into a 15-30 minute reading/video review session for you all. I understand it’s a long post, and it isn’t for everyone, but if you are a highly competitive player, looking for some late game rotation strategies, how to play mid-game, and pick up a few 1v1 moves, I think this will really help you!

Let’s get into it. Below I have game statistics, drop locations, and a host of tips with linked clips for certain aspects of the game (for people on mobile...you can scroll to the time in the link for the clip...I think there's still a bug for the link jumping directly to the time supplied on Twitch).

&amp;#x200B;

**General Takeaways:**

* If Mitr0 isn’t the best player in the game, he has got to be the most knowledgeable. This guy knows where every floor loot and chest spawn in the game is, how to efficiently loot them all/rotate between areas, and his drops are all over the place. It was incredible seeing him face very tough pinch situations, rotate out of them, and then recover mats and loot up for end games, where most players would have been stuck in a 1x1 for 5 minutes. 
* The level of play Mitr0 faces is actually insane. If anyone thinks EU is watered down NA, they’re wrong. Just about every player he encounters plays exceptionally well, and a large percentage of them are deagling, w-keying psychos that we all struggle to deal with. Mitr0 plays low-ground like a god, and waits for his opponents to make a mistake or get over-aggro.
* This should be proof that you can’t get down with a slow start in these pop-up cups. 2 hours in, 8 games played, he’s only at 23 points. And those early lobbies are supposed to be the ones you rack up points in quickly. Even though when Mitr0 dies and gets annoyed/tilted, it’s clear that this only lasts until he’s queued up into the next game. It honestly sounds like he’s always having fun, playing freely, and that mentality definitely benefits him. Don’t let deaths affect your next game!
* To the point above, I have a theory about these pop-up cups that I’ve experienced and is evident in the gameplay in this VOD. In the 15-30 point range, lobbies are filled with w-keying psychos, and it’s really difficult to score consistent placement points, and Mitr0 struggles as well. But - I think this system filters out those people when you get to later lobbies, because those IDIOTS don’t score well ;) (aggressive playstyles can work, just don’t push people from lowground, or storm push, etc. Mitr0 gets pushed in ridiculous ways plenty of times)
* Mitr0’s aggressive playstyle really surprised me. I already knew he was a mechanical god, but his play reminds me of Zexrow’s. I don’t know what his mentality is, but it seems like he’s constantly trying to improve his loadout for end game by rotating quickly, looting up everything possible, and destroying anybody in his path. Sometimes he is even seeking out fights mid-game when other players would be turtling in zone.

&amp;#x200B;

**1v1s:**

* Mitr0 is not afraid to take 1v1s mid-game, but he is also very careful to understand when to engage. He seems confident that if there is enough surrounding cover, or if there is a low chance of being 3rd partied, he will win the fight, and takes them accordingly. The takeaway here is don’t be afraid of mid-game fights, but know when to take them.
* He uses a double ramp bait a ton when on low ground. Watch this fight against MrSavageM [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h18m50s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h18m50s). Mitr0 doesn’t necessarily outplay MrSavage because he gets 3rd partied, but it’s a great example of how to bait enemies with ramps and locate them, while being a lowground warrior. In the end, MrSavage gets 3rd partied by a plane because he’s on high ground for so long, but Mitr0 knows EXACTLY where he is at all times, which helps him secure the kill.
* When he needs to heal up during a fight, he’ll often 90 up, and hide under a cone. This is something I never considered, but multiple times he gets off heals mid-fight when I know I wouldn’t have. He’s always healing under cones inside 1x1s, rather than just inside a 1x1. Check out how he recovers from this fight while getting 3rd partied. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h21m50s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h21m50s).

&amp;#x200B;

**Early Game:** 

* It’s pretty clear he likes pushing people very early (if they drop near him), and quite aggressively. He doesn’t get stuck in long campfests/AR fights early game. This is a strategy I’ve always been behind in these formats, because either you pick up a quick 1-2 kills early game, which goes a long ways towards scoring points if you make it late game, or you die without wasting a lot of time. Even though it’s an RNG fest early game, he embraces the format and doesn’t get tilted when loot doesn’t go his way (btw, he picks up plenty of kills with much lesser loot than his opponents early game)
* He likes really scouting when dropping, and seems to prioritize it over claiming the best loot spot in a given area. Nearly every game he’s exactly sure how many people drop near him, and has an infinite amount of backup spots to land in particular areas.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mid Game:**

* While I’m out there hiding in bushes, Mitr0 is super active mid-game, taking fights, continuing to loot, and surviving 3rd parties
* He is extremely aware of his surroundings when multiple people are nearby. Check out this fight, how he continuously looks back at the other player while pressuring someone else below him [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h43m45s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h43m45s)
* If a plane is near him, whether he’s in a plane or not, he’s almost always taking shots. I think this is a really good strategy honestly. If you start shooting at a plane, they usually fly away and disengage, especially if you get tags. There doesn’t seem to be the type of armistice we saw in the Winter Royale going on, so if you’re in the skies, try to get other planes out of it. People in planes are also extremely aggro if you’re on the ground, so by getting a couple early tags or weakening their plane, you’re usually defending yourself from the possibility of them landing on you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Late Game (long section, but most important!):**

* Because of Mitr0’s aggressive mid-game style, he ends up with deagles and rockets a lot. While it might be an annoying/cheap tactic, he’s an expert at predicting where people will be, and knows exactly how many shots it takes to destroy any given structure. Here’s an example [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h55m00s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h55m00s)
* He is a master of quick peek shots through cones and walls end game. Just constantly tagging people. He doesn’t seem to care if it’s just one tag, he wants to tag everyone. Watch him secure this kill on someone deploying from a plane by making a ton of quick edits and tags while they’re gliding down. His tracking is really amazing here [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h14m35s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h14m35s)
* When gliding/rifting, if he starts to get shot at he does the “sweat redeploy” where he’s continuously pressing space and turning the camera angle sporadically. It might seem like overkill, but it definitely works [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h43m05s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h43m05s)
* Mitr0 uses the minigun exceptionally well to shred builds and get tags late game. He takes it over a lot of other weapons/items, including SMG. Utility items like stinks and heals take preference over it, but it’s next in line for taking up a slot in his backpack. He gets a ton of tags with it in this end game. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h43m35s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h43m35s)
* When gliding/rifting to next zone, he will sometimes take height by **landing on the top of a wall.** This is something I never considered, and is a super clutch strat when landing in congested areas. He does it here [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h44m50s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h44m50s)
* I don’t have a ton of comments on this, but please just watch this fucking end-game, holy shit (starts at same moment as above clip). This is Mitr0 at his best, using multiple insane strats, hyper situational awareness, and just clutching up [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h44m50s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=01h44m50s)
* I’ve seen people do this before, but here’s a great example of hiding in your pyramid with a floor under you. People will not suspect you’re there, and you can quickly edit out and get a free shot on someone trying to take high ground [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=02h11m00s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=02h11m00s)
* This should be scrim 101 in pop-up cup, but he almost always boxes up next to natural cover that he can farm, or use as additional cover.
* If someone else is focusing an enemy, he will damage one of their walls, and watch as they first turn their attention to him, then back to the other person focusing them. Then he will go in for the kill. Here is an incredibly smart play where he deagles a brick wall, waits for enemy to forget about it, then hits him with an  deagle/AK/rocket play [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=02h14m30s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=02h14m30s)
* You rarely find Mitr0 in a 1x1 on the ground past the 4th circle. This prevents getting focused with GLs, rockets, deagles, etc. He’ll spend the extra mats to build a 1x1 two high. Watch as his builds off the ground, pumps someone on the ground and avoids what could have been a dicey situation, then claims high ground, securing him two kills. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h18m25s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h18m25s)
* While rotating, Mitr0 expertly conserves mats by always having his build menu out, ready to place builds as soon as he gets shot at. In certain cases he will start building before getting shot at, like if someone starts window peeking him, or if someone faces him, but he almost is never building for no reason. Additionally, when he gets into zone and wants to build his 1x1, he makes sure that walls are placing where he expects them to on uneven ground so that he doesn’t accidentally spam build and waste mats.
* When in “pinch” rotations (rotations to zone are blocked by players, but there are also players behind you), he waits for players behind him to rotate first so he isn’t focused by players already in zone. Here’s a great example of him scouting this out. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h17m10s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h17m10s)

&amp;#x200B;

**Miscellaneous**

* Takes any AK over SCAR
* Drops Gold Turrets whenever he has the chance
* Checks vending machines all over the place, he’s hitting 3+ per game in most cases
* Takes Minigun over SMG often times
* Stinks are a VERY high priority in his backpack

&amp;#x200B;

**Death Analysis/Mistakes:**

* Game 2: Focuses rotating enemies for too long without checking backside in game 2, and gets rocketed from above. Mitr0 checks behind him, sees enemies are low ground, then turns around and AKs for 10 seconds without checking behind him again.  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h04m05s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h04m05s)
* Game 4: Uncharacteristic of Mitr0, makes an unadvised play pulling out rockets while someone is staring right at him with an AK. He shoots the rocket and immediately builds a wall in front of it to take cover from the AK, and ends up rocketing himself [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h56m45s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=00h56m45s)
* Game 16: Mitr0 makes a few mistakes that really add up during the end of this game. First, he doesn’t see someone ramping up while minigunning another enemy, and takes an AK body shot. Then he falls off of one of his builds, which leads him to taking a zipline by accident. Then he over-focuses lowground, not accounting for the possibility of someone rifting earlier. He also fails to recognize the glider sound, which leads to a head and bodyshot from an AK from above. Finally, he tries to get a medkit off when there clearly isn’t enough time before storm gets to him. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h47m00s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368049484?t=03h47m00s)
* Besides game 2, 4 and 16, he honestly doesn’t

To test out my theory I created a second xbox acount and spent the first 5 or so games dying to make sure I had a bad MMR. Then I played a few games on my main and a few on my new account.

• Gaming chairs. You’re only allowed to use a regular chair.

• Can’t use the word “sweat”. Most streamers call every single person they get killed by a sweat. However, they are sweats as well when they wasting 100+ mats to rush a bot. 

• Not allowed to use full motion on mouse. PC players have the ability to move their crosshair like it’s nothing, console players have to use two unstable joysticks.

• Adding an editing delay, since it takes literally no seconds to edit something on PC. It’s one click and they have the ability to edit stuff quicker with a mouse compared to a controller.

At the time of this post, 57% said No, 27% is undecided and 16% said yes. 

To me, this poll shows how ""competitive"" this sub really is.

I for one am awful at quick edits (Regular PS4 controller player here / 3.13 kd) and believe this update separates the men from the boys.

I normally play on PC servers and usually get wrecked by the quick edit PC dudes, which is understandable, and makes me want to practice my edits more. 

For the most part, if you get killed by someone editing into your 1x1, you probably would've been trying to heal and then resorting to rebuilding your wall from spam so either way, you wouldn't have been able to heal which then resorts to a cat and mouse type fight where the enemy tries to find different ways to break into your box thus resulting in a more likely 3rd party joining.

The only change I would have is being able to place traps on enemy walls since people just jump in and spam them.

Either way, this entire sub asked to increase the skill gap, Epic tests it and now everyone is crying about it. 

Editing is one of the most skillful tactics in the game IMO and if you're getting out-edited then practice your edits, work on your tracking and stop trying to drink minis as soon as you get popped!

This is the total opposite of Epic ""catering to casuals"" and this sub still doesn't agree.

I don't really care if the game dies out but I am an extremely competitive person when it comes to video games and would love a competitive environment while I do play so I have a very unbiased opinion. 

Over the past few months, I've noticed this sub says ""Casuals don't know what they want"" which I agree with but when Epic does something in response to this sub to buff / nerf weapons or increase the skill gap, this sub eventually wants it reverted.

Perhaps the ""competitive"" community doesn't know what it wants either.

It seems Epic simply wants a faster-paced game and they are clearly are trying to shake up the turtle meta.

1. Here’s [My Custom Bind Setup](https://imgur.com/a/iLao8TG).
2. Here’s [My Elite Controller Setup](https://imgur.com/a/csAIfXd), using [reWASD](https://rewasd.com).

4. **Paddles:**

**\[P3\]** Left Upper: **(R3)** Crouch / Reset Edit / Repair

&gt;Crouch and Reset Edit are bound to R3 by default, so by mapping this to a paddle I free up a bind and still can rapidly crouch

**\[P4\]** Left Lower: **(B)** Edit / Confirm Edit

&gt;This puts instant edit on a paddle, which is conveniently right below reset edit for quick editing.

**\[P1\]** Right Upper: **(A)** Jump

&gt;This allows for aiming while jumping with precision.

**\[P2\]** Right Lower: **(X)** Interact / Reload / Place Trap

&gt;This paddle is for looting, reloading, reviving teammates, placing traps, etc.

we got a community a tons of ppl playing scrims all the day, also we got pro scrims, you have to gain 100 points to be on those scrims, you gain 5 points by getting the first place, 2th place 3 points and 3rd place 1 points

once you get 100 points you get the trial tag and you need to get 15 points in one week to keep your trial tag

(ofc playing againts players with 100 points)

if you dont get the 15 points you go down to the open scrim and farm the 100 points again

to get the pro tag you need to get 50 points and get 20 points to keep your tag

&amp;#x200B;

thats how or biggest scrim server works

Jump = left paddle 
switch mode = right paddle

Reprogramming the muscle memory that is so ingrained is rather difficult.

Here are my thoughts so far:

1) although it isn’t worth it yet bc I’m bad with it—kd w/o = 2.2 and kd with = 1.5ish—I know that a week from now I’ll be better and it will be worth it

2) the hardest part is the initial build when a shot is heard/fired. One is so used to pressing circle immediately..using a paddle is foreign. 

3) the second hardest part is switching between builds and guns. At this point it’s all conscious and it gets in the way of tracking and actually thinking about how to deal with ur opponent. Instead ur focusing on you too much.

4) the jump part is easy to get, but hard to incorporate into the building rhythm—90s etc. 

5) having said that 90s have never been so easy!!! Atleast In creative mode where there’s no pressure 

6) you must bind jump and switch mode to the D pads and bind those to the paddles.. use X and O for emote and place Marker for example. This means you will be absolutely punished for reverting back to old habits 

7) must have at-least a 50/50 split of actual solo/squad and creative mode practice. It’s easy to do things in creative mode under no pressure, but you need the actual combat practice bc then you’re put in realistic spots where you have to build in a certain way. For example, catching yourself with a floor after jumping from a great height. I never even thought about practicing this.. but this situation came up in a fight. 

8) jumping and shooting has never been easier.


9) I think it’ll take me 7-10 days to completely master.

I’d recommend the strike pack even after only two days of practice—but I’m happy to follow up with anybody who’s skeptical.

I know basic editing and building but struggle getting highground when it's lost since I'm not the best builder. Is highground supposed to be very hard to retake? Recently started doing 1v1's and realized it's so hard to get it back again so I lowground for a bit then try again, keep taking shots, rotate etc and maybe manage to get highground again. The thing is that I noticed I get more hits on the enemy, sometimes even kill them before I try to even take highground again because the highgrounder is usually the aggressor. Thats when i can go for highground and kills. Yesterday I killed a way better builder than me (we 1v1'd for like 6 hours) and I asked him what I can improve on. He said my aim was good but I lose highground. Do I really need highground if I'm okay with lowground? I feel like I'm not considered a builder cause I can't retake highground",FortniteCompetitive

I personally like it, so that the pro matches are at least somewhat entertaining and fast paced, compared to the turtling wars we're currently getting. There are some big issues with everyone being able to edit, including the problem with getting a minute to heal between fights. 

So what I was thinking was to introduce the ""reinforce"" mechanic from save the world. If you're not familiar with it, it looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3arMlBw6xHg). Essentially you would have to sacrifice 5-10 mats to be able to reinforce your builds, which could then negate the ability for others to edit. This would be an interesting way to make the already limited mats have more utilization and a sacrifice dynamic could arise. This could also raise the health of said build so there is still a point in doing it other than resorting back to the turtling. When you do edit a reinforced build it could take longer like in STW to get back to the full strength and in the mean time could or couldn't be editable. I'm not sure about the flaws in this idea so let me know what you guys think!",FortniteCompetitive

Overall I dont think a change to editing is bad, for example I would be every excited about to be able to edit structures that from opponents that I have eliminated.

But in my opinion this edit change has several massive design flaws.


1. In normal gameplay aggression and defensiveness were actual choices both valid. Especially in late game pop up cup agression was very viable if not actually preferable to being passive. Some people like Mr.Savage or Arsen2k are so good in being hyper agressive in late game and its a lot of fun to play like this. Now being passive isnt a choice anymore. Its impossible. Now the aggressor has such a big advantage over the defending person that its very hard to survive at all if your lowlife/alone/under fire etc. 


2.  Traping your opponent in his own 1x1 is stupid, unfair and is the biggest possible buff to traps imaginable. You should not be able to use traps like this.


3. This editing promotes suicide wkey and is just not healthy. No one would play like this in an actual tournerment on the line. It makes pop up cup even worse practice. Pop up cup wasnt the best practice but the most fun one IMO. 


4. **My main complaint though is that the game is just not designed for this feature. For example if your opponent owns an edit you get no visual feedback about it. And if you try to edit it you just shoot and eventually kill your self with a rocket launcher. Its NOT clear if your opponent holds it, if your lagging or you missclicked etc. The visual feedback is an absolute disaster. 
Visual feedback is the difference between a good game and a shit tier shooter**. 
Same with sound. The sound system of Fortnite is just not viable for this. Often enough you dont hear some people at all. Before they had to break your structure which is slow and loud. Now they just edit it and you get no chance. 

5. The editing change makes a lot of fights to  50/50 slug fests. The ability to use structures for your advantage and with that editing is one of the greatest things about fortnite and allowed for people like us to kill and outplay several people in a row or even at the same moment. This feature eliminates this to or at least reduces it by quite a lot. If your alone and fight vs 2 people? Good luck

6. Editing overall is just to clunky for this. Obviously it lacks visual feedback but even with you most likely shoot docents of shots into walls trying to edit. Also its abusable by stuff like macros or mouse wheel.

7. Buildfights become super akward and highground is so good now as any high ground reclaim method is defeated as  he will just open you up like a tomato soup can and pumps you.
Only way for recovering is to reset the fight.

8. People die even faster. Seems like to be a goal of Epic but I just prefer games with a lot of people. It makes the game just more fun IMO. Nothing worse then seeing 5 people moving zones.

We can not definitively state that 20-25 points is where we start seeing stacked end games without specifying the time that has past in the tournaments. 

In my experience, the best way to track the skill level of your lobby is to compare to pros that are running the same popup cup. You will see a pattern of where the top players should be at after different intervals of time. It would be interesting if a legit study could be done to see the average points of pros/high skill players after each hour.

My very rough guess is that it would look something like this:

Hour 1: 12-18 points

Hour 2: 20-30 points

Hour 3: 30-40 points

Hour 4: 40+

Hour 5: 45+

&amp;#x200B;

Some people will wonder why their 20 point lobby at hour 4 has only 3 people left in the moving zones.

&amp;#x200B;

After the yesterday's cup, I found the idea of the edits interesting but too extreme.

My little brother came with another interesting idea: when you are putting a structure at the same place repetitivly within a delay, each time you place it, it costs you more material.

For example it may look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, ...

or

\- 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, ...

&amp;#x200B;

So someone that disengage a fight to turtle himself midgame would be penalized.

Let me know what you think, or if you have others idea to prevent the excessive turtling in the game!

My biggest problem is mid game fights. I’m fine fighting end game. In the lower point games I have got a win every time and I can pick up late game kills, And early game I’m ok with. Once I get to 12/13 plus point lobbies I always get w keyed hard mid game which leaves me rarely making it to the top 10 and usually dying on the 1 or 2 kills I picked up early game.

Anyway, I need some advice so my bot ass can make it to 20 points. Should I work on my mid game rotations and keep playing passive for end game or should I just practice fighting these players and play more aggressive?

Even if you win against a spammer, you have to waste nearly all of your mats just to survive, only to come across yet another splode spammer in the near future except now with less mats and potentially less health.

My suggestion is to make the RPG (and perhaps the GL as well) ONLY spawn in supply drops. This does 2 things that I think help make the game more competitive while also relieving pressure from players of all skill levels.

1) There’s less of them in the game, thus less encounters with splode spammers (primarily early - mid game)
2) They make supply drops WAY more valuable.

Emphasis on the second point. Honestly I really only go for drops for heals but even that’s not worth it sometimes. This would give players more incentive to go for drops and players may actually fight over drops (this would also mean taking crappy gold items out of drops as well). 

Basically by doing this, the splode battles will occur more often in late game where players should at least have more mats and loot to counter splodes that they didn’t waste against other splode spammers in early-mid game. ",FortniteCompetitive

This subreddit can be way too quick to condemn new parts of the game and it honestly degrades GOOD, competitive discussion. Let's try and discuss it in a way to where we can all learn and develop from it, please?


My thoughts:

I approach today's pop-up being fully aware that the competitive community needs a lot more time in this mode before its final judgment as ""good"" or ""bad"". Some have rapidly adjusted to the changes, but for me personally there were times (even 4 hours into the tournament) where I was totally caught by surprise. 


For early game and mid-game, I generally like it and don't see it causing any massive problems as the meta-game around it develops.

Late game is a different beast entirely. In the early point range (0 to 20), I was abusing the hell out of it and it brought a new level of aggression which felt really fun. I definitely felt it as the ""anti-turtling"" mechanic it was intended to be.

The 30 point range is where things got really interesting and intense. When you get to the moving-circle phase, throwing a quick box up to pop bandages/minis felt EASILY punished. Game sense feels more important than ever. There were multiple instances where I would literally just streamroll through low-ground and window edit into peoples' boxes for an easy kill - aggressive behavior is rewarded a lot more.

I think as we get more used to the idea of ""okay someone can run by and destroy me through my own build at any moment"", we'll see the game shift more heavily to:

a.) Generally more aggressive lategame. Turbo-build turtling was a huge roadblock for aggression - in the time you were trying to break through someone's 1x1 you were getting window-edit lasered by someone else. I expect people are going to drop a LOT faster in the final circles (yes, even in pro games.)

b.) High ground (even just 1 or 2 tiles up) will gain some more value for quick 1x1/heals. This was generally true before, but if you were positioned properly you could heal in a 1x1 and you would often get ignored because it wasn't worth the time to try and break in when everyone is focused on rotating to the next circle. This straight up won't happen any more, and I think wonkier 1x1s (1 or 2 tiles above ground, pressed up against a mountain) will give you a slight edge on getting your heals off uninterrupted.

In the same vein, I also think there will be a further development of the defensive 1x1 turtle metagame. Even at 30, 40, 50 point games with good players, a simple 1x1/tunnel was a pretty forgiving way to reposition and/or heal. Now, where you're stopping to 1x1 + heal will require more awareness than before. You'll need to be behind a ramp (and able to quickly edit your ramp), under a cone within your 1x1, and people will need to put more thought into their 1x1 and various escape routes. These things are all pretty simple in execution and theory, but the magic of turbo-building had people getting away with a lot more sloppy play. 


Wall of text, I know - but I find this move by Epic really interesting. It's the first mechanic they've introduced in a long time that isnt' item/vehicle (and subsequently lowering the skill ceiling with easily abused/cheesy mechanics.)

Also, Fortnite’s audio is no where near good enough for this change. In one situation I was in a box trying to heal and an opponent ran up to me, exited, placed 3 traps, and edited back out closing me in. I had no idea that an enemy was near by.

1. Fights will have a decided winner 99% and will not lead to stalemates 
2. Disengages will require a mobility item, if not you will have to back pedal and hope they don't have a mobility item.
3. More mobility being used early/mid game will no shit cause less mobility end game
4. because of less mobility end game, no more 50+ people in 5th circle and up
5. turtling is no longer a viable option, still can be used to mindgames opponents by holding the edit on ramp and getting a kill
6. turrets will become useful. removing a ramp and surprise your opponent is useful.
7. Myth is right that building will be more offensive, but rng will be increased if you want to disengage from a bad fight.(v1 glider redploy is needed for this mode to become good btw. just sayin.)

Think about how much better people are at building now then they were 4 seasons ago. Soon, your average bot will comfortably know how to properly turtle, turbo build and wait until you get third partied while you're trying to break in, this wastes time and materials.

This change directly counters it, I don't have to waste time trying to replace their walls, I can play aggressively, get in and get out. If i miss my shots, take hits I am heavily punished and can't just box up and heal.

There will be more materials in the game, because that bot you're trying to kill isn't turbo building and wasting your potential material loot.

Being better at editing, resetting those edits, taking good shots, right angle peaking will all increase the skill gap too IMO.

Snipers are basically the thing Epic didn't want: someone can get shot for 150 damage (something game changing) for not seeing that one guy in one of the ten turtles is 3rd personing him, granted you tend to build in these situations any way but not necessarily and an AR would have given you enough time before you would have taken 150 damage.

imo snipers are just not a weapon that work in a game like Fortnite that well and incentivizes camping, therefore something should be done about it (imo). rn I can think of two possible ways about doing this:

\-nerf body shot to \~75% of original (heavy\~110;slilenced\~75;hunting\~70) but keep 1 headshot potential (snipers are way easier because of less bulletdrop and faster velocity buff anyways), this would incentivize skill 

\-test how ingame tournaments would play without snipers (possibly without splodes and similar weapons too)

**tldr:** snipers don't work with Fortnite's core mechanics and imo either the body shot damage should be nerfed or sniper should be excluded from competitive playlists.

This is mainly directed at the few Pc players that are obsessed with nerfing ""ADS spam"" and constantly complaining that aim assist is OP. This could also give people a different perspective.

The general consensus so far seems to be ""Aim assist is fine, spamming Ads is the problem.""
So hypothetically in that case the ""slow down"" part of aim assist seems to be accepted by everyone. Which is only actually effective while Aiming down sight. While Kbm has the ability to aim far more consistently in almost every situation. 

On controller you don't have the same ability to aim and AA is barely if not at all existent when

- Hip firing 

- Jump shotting 

- Shooting through windows

So if Epic were to actually balance the ability to aim on controller, the aim assist in all the above situations should be buffed to be closer to the ADS strength. 

Then controllers won't be ""underpowered"" in these situations. This and the added ""cool down"" to ADS spam should balance everything out  since everyone is so concerned about peripherals being fair in every situation. 

This is going to piss loads of people of but that's the reality of how imbalanced aiming is between both inputs. I don't care if these changes were made I'm just putting the facts out there that this is what people should be talking about if they really want to balance things out.

First of all no one has ever said that controller is *better* than kb and mouse and if anyone ever did they are obviously wrong because as Ghost Issa pointed out almost the ratio of controller players per pc player is incredibly small and it's not hard to see why: kb and mouse is just faster at doing everything both because of the accuracy of the mouse compared to the sticks and because of the much larger amount of possible binds and configuration there is on kb and mouse. Controllers are something 99% percent of people pick up because of its comfort i'd much rather be playing on my sofa than sitting at a desk and the reason people (including me) play kb and mouse is because it's just better.
 That being said, there is one thing that controllers do better than kb and mouse which is aiming in the kind of situation demonstrated by Zayt's clip. And is it because of magic fingers? No, it's because of an automatic game feature. Now, Kayuun said a good pc player should hit those shots and if one doesn't, then he should go play an hardcore fps to which i can only say: No, a good pc player will not consistently land two headshots like that and if he does hit those it will be a viral clip passing on every fortnite highlight channel on youtube because of the player's amazing aim whereas if a console player does it it's not that big of a deal because there was a big part of the proccess done automatically.

Is it *balanced*? No, it's not balanced because while controllers have a BIG disadvantage most of the time when it comes to hitting clutch shots it's just unfair and unproportional to each players skill in a 1v1 between a pc player and a controller player.
You can't just put all the good points and bad points in a box, measure the results and say if it's balanced or not since in some situations controllers are OP and in others they are super weak and end up saying shit like controllers are worse than mouse and keyboard therefore every possible complaint you might have is nullified.

So what to do then? Well imo in order to have a proper competitive scene the only solution to have is to separate pc players and controller players (outside of removing aim assist which would obviously kill controller aim) but since this is probably never going to happen since it would likely be bad for the overall popularity of the fortnite pro scene i am out of possible solutions.",FortniteCompetitive

 There isn't an option to choose between one or the other or a slider so for people that play with low aiming sensitivity and high build sensitivity the change is extremely hard to get used to. For some people this change is great, but the majority of players don't edit as fast as they want to build making edits insanely inconsistent.

The ONLY issue i have with removing the bolty to basically replace it with the silence, is that there ISN'T a Blue rarity silenced sniper. This makes finding scoped snipers even harder when I don't think that ""over abundance"" was ever a problem. So I think Epic should add a blue rarity suppressed. Snipers have a 2.5 headshot multiplier so making a blue suppressed sniper body shot do 95 or even 90 damage would still result in a 237 or 225 headshot, which I think sounds SUPER balanced and would make it not feel like sniper availability fallen off so much. The rarity difference, to me, is the only real flaw in replacing one with the other and this would be an easy fix that's well beyond balanced since you can't even 1 shot someone in the body who has no shield with the blue version.

Also, please keep in mind this is a change to a core game mechanic. This plays fast, and you have to be highly aware of what’s going on around you. It’s even more demanding than before. It’ll take time to adjust your playstyle, new possible plays, and ability to outplay your opponent. It’ll also take time to learn how to play defensively. Seriously, give this a shot.

I just died three games in a row in the dumbest ways. This happens to me everyday so I just decided to make a post about it now. 

First game, I’m top 5, turtling and see a guy 20m in front of me. There’s a tree slightly in the way but not full on. I shot the rpg through the window (not aiming at the tree) and it hit the fuckin tree and got me low, then got pushed aggressively right away and died. Second game I’m rifting top 3, only see one building so I land on a mountain. I decide to shoot one rpg at a building then I get one tapped by a random sniper from who knows where (I was literally in the sky trying to look for people and didn’t see this person). I wasn’t standing very still either, I jump around and stuff. Third game I kill someone and he gets me very low. There wasn’t anyone in the building. Someone then out of no where throws a stink grenade from outside and manages to kill me without even seeing me. 

It sucks because I hardly ever get outplayed by a good/better player. There are obviously those times where I fuck up and is my fault, but I feel like I always go out in the most unfair way all of the time which leads me to rage. If I didn’t rpg myself or if that snipe missed I probably would’ve won the game. You hear pro streamers saying their unlucky and stuff meanwhile they have insane stats and they can win games in a row. Me on the other hand, I feel like I have the worst luck of all time. Always getting spammed with explosives or getting double teamed in solo

I just wish there would be more times where I’d go “damn, this kid just destroyed me” with fast editing or building or something. ",FortniteCompetitive

2. If someone is using scroll wheel to reset edits, one of your only options to get shots on the turtle is to jump in. Are traps at 150 fair in this case?
3. Traps could be more important than ever. Will there still be a distinction on friendly vs. enemy walls now that we can edit everything?

My Suggestion is making an LTM replicating this scenario. Game begins on final circle, each player has full health and shield, or maybe just full health and half shield. Loot is predetermined, or if possible, confidguarble in the pregame lobby/starting island. To make it most fair, I recommend rare or higher weapons only, just so there isn't someone accidently selecting a grey tac instead of a gold pump. 

Full mats given of 500, 500, 300.

Due to the server impact, I would say starting with possibly 30-40 players rather than 80 or 100, but with it beginning so late on, there wouldn't be other structures needing to load in e.g. previous builds from players throughout the game, so they maybe could boost it up to about 50-60 max? (I'm not 100% on the technical side of this, as I'm sure I've made a lot of assumptions about Epic's capabilities but let me know). 

My only issue with it is people getting to the final circle, do they all spawn at pre-determined locations or drop down from the battle bus?

1. Setting your equalizer to a neutral state. For example if you have a bass heavy headset the equalizer presets will minimize the bass to get a even sound profile across the board.

2. Using surround virtualizations on the software level. 

What does this mean? Well you can use  

– Dolby Atmos Headphone
– CMSS-3D
– SBX Pro Studio Surround (also found in BlasterX Acoustic Engine &amp; THX TruStudio Pro)
– Dolby Headphone
– Sennheiser GSX Binaural 7.1
– DTS Headphone:X
– Windows Sonic Headphone
– Dolby Home Theater v4 Headphone Surround Virtualizer
– Razer Surround
– Out Of Your Head
– Flux HEar V3
– OpenAL and DirectSound3D HRTFs
– Waves Nx

and many more. Every virtualization has a different feel and different pros and cons. Try them out.

------------

I personally have the G433 and out of the box they are awful for Fortnite, with a neutral equalizer and Nahimic 3 Surround Sound they got from bad to actually useable. I'm able to locate enemies where before I was hearing stuff that I could never pin point exactly.

------------

What do you need is:

1. https://sourceforge.net/projects/hesuvi/

This is where the magic happens.

2. http://audio.rightmark.org/products/rm3ds.shtml

This allows you to test your headsets sounds from every angle possible.

http://audio.rightmark.org/products/rm3ds.shtml

Credit to the people above for the amazing software.

------------

Everything you need can be found on the download page of hesuvi including a tutorial.

For the neutral equalizer settings the amazing community of hesuvi did a list of many headsets that you only have to select from a list. But fear not, if your headset isn't included you might be lucky and can find them here below.

1. I went to the fortnite gameusuersettings in appdata&gt;local&gt;&gt;FortniteGame&gt;Saved&gt;Config&gt;WindowsClient
2. I switched everything that says 2560x1440 to 1920x1440 (equivalent to playing 1440x1920 but in 1440p)
3. I saved the file, and made it to read only.
4. I went to the geforce control panel and switched my scaling mode to full screen, made a custom res, (obv 1920x1440) and applied it. 
5. I launch fortnite and it is in the stretch res I selected it to. 
6. I play many games, and quit fortnite, change my res back to 1440p native res
7. When I launch fortnite again, its in native res. 

What Should I do to prevent this? I always see streamers having native res in their desktops and in fortnite they have stretched.

I’ve been playing controller on PC for about 3 months and I feel like I’ve plateaued. So I’ve decided to make the switch to keyboard and mouse..

I’ve never played a computer game in my life, always console/controller, so I have no experience with it. I’ve been wanting to switch for about a month now, but every time I put my hand on the mouse and start to practice, it just feels so uncomfortable and weird.

(I have a standard keyboard and a mouse with 2 buttons on the left side)

I’ve found a decent sensitivity that I like, so I don’t think this will be too much of a problem. My biggest concern and what I struggle with the most is finding the right key binds and learning how to move more smooth with a mouse.

Switching weapons, building, placing traps, crouching, etc. I’m having a difficult time getting use to what buttons to press for each command. Also, holding my hand/fingers on the keyboard feels extremely unnatural and uncomfortable..

So I’m just asking if anyone has any tips on making the transition.

What should I start practicing first? What sens should I play on? What should I practice the most? Any specific drills I can do? How do I position my hands?? Is there specific gaming equipment that would help? Suggestions on key binds? Advice? Anything helps, I’m completely clueless.

Thank you so much in advance!

ADS/Trigger spamming/tapping to get an almost completely free shot and make little room for human error.

Although it is powerful with AR's for the dinks the ADS spamming/tapping is BEYOND broken with the Deagle.  Everyone has seen the Zayt clip and are trying to argue against that.  Like who can defend that?  The guy got 2 100+ deagles that took barely any skill AT ALL to hit.  The guy moved the crosshair over him and tapped *left trigger and right trigger* and got free dinks, and yes he aimed like that on purpose because he knows its much easier to hit a critical shot like that.  *Those shots he hit were more aim-assist than aim itself.*

447,hearth_custom,1548704587,akr5fp,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/akr5fp/6_ways_to_fix_the_rpg/,1,6 Ways to fix the RPG,"The RPG is an extremely strong weapon, and has been for quite some time. I think a change to the weapon is needed. I've come up with 6 different ways to do this (some are more extreme than others).

1. Splash Damage Falloff: As you know, when you shoot a rocket at a target, they will be damaged if they are anywhere within the blast radius, which is an extremely powerful effect. A potential solution is to introduce Splash Damage Falloff, which would mean that if you were right on the edge of the explosion, less damage would be dealt to you than if you were right in the middle. It could potentially deal 100% damage at the very middle, and 70% at the edge (or something along those lines). 


2. Nerf Damage: As of right now, the Purple RPG deals 116 damage and the Gold RPG deals 121. A simple nerf would be to simply nerf the damage to 100 for the Purple and 105 for the Gold. This is probably the mildest way to go about nerfing the RPG.


3. Increased Reload Time: As of right now, the Purple RPG has a reload time of 2.7 seconds and the Gold RPG takes 2.5 seconds. Another way to nerf the RPG (instead of nerfing damage) would be to increase the amount of reload time. I think that if it were increased by 1 second on each model (3.7 Purple, 3.5 Gold), that the constant flow of RPG spam could be disrupted. 


4. Revert Structure Damage Changes: Yet another different way RPG's could be changed is to revert their structure damage to what it was before Patch 4.4. In 4.4, the Rocket ammo maximum was changed to 12. To compensate for this, Epic changed the effectiveness of rockets on structures. Reverting this change would make them far less effective on blowing up structures.


5. Supply Drops Only: Another solution could be to make RPGs exclusive to Supply Drops. This way, they're much harder to access and won't be seen as often throughout the game.


6. Vault: This one is simple, but perhaps a bit extreme. This solution is simply to vault the RPG altogether.

I've been playing this game since it came out on PS4, and then switched to PC. I'm not a super sweaty player, nor do I really care enough about trying to break my skill gap to go pro. However I do play this game with a competitive mindset. This isn't that important, but I just wanted to point out that I've been here from the beginning, and have been here for all the metas. But this camping in a box is the worst one yet.

For starters, I don't agree with traps doing 150 damage. They should do 100, and even then it would still take 2 traps for a guarantee kill on someone. I'm sure we all have moments from time to time where we get killed by some random trap places by a person who isn't even in the game anymore. Most times we spot them before we enter a build or room, but other times it's just unexpected. But when it does happen, it really sucks.

Now here comes the talk about this dreadful turtle, aka camp in a box meta. I've always had this opinion about traps/turtling for a while, but this post just pushed me to the edge https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/akhsxr/yeah_i_follow_fortnite_competitive_too_bud/?st=JRGHQ5YM&amp;sh=21563f23.

It's really sad how this shameful playstyle is praised at this sub under the idea of ""gEt OuTpLaYeD"". No, he didn't get outplayed. You literally just sat in a box spamming turbo build, while praying that either you get 3rd partied before you run out of mats, or he manages to break in so you can place a trap. Again, it's really shameful. Why is this meta respected around here? This sub loves to see cool/nutty building tricks, but also loves to see ""OuTpLaYs"" like this. 

Assuming that the person has a good ping/server performance isn't shit, if you don't use exploits or any of the items deemed not competitive by this community then that person can virtually camp in his box until he runs out of mats. I've seen comments such as it's his fault for trying to break the same walls. I personally, never try to break into someone's 1x1 through their walls. I go from the top, exploit the roof phase, and drop in while immediately placing some stairs, but if they have two traps I'm screwed. But what else can I do? Leave them alone?

It's far too easy to just sit in a box spamming turbo build, then place a trap when they manage to get in. It's either that or spam the non competitive items that this sub complains about every day. I'm not talking about scrims and completive games where the goal is to win by any means necessary and everyone is turtling themselves. You rarely see people getting killed by traps in those type of games because it's getting a 0 kill win is worth more than the fun factor of going for high kill games or having a good fight with a player of similar or even better skill.


https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/akhsxr/yeah_i_follow_fortnite_competitive_too_bud/ef5lih1/

People downvoted this guy, but I honestly can't blame him. Yes, I dislike items such as RPGs boomboxes and dynamite as much as the next guy. But when I come across people who turtle and hide I wish I had as many of those items as I could possibly hold, even if it meant dying in the process.

Early game this is with low mats and any non shot gun weapon. Especially when it comes to competitive fortnite. I can almost bet half of most people’s deaths are early game when they don’t have a shotgun themselves.

I play on console and I’ve been grinding the pop up cups lately. I can get 20+ points pretty easily, especially in duos, but I noticed that i have trouble getting past mid game. I mostly land uncontested, mostly hamlet, so early game is not a problem. Surprisingly, i play late game very well. Using my game sense and good rotations i can win most of the time i get to late game, but that is the problem. I don’t get to late game very often. I mostly die to W key guys who just ram my turtle with a plane, or just mindlessly deagle my walls. I can keep up with pc building, but their aim is just on another level compared to mine. It seems as they hit every single pump jump shot. Does anyone have any good tips for surviving, while also getting a fair amount of kills per game? Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post.

Now recently the framerate on PS4 is awful. Trying to snipe someone when the screen freezes and they teleport is really no fun. Nevermind when we got to end circles and it was even worse. Instant build is broken AF so many walls ceilings and ramps just not placing at all. Honestly I know PC get better frames and a smoother running game but it just feels even harder to compete in the pop up cups currently. ",FortniteCompetitive
482,joshx18_,1548679530,akn34u,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/akn34u/fortnite_sensitivity_guide/,1,Fortnite Sensitivity Guide,"- Know your DPI
- Get your sensitivity 
       if your X and Y sensitivity is not the same yet then you're not doing it right
- Multiply your DPI to your sensitivity
       my DPI is 800 and I play with 0.05 ingame
- The result will be called your EDPI
       800 * 0.05 = 40 EDPI

Your EDPI for Fortnite should be in the range of 30-150. Anything lower than 30 is too low and does not benefit your build/aim. Anything higher than 150 may help you build quicker but your aim will suffer.
Of course there are people who play great with super high/super low sensitivity, but this is generally the best sensitivity range for the majority of players. 

Other tips:
- In Windows, check your mouse settings and turn off ""Enhance pointer precision"". This will remove mouse acceleration and will help with muscle memory.
- Set your ADS sensitivity to 1 so it is equal to your normal sensitivity. This is so that you don't mess up your muscle memory having a different aim/build sensitivity.
- Set your scoped sensitivity to 1. This is more of personal preference. Setting it to 1 will make it proportional to your sens, although some people like to tweak this sensitivity.

Hope this helps you in your mouse issues. Have a great aim!

I made this guide in a post because someone was asking for tips. Leave any improvements/suggestions in the comments so I know what to change!

Thing is it will also show a blue marker if you hit someone for like 100 damage if they have even 1 shield.

Watching replays can be frustrating when you realise the guy you shot had almost no shield and was weak.

It used to show a blue and white hit market which was better in my opinion. ",FortniteCompetitive

This seems to match the age restriction for the game. 

   
 

My question is for anyone who attended the 2018 event - how strict are they with this? My son is 11 but he could easily pass as 13. Obviously, like most kids his age, he doesn't have an ID so...?

   
 

My assumption is that as long as he looks close to 13 and has an accompanying adult, we should be fine. 

   
 

Thoughts?

Arena is a complete joke. In that game btw there were 35 people at the end of first zone. And the fact that u only need to make it to champs to be able to play in the World Cup qualifiers is unbelievable. There should 100% be more divisions in arena bc arena should be somewhere where u can practice for the World Cup. Yes there r scrims u can practice on but I am only a solo player and don’t play duos so the weeks when duo qualifiers r coming up the only games that r being played is duo and my only form a practice is playing arena or creative. Of corse more divisions would mean high queue times but there can be something else figured out to help such as scheduled games

Unfortunately, I'm a controller player so I cant do that scroll bind method, however cheap it may be. So is there anything I can do to improve or change my play? If so, how? Because playing on champs with this is ridiculous.

I  originally thought it was gimmicky too but after giving it a try, there was a significant difference from the first game when someone stormheld me.

Some pros have already switched including Monolith. If you can even adjust to the slight visual changes for deuteranope 3, you will most likely notice the storm immediately.

However this controller player is called a controller player for a reason. You define people in this game as controller or console. And people always just jump to ‘that guy is a console player’ just because he uses a controller. Well once again guess what? Its controller on pc, Wyggs is still the only person to qualify for a major through using a console. 

That being said im annoyed because now they are going to just watch this controller player and use this as an excuse to keep cross play competition in. EVEN THOUGH THEY QUALIFIED FROM A PC AND ALSO THE FACT THEY LITERALLY PLAY AT THE LAN, ON A PC!

Seeing new FOV methods where you drag up the task bar from the bottom. While this works yes, it is not the best way of doing so since you need to be windowed which can cause lag.

This is how to do it properly and in fullscreen (you will have black bars top and bottom)

First thing you need to do is create a custom resolution in your nvidia control panel (im not sure for amd sorry) by right clicking desktop, nvidia control panal, going to ""Change Resolution"" then ""Customise"". After this you NEED to go to ""Adjust desktop size and position."" Here we will change the scaling mode on your monitor to ""Aspect Ratio"" instead of ""Fullscreen"" as we did in the past for stretched.

After you create your custom res we need to go stretched old school..INI file!

Your Fortnite INI file will most likely be located at ""This PC/Local Disk C/Users/youruser/Appdata/Local/FortniteGame/Saved/Config

Put your new res in the lines;

""ResolutionSizeX=

ResolutionSizeY=

LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeX=

LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeY=""

!!!DO NOT FORGET to set your INI file as ""Read Only""!!!

These are all 12 values from scrolling the task bar up, the first one is the most horizontal fov and the last is the least.

Hope this can help my bois since the game is feeling very un-encouraging to play atm with lack of certain options \*COUGH fov COUGH\*

If you aren't, that poll is found [here](https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1112071234710323202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1112071234710323202&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Ffortnite%2Fover-100-000-fortnite-fans-vote-state-controversial-update-ninja-poll-502865). 

Those results indicated that 87% of players want siphon. Epic's claim is that 90% of players played less because of siphon being added to core modes. That's a nearly mirror image in results. There's no way one of these two isn't absolutely horribly wrong.

We are also disregarding the facts that Epic's test took place when Apex was still popular and when lack of a ranked playlist was forcing literal pro players to play against casuals, thus influencing the amount of people playing Fortnite during that time period.

Now, the first argument against this is always ""324,000 people is no where near Fortnite's total population so there are literal millions of uncounted voices"". 

Rebuttal: Not true. No research involving statistics ever samples an entire population to find statistically valid results. What about half? Lower. A quarter? Still way too high. 10%? Still way, way too high. 

Actually, you only need a sample size of [.0384%](http://iqsresearch.com/what-makes-a-statistically-valid-sample/) (yes, that's with removing the two decimal places to account for percentages) of a population if done correctly. 

Now, obviously Ninja took absolutely no measures to ensure he conducted a study with a valid sample. There is obviously bias one way or the other. For argument's sake (ignoring the fact that Ninja's audience is primarily casual and would if anything support Epic's claim if it wasn't a lie), let's assume it's biased **for** siphon. 

Let's also assume Fortnite's population during Epic's supposed testing period was 100 million people playing during those three weeks (probably too high at this point, but I'm being generous). 

Quoting the source, which is responsible for conducting statistical studies for major companies like Ford and Brown-Foreman:

&gt;What’s fascinating is if we wanted to widen our population count to, say 100 million people, you might think we have to ask 38,400 people. Not so. If you wanted to find out how many people out of 100 million would vote for vanilla, you only need to survey 385 people. It is still a statistically valid sample with just 385 people, and still able to gauge the ice cream preferences of one-third of the United States.

This means that, even despite the fact that Ninja didn't conduct a ""correct"" random sample, and even assuming Ninja's results are skewed in favor of siphon due to various factors and biases, Ninja sampled over **843 times**  the amount of people he would have had to if he had done a correct random sample (324,806/385).

I think a population sample size of 843 times the required amount is more than enough to account for any biases. Given that information, it would be plausible if Epic's results differed by even 50%. But their results are an almost exact mirror image of Ninja's. A company who would have every reason to promote their new playlist that directly ties into the biggest marketing event in the company's history in the form of the World Cup, by taking a feature they know people love and making it exclusive to that playlist. 

So I ask you Epic, why are you lying?",FortniteCompetitive

Its just facts. PC dominates all platforms. Whats the point marketing the World Cup in the sense ‘anyone’ can qualify when you literally get fucked over late game because of frames. Not to mention most people on here just shouting get a pc, just buy a pc, you will never qualify this and that. If this was a pc only competition, i would not have bothered attempted to play this game as competitively as i try to now. 

Here is what needs to happen. 

1 - This game should create seperate leagues. Console vs console, pc vs pc. Thats just plain obvious. It doesnt make sense to put everyone in the same bracket and say ‘everyone has a chance to qualify. In fortnites competitive history, 1 SOLE PLAYER has qualified for an event FROM CONSOLE. ONE. How many people play this game for one console player to qualify?

2 - limit competition. Im on console but i really do not care in saying id rather not have the opportunity to have a fair qualifying chance if they just dont give me it in the first place. Limit competition to only pc. This is literally what you are doing now so make it official. Your game isnt competitive when pc players are being fed points from any console player that has made it into qualifiers. 

If any console player makes it into worlds from their console, i guess ill eat my words. But other than that i dont see the point in being given an option to play comepetitively when im not playing true competitive.",FortniteCompetitive

3 months ago on Jan 26/27 2019 500 ANZ residents participated in the Fortnite Summer Smash event at the Australian Open. The top 100 that qualified and made it into the finals were told that the prize money was $1000 AUD and i happen to have made it through to the finals myself but have yet to receive any money along side about 20 other players possibly even more and when myself and the others reached out to all the competitive supports we heard back nothing and then i started to try and email epics different support where i was given the response that this was not and epic games sponsored tournament BUT i kept in contact with a couple of the blokes i met there and one of them who got paid was paid directly from Epic Games, inc (as seen below). It has been 3 months since the event finished 90 [DAYS]. there are around 20 people who have NOT been paid with a total earning of over $130,000 combined as shown in a quick list we put together for someone at epic to see but we have all been pretty much ignored upon trying to make contact, here is just a couple picture regarding whats happened as proof.

188,LordJev,1556424988,bi7hid,165,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bi7hid/epic_heres_a_brief_history_lesson_about_forcing/,2698,"Epic, here's a brief history lesson about forcing equivalence on PC and consoles- No hyperbole, no memes just the truth.","Most games, especially those with a competitive element, will balance console/mobile and pc separately. The worldcup features the largest esport payout in gaming history but , yet epic, you insist on forcing console players to play against pc players. Both platforms having separate perks and disadvantages that result in an unfair faceoff.

In the recent Competitive blog post, in short , you said you wanted viewers at home to feel as if they too could do that well as their favourite streamer because of the same visuals /settings etc. This is an impossible expectation. Since the majority of the player base is console based, they will never be able to relate to what happens in competitive events( because other than Wyggs placing well once, no console player has risen to elite status, literally because of hardware limitations). Not only do they not have even remotely comparable frames in endgame settings but the game literally looks different. Console players are stuck with shadows, high graphics among another settings they can not disable(recently allowed to disable motion blur). This is speaking as a pc player, with superior hardware to a console that finds playing the game with those settings on to be unbearable.

The major history lesson and a reminder about ""unfair advantages"". Remember when people complained that planes had an over tuned turret and many players on this sub would say this was not so? Remember how it was later revealed through video that biplane turrets on pc were a death laser but like trying to hit ants while on console? What did you do? Instead of making it just as bad on pc as it was on console, you did the reverse and made it the pc equivalent across all platforms.

Console and controller players have the ability to have a separate sensitivity for building/ editing and targeting. This does not exist on pc. Instead it is a one size fits all, with a generalization that ""pc players use their whole arms, deal with it"", i'm here to let you know that this generalization is bullshit, speaking explicitly as a ""wrist"" aimer. As a wrist aimer who does not have the same range of moition as full arm aimers, should I also have aim assist? The point is PC/mobile/console are all different and unique platforms and so a one size fits all should not be used particularly when it comes to FOV.

With all that out of the way, casual, above average and competitive out of the way, why should players sitting 1-2 feet away from their screen be forced to play at the same field of view (FOV) as someone sitting 10 feet away from their tv on a couch. There is a ridiculous mindset that PC players just want an ""unfair"" advantage over other platforms. Firstly this issue would not exist if the playforms were separated for arena/competitive settings. I play with my console friends all the time(well used to) and there was no issue, we won many games. However there is literally scientific evidence as to why a wider FOV is required for gamers sitting close to their screen (please note that some console players also play on monitors) e.g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blZUao2jTGA . I've played since week 8 of season 4 and having usied 1444x 1080 (stretched) since week 6 or so of season 5. I've never cared that 1079 x 1080 had a better FOV than me. I tried it, it actually felt nauseating and so stuck to aforementioned resolution since. That resolution provided enough vision and comfort for me to enjoy the game. 80 FOV is perfectly fine for console as you mentioned in the blog post but it is borderline inhumane to essentially tell people ""just adapt"" to inhibited basic biological functions. This is why FOV sliders exist, let people decide how much is enough on their own (within reason). We need to stand as a community, regardless of platform. Everyone deserves to have comfort playing this game. Motion sickness from feeling clusterphobic on 80FOV on pc is not a meme, it is a very real thing. Epic likes to run tests. Why not offer higher FOV in several increments and get feedback from the community to determine implementation or not, instead of just slamming the door shut at ""this is what you will play at"". Yes stretched seemed distorted compared to the norm but the recent FOV changer hacks that were on display showed that the FOV can be increased while keeping the same ratios. This is not a threat, speaking as a consumer who has spent real money on skins and a battle pass, I've never been interested in apex legends before, but with the recent stretched resolution removal and locked 80 FOV this nauseating feeling has felt so overwhelming that I've actually considered trying that game and being done with this game. I get the feeling that many others have probably started to have this feeling. Please rethink your stance on not only FOV but insisting on forming a forced balance equivalence for PC and console players.",FortniteCompetitive

(increase fov or add slider/add stretched resolutions back)," Over the past few days I have read post on this sub saying that players are getting motion sickness on such a low fov. Occasionally a headache or nausea will affect me after playing some fortnite. Adding and fov slider would mean that any player (on any platform) would be able to play on a setting (fov) that would make them comfortable. Just like color blind settings. For example, on detereonope 4 you are able to see into the storm better, color blind options are an OPTIONAL setting that does give an advantage. Same with aim assist, it is OPTIONAL and allows console/controller players better aim. Almost all good competitive games; cs:go etc. allow players to use settings that are comfortable for them (stretched resoulutions). STRETCHED: Removing stretched did make sense as it gave pc players an advantage. BUT, since any PC player is able to play on stretched, seperate console and pc in comp (arena pop-ups etc.) and then pc players wouldn't  have an advantage over console because there would be no console players in the games. 

I hope reading this changed your mind on fov/stretched, or gave more information on the current state of these topics and I hope that you too will fight to get things like these and pop-up settings back.",FortniteCompetitive

I noticed a bit of underlevel with the controller, as being with it seems that a keyboard and mouse is better and faster, but ive been playing for years with console controllers and the transition seems hard and time consuming

The 6 items are the sword, planes, drum gun, tac SMG, grappling hook, and bouncers. There will be an in-game event where players vote on one of these. A horrid cast of shit, with none of them being healthy for the game.

Based on from what I've seen of Twitter, drum gun is gonna win by a landslide. Casuals do not have a reason to care about game balance, and the feel/sound of the gun is just gonna put it leagues ahead for them. If Epic does not separate this from arena/tourneys (and so far they have not done a separate loot pool), the meta is about to become absolutely fucked once again by arguably the worst gun in Fortnite history. This will impact the Duo Week 4 Qualifiers (and depending on the timing of the event, possibly even tomorrow's solo finals).

Second, I shouldn’t even have to say anything about their reasoning behind taking out stretched and for not adding an FOV slider because it’s probably the stupidest thing anyone has ever heard. They don’t want to add “optional settings that provide players with a significant gameplay advantage” ??? I was just left scratching my head with this one. Also, what was the point of even creating the spectator client if stretched takes away from the “entertainment experience”...?

""Why don't the sweats just stop crying &amp; just adapt?' The real question here is, why don't the Little Timmy's &amp; Epic just ADAPT to what the game has become?

Why are we the ones that are forced to ADAPT, when we have given countless hours of our time to this game?

But technically, by choosing certain skins, people can get an advantage by lowering their visibility/visible hit box.

Therefore, if they are staying true to their word, being able to choose female skins vs skins that literally have neon lights on them (I’m looking at you, dark voyager) should not be a feature.

But obviously this is stupid as skins have slowly become a major part of Fortnite and at the end of the day, all Epic wants is our money and our attention span, not our happiness. This is just a thought on how their statements in the blog make little sense.",FortniteCompetitive

Comp players and casual players. Lets make that 3 actually. Casuals, Competitors and Pros. Yes, competitors and pros are different. Pros qualify for tournaments and win money. Competitors play arena and average at around 200 points or play pubs and have a K/D of about 2. Now the pros are a very small group and the biggest group is easily the casuals, but don't underestimate the size of the competitors. There's alot of people actually trying to get better at the game and learning builds and game strategies. The casuals might be greater in numbers, but if you tabulate the hours played for each group I think the difference between competitors and casuals would not be as sharp. The middle group is the group that makes fortnite an actual game which you can play, and not just an open world where people can run around and break trees shoot some bullets. The opinion of this middle group cannot lightly be cast aside by saying that they are not the majority. Any game needs half decent players present in the game to survive.

I have seen some people on this sub and a lot of people on other subs supporting the recent blogpost by saying ""Pros are so selfish and entitled they dont realise that this game doesnt belong to them and their opinion doesnt matter because they are in the minority"". 

There's a couple of issues with this statement. Firstly, anyone has the right to be angry if their demands are not met, especially considering the competitors had alot of options that were taken away from them right before the world cup. If they are mad about it, let them voice their opinions and call epic whatever they want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, and more importantly, people are acting like there is a conflict between the different groups of fortnite players. Why are casuals hating on pros so much? What harm have they done to you? If their demands are met, how will that harm you? The pros are not against the casual community. The casual community is a big reason the pros millionaires and can play in such high reward tournaments. No pro wants to make the game unplayable for casuals. 

&amp;#x200B;

An FOV slider will not damage the casual experience. Pros and Competitors dont even play pubs where most of the casuals reside. And if you're still scared, what is wrong with a slider in just arena mode? Yes the pros are whining for it. Why shouldn't they? They are being denied something that has no negative impacts and is still being kept from them. In the blog post epic said that they want pros to play the same game that the casuals play just in case the casuals are watching them. But you already have siphon/mats per kill/faster farming in comp modes. That already makes the game very very different. And plus scrims are a completely different type of game altogether that no casual can ever dream of in pubs. 20 extra degrees in the FOV will not so drastically change the viewing experience for casuals that they wont have any clue whats going on. Everyone asking for an FOV slider doesn't hate casuals and wants to pub stomp. They are just asking for everyone to get what they want. Unfortunately for some reason, some people have made it their mission to stop the pros from getting what they want, even if said people aren't affected by it in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

My request to every hating on the pros is : please don't. Its fine if you don't want the changes the pros want, altho i don't understand why you wouldn't. But don't hate on them for asking for something they want that won't even affect you.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR. FOV slider doesnt harm anyone. Pros have every right to whine. Anyone who opposes FOV slider just for the sake of denying the pros what they want has issues.

Obviously most people with braincells complains about this unnecessary change, hoping it will go back to normal. Finally, a few weeks later, in response to the complaints, the committee is going to announce something about what will happen with the blocks. Everyone hopes for the best, and in this announcement the committee says: ""Blocks will not be allowed as some runners may find them kind of uncomfortable so they will not be allowed at all"" 



Obviously the only players that wouldn't like the blocks are fucking casuals anyway who wouldn't have any chance at placing anywhere near.

I fell in love with the game and I’ve been playing ever since. For a while I was content playing on console, never really thought much of it. I got better and better as the comp scene started to grow. I would play in the pop-ups and do okay, played some scrims and all that but I never performed as well as I thought I would. In the back of my mind I knew I should invest in a PC, but at the same time I thought “if I can’t even put together a decent performance on console, is it really worth my money to buy a PC and potentially do no better?” I stuck with it for a while, grinding and trying to improve. That is always what kept me playing, the fact that even after thousands of hours played I could still learn things and get better. Then Arena came around. I started grinding, and pretty quickly got to 200-250 points. Then I bottomed out. For the past 2 weeks or so I would get up to 275 points, then drop back to 250. I couldn’t get anywhere, and I started to think maybe I was finally as good as I was gonna get and it wasn’t worth my time anymore. Then on a whim I ordered a PC. I had the money the whole time but never truly knew what I was missing. It got here on Wednesday, I set it up and started playing. I got Champions that night. I haven’t had that much fun playing Fortnite in forever. I realized that I was right- I was as good as I was gonna get- on console. The past three nights I’ve stayed up way too late playing and genuinely having fun, because that sense of improvement is back. Everything is so much smoother, it looks better, it feels better. It made the game enjoyable again. Can’t wait to play in the qualifiers tomorrow. 


This is all disregarding the issues with the game right now, there is still work to be done and if the game continues down this path then it may not be worth your money. If they really want to kill the game and seriously capped PC FPS at 60, I would be so upset that I just poured so much money into a PC. (I don’t think they would go that far but honestly who knows anymore.)


That being said, if you’re on the fence about making the switch and you have the money but can’t decide if it’s worth it, IT IS. The second you play your first game you will wonder why you waited so long.

1. FOV

If your argument for no FOV slider is because higher FOV causes motion sickness then you have NO argument.

Having a slider will let the person playing from their couch on a tv remain at 80 while allowing others to change.

You cannot group ALL players into one group of “higher FOV causes sickness.” Not everybody’s body works the same way. What if 80 FOV gives me more motion sickness than 100?

2. DATA

As a Data Analyst I appreciate putting some numbers behind your decisions but simply stating abstract percentages does not tell a story.

How is this data being collected? Is it raw player count numbers? Is it surveys of people telling you they don’t like siphon? What audience is being surveyed and is it a big enough sample size?


3. Siphon/Materials

If casual players don’t have a chance and do not like siphon, enable it as an option to be enabled or disabled when queuing for a public match. Set the default to “no siphon.” 

If your solution to playing siphon is to “play arena” you will be willingly decreasing your average play time because arena games burn people out far quicker than public matches yet public matches are not enjoyable anymore to average-good players.

But Epic's logic is not unsound: 

1. They see no competition on the horizon from any game that has building as a central mechanic. 

2. Their players have played religiously for 2 years. 

3. When a shooting title (like Apex) comes out, they can deploy the changes. The players will try out the new game, then come back because ""finally Epic listens to their community and the game is fun again!""

&gt;**Stretched Resolution and Field of View (FOV)**

&gt;The current default FOV of 80 is a tradeoff to accommodate:

&gt;Varied engagement ranges, favoring a low FOV and thus a closer view of enemies.


A higher FOV is better for close-range fights and a lower fov is better for long range fights. Competitive matches have much more close range fights than casual matches, so naturally competitive players would prefer a higher fov and casual players might prefer a lower fov. This is a problem that could be fixed by adding an FOV-slider.


&gt;Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen. The further a player’s head moves from the center of the in-game field of view, the more negative the reaction.


Some people get motion-sickness while playing on a high FOV, most people don't. This is a problem that could be fixed by adding an FOV-slider.


&gt;Minimizing jarring transitions when aiming down sights.

I'm guessing this means that if you were playing on a higher FOV in this version of the game, when you ads it would decrease your FOV to the same FOV that it would have been decreased to if you were playing on native. This problem could be fixed by increasing the FOV of adsing proportionally to the FOV. (For example 80° FOV decreases to 70° when you ads, so when you play on 90° FOV it should decrease to around 80° when you ads, not 70°.)

&gt;Visual fidelity.


I don't see how this would be a problem if it was developed properly, as can be seen in plenty of other games which have no problem with having an FOV slider.



&gt;Performance.


A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bg6b3g/fortnite_at_different_fovs/) made by DrSpiral a few days ago is evidence that higher FOV doesn't have an effect on fps, as his fps didn't change at all going from native to 135° FOV. This is not definite evidence as Epic probably has more information about it than we do, but it does suggest that higher FOV has little to no effect on performance.",FortniteCompetitive

Many users here are under the impression that they don't actually mean what they say. I will take the time to make this as simple as possible for those who are still unsure of how this game will continue to develop, just incase it hasn't been clear yet. You can argue with me about whether it is the best way to go about things, but these are simple facts based off Epics actions and words.

1. Competitive fortnite will be a mix between all platforms. Lobbies will be mixed for all events. Competitive decisions will be made with this in mind, in order to not widen the advantages that PC players already have. 
2. Competitive fortnite will be standardized to ensure a more fair gameplay across all platforms and to have a more consistent viewer experience. Stretched was taking away for this reason. The expectation of a FOV slider is unrealistic at this point. If a FOV slider ever has a chance to make it into this game, there will need to be major performance updates on console before this would even be considered.
3. Normal game modes will always cater to casuals, and arena will follow suit to a degree. There will always be a way for less mechanically skilled players to succeed, whether that is a baller, a boombox, or whatever the flavor of the month is. There will always be a way for a less skilled player to out place you, whether you think it is fair or not. One day, ballers will be removed but only to be quickly replaced with a different means to play passively. 
4. Content will continue to be pumped out at the insane rate it is now. We will have new weapons, vehicles, items, and ...... you guessed it.... new bugs to deal with for the rest of this game's life. This is how they claim to keep the player base healthy and it has been working thus far, so they will continue to do so. 

If you absolutely can not deal with any of these facts, you should stop wasting your time with this game. This is how Epic has always went about their development process and this is how it will continue. The constant spamming and crying out for stretched res, or baller vaults, or a fov slider is not only unnecessary but unrealistic. Epic has vowed to be more active in the community so let's please give them ideas and recommendations that follow suit with their development plan instead of shouting the same recommendations that have 0 chance of making it into the game.

But for real tho, good players shouldn’t find this a problem, as they would be good enough to take no damage in fights. Though the siphon mechanic should be implemented to duos, squads and larger team LTM since you’re fighting more players at the same time, it is harder to keep your health and shields up even if you are really good.

Hello  everyone! We are a sports analytics firm that has branched into  esports. We have been digging though the World Cup replay data and ended  up creating tree graphs to visualize the games.

Hopefully this is  all clear from the graphs but they are directed trees, edges point from  left to right, from the killed to the killer. If the storm, falling,  etc. kills a player and no player was credited the kill then there are  multiple trees. Y axis is game time from when the battle bus appears. X  axis doesn't mean anything.

We hope you  like these but would also like feedback on what we could do better or  any ideas to use them other than cool pictures. We are planning to post  more players.

In case you don't know what it is, it's basically applying a primary and secondary build bind so that you have one to initiate the edit, and another to confirm it. An hour of just editing in courses and in playground I noticed two things:  


\-Editing speed increased significantly (about 10-30% faster).  
\-More fluid and smooth editing (less fumbling due to rapidly pressing a button).  


At first it felt awkward due to the lack of muscle memory and ""feel"" of it all, but after an hour it felt somewhat normal. In due time, it'll feel natural. The trick to doing this is to use two keys that are close to each other. I personally used 'v' as my edit key before, now I use 'v' and 'c'. I use my thumb to press both. If you use 'F', considering using 'G'. Try it out for yourself, I'm quite satisfied with my findings.",FortniteCompetitive

After much consideration, we have decided to implement the highly-requested FOV slider for Fortnite: Battle Royale in the upcoming 8.60 patch. This will allow users to adjust their FOV from a minimum value of 80 to a maximum value of 100.

However, we realise that in order to maintain a fair and balanced playing environment for all players, the advantages gained from increasing FOV must be offset with counter-acting disadvantages.

For this reason, each 5 point increase in FOV will result in the limitation of other settings available to the user. These limitations are as follows:

80 - All setting available.

85 - Sprint by default disabled.

90 - Frame rate locked to 60 FPS.

95 - Turbo-building disabled.

100 - Keybinds locked to default settings.

Additionally, in order to sustain the viability of alternative playstyles following this FOV buff, the 8.60 patch will increase Baller health to 600.

We are confident these changes will serve to futher increase competitive integrity as we progress with the Fortnite World Cup qualifiers over the coming weeks!",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;nbsp;

more proof, a video example here of the performance being identical in a heavy scene overlooking tilted towers no matter if the multithreaded rendering is enabled or disabled: ------&gt;  https://streamable.com/s0oyn

&amp;nbsp;

as you can see in the video, I turn it on and off while overlooking tilted, the fps stays identical, and before we got multithreaded rendering/RHI in patch 8.30 standing at this same spot overlooking tilted.
my fps would always without exceptions drop to 60-90 depending on if other players were nearby or not, as you can see in the video it now stays close to 120 constantly no matter if the RHI is on or off,
cpu usage is also the same in task manager but this is not shown in the video.


&amp;nbsp;


even more proof that RHI thread is always being used even if locked in the games config file:

&amp;nbsp;

I tried closing the game, setting the ""bAllowMultithreadedRendering=True""  variable to ""bAllowMultithreadedRendering=False"" in GameUserSettings.ini,
located in ""C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient"" and then changed the properties of the file to Read-Only to be sure, 
loaded up the game and checked options menu ingame, it was set to Off, I went to the same spot overlooking tilted, and the fps was still the same,
close to 120 instead of dropping down to 60-90 like before we had RHI thread being used in the game.

&amp;nbsp;



So from this I feel pretty safe to conclude RHI thread is still always being used no matter what the user sets the game to, and this is several updates later after we supposedly should be able to turn it off with ""-norhithread"" commandline and so on,now we even have ingame option and still not working... the stutters has made the game unplayable for me on my quadcore i5 cpu the past month now, ever since the first small ~80 mb size minipatch deployed shortly after 8.30 to adress dualcore cpu performance, i'm getting regular stutters in 1 minute intervals that drop my fps from 120 to 50 on my quadcore cpu , but that's a different story I guess....anyway it would atleast be nice being able to turn RHI/multithreaded rendering off even if it means lower fps in heavy scenes, if thats what it takes to remove the stutters and heavy hitching every 1 minute on the dot in intervals then i'll take it...

I think that the new Sound Visualizer settings are stupid. Now you are able to use the Sound wheel, as well as the normal sound in game, regardless of platform at the same time. Coming from the perspective of a competitive player with hearing loss, I think this makes the game very unfair for hearing impaired players to compete with others. The sound wheel originally balanced the game for people with hearing loss because they could still ""hear"" things just as well as others. With the new update players with hearing loss now are at a larger disadvantage. Players now have a competitive advantage because they can use both. Does anyone else agree with this? What do you think about it coming from the perspective of a hearing person?",FortniteCompetitive

Seeing as we’re on the topic of the tac shotgun(as it’s one of the top posts on this sub), would allowing pump-tac make it viable again?

I mean it probably wouldn’t be viable in late game arena but almost every other situation especially pubs it would be at least worth picking up.

Btw when I say “again” in the title, I’m referring to how it was used a lot in season 2.",FortniteCompetitive

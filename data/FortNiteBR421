I agree that running around in pubg was annoying as fuck and made that particular royal game not for me.  H1z1 seemed to hit the sweet spot for awhile allowing people to drop in grab guns and get dirty, although with recent patches the gun fights became who could spam faster.  I enjoyed the game when it was focused on smart *pop *pop shots rather than let's spray and pray.  Fortnite has a very low-risk feel and is something that doesn't really bother you if you die early on....the games move quick and the fights are fun.  However, for this game to draw me in, I believe having weapon bloom and all the weapon qualities effects the game competitively.  Allowing someone to shoot further/straighter/and have more damage just because they landed somewhere better is a little unappealing to me.  What do you guys think? ",FortNiteBR

I've come in second a few times and usually finish in the top ten, but I cannot figure out how to actually win. 

The last game I played I had full health and armor and was sneaking around until I found the last other person, so I started shooting at him with my epic assault rifle. I shot him pretty 6 or 7 times, and I swear to god he turned around and killed me in 2 or 3 shots. What the fuck? I do pretty well in most FPS games I play, but I just seem to get fucking steam rolled consistently in Fortnite. Same with my other friends I've been playing with. One is the best Call of Duty player I've played with yet he gets wrecked as well. 

Even with full health and armor it feels like it takes a couple shots for me to die but I have to fucking lob bullets into an enemy for them to drop. It's gotten to the point where I try not to engage anyone because it feels like I have a 1 in 10 chance of actually winning, even if I get the drop on them.

Does anyone have any tips? I see people talking about going on 20+ kill streaks and I can't even fucking fathom that in this game. Most I've gotten in a game is like 5 or 6. I crouch down and go for headshots but I still can't seem to do it. I just want to come in 1st for once, Jesus.",FortNiteBR

7,SoulH3R0,1510784302,7d7q9s,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7d7q9s/state_of_the_game_discussion/,4,State of the game (discussion),"I've been playing this game for some time now, and in that time I've been able to see a huge 'shift' in the game flow (or meta), and honestly I feel like it's gearing away from fast paced action, to more slower pace gameplay.

* For starters, there is a higher drop rate for shields (blue pots), this means you are more likely going to run into opponents that have one or even two. Not only could you not tell whether or not someone has one unless you shoot them, but it gives you the ultimatum to choose ""do I save my shield for later in the game, or fight (and risk not being able to refill going into late game vs opponents that will gave one)"". The other scenario being you don't have a shield, and you are worried about running in with a shotgun, so it forces you to wait the opponent out so you get a couple free shot off. It feels like every other battle I run into, my opponent has a shield. So it takes away from the ""Run&amp;Gun"" play style that I personally enjoy the most. 

* Secondly, the release of bush consumables. I can't lie, I had my hilarious moments with it upon release, but again it promotes a slower style of gameplay, requiring you to sit around and camp.

* My final point is on the nerf of shotgun. Yes they were definitely overpower, and I do miss the times where I could easily 1vs4 with the red shotgun, or one shot someone with the pump from 20+feet. But it does seem like they went a little overboard on the ""Big Red"", the gun now hits single digit damage from up close sometimes, and feels really inconsistent now.

Although this is my take on the state of the game, I feel like it's moving away from the fast paced, pick up a gun, and gogogo that I know &amp; love about Fortnite, and it's turning in to slower version, that makes you cautious about more than it has to. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts, and whether anything has to be addressed! ",FortNiteBR

So today I played a few matches of FBR and noticed something very aggravating, most of the time I died in 1v1s, but from all of those today I had the major advantage and full health, all were lost    
I had a guy 2 meters in front of me, I whipped out my pistol because of the challenge (3 pistol frags) and thought I'd unload the whole mag onto him, I ducked out of cover, aimed for his head and started shooting, from about 10 shots 5 went around his head and the others maybe into his head or his upper body, he turns around frantically shoots 2 times and I'm dead    
or the time I was in a barn house, was jumping on the small roof to get a look and was getting shot at from behind, I run back into the house and see him running from cover to cover, so I reposition myself in another room with windows to his last position (I have a blue scoped assault rifle) I see him running towards the house, I stand up and open fire, after about 6 shots he realizes where I am and starts shooting back, I hit him again and again, he shoots and breaks the windowed wall, he ducks and weaves and keeps on shooting I track him as best as I can slowly letting off every shot not to spam so the recoil is low, he jumps around shoots in my general direction and I go down    
I'm really frustrated with those situations, situations where I should clearly come out a victor because I have a massive advantage and then the games fucks me over with it's random hit registration and recoil    
then I watch the Twitch compilations on YouTube where people hit one random shot after the other and I think to myself, is this really what the Devs have in mind? total RNG in a game where you have to be accurate? I had some really random kills aswell already, but most of the time the RNG doesn't seem to be on my side at all    
right now I play more Fortnite than PUBG because I like the building and fast gameplay but those RNG moments are slowly pushing me back to PUBG where a hit will always be a hit",FortNiteBR

The reason I say xbox is because, obviously one I play on Xbox but two, players on Xbox are definitely worse than ps4 or pc. By the time the circle closes the first time, over half the players are dead. 
That means by the time you and 2 other people should be in the circle, it should be tiny.
Instead I find myself in top 10 situations and the circle has only shrank once or twice leaving a massive open space for someone to just sit in a bush. I have been killed every single game since the Bush update by someone sitting in a bush. As I type this the guy who killed me last is still sitting in the Bush has not moved in 10 minutes except left or right to keep from being kicked. It takes so much fun away from this game for me because now I constantly have to worry about a fucking bush man, it sucks. 

at least make it so when you shoot the damn thing goes away....

I guess rant over.

There's a new trend thats turning epidemic of people team killing there own players for loot and sometimes it seems for fun! 

Rather than let there random newcomer play alongside them or not select the fill function pre game, some a lot of players seem to take the route of shooting there teammates in there back when there not expecting it. This is especially frustrating in a game type like BR as it ends your game. 

This evenings night of gaming I've had it all and no less than 5 of the 7 games I've played in at some point I've been killed by my own player intentionally. These are some of my recent experiences of team killing:

- Within the first 2 minutes of the game after the first house loot grab, my 3 team mates ruthlessly opened up on me in a 3 bed semi detached kitchen outside of Tomato town.

- I played with these 3 guys for nearly 15 minutes, survived scrapes together, shared ammo even gave them shield potions. Last 19 people left in the game, i had just carried two of them through a dodgy fight in retail row which ended in me killing 2 enemy and reviving two of them, what do they do whilst im keeping watch to repay me, he shoots me in the back of the head with a sniper rifle.

- i just dropped into a game, decided to go far away from my team mates after recent painful experiences. Play basically solo, managed to survive a one sided fight by bugging out through a building, Im doing the home improvement shuffle across the open ground building stairs and walls left right and centre to get away from enemy fire, then alas, more shots coming at me from the right, Damn. I quickly dig in, building myself a small ish fort for protection from all sides, i get into a vantage position to take stock of the situation and identify where my most immediate threat was coming from the squad behind me or the squad to my right. which is when i realise im truly fucked, because of course the second squad firing at me where my team mates, in fact not only were they shooting me but they could definitely see the enemy team shooting me as well and were completely ignoring them. Unsurprisingly i didn't survive the situation, funnily enough neither did any of my rogue team mates a they were quickly taken care of by the squad that weren't shooting at each other. 

- The last one didn't even make sense, they chased me right of the bat and i knew why all three of them were coming from me. i ran 4-5 Km with them relentlessly chasing me, always about 0.5km away. then i got to the edge of the map, they quickly gained on me. The circle had started to come in at this point, i built some stairs and using my AR and grenades i held them at the edge of that cliff until the circle was nearly upon us, and my ammo was all but gone. At which point i threw myself off the cliff, to deny them the satisfaction of killing me and the possession of my loot. none of the bastards made until the circle and the storm took all three of them. 

These trolls must be stopped, this problem kills the game for me more that the cheaters did. EPIC something needs to be done!!!! 

Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I was thinking of maybe giving the victim of the team kill the option to kill his squad mate who just killed him. Call it the retribution button or something, this gives the victim the choice to let the player keep playing. Sometimes fights get hectic and accidents happen with stray shots and grenades gone wrong, but if the victim feels hard done by or intentionally betrayed for loot etc than they can get revenge.

But if it spawned with 2 magazines of ammo I could see it being more viable. Multiple times I've killed 1 person, it take the full 25 shots, but then only have 12 more shots and then not really be able to kill the next person. Obviously this only is a solution to really early game fights (which honestly I feel is the only use for SMG, they don't have a place in endgame right now.)

The biggest contrast here being that an AR with 30 rounds, or a Shotty that has 15 rounds upon landing, can allow you to fight through multiple people before running out of ammo, the SMG right now just doesn't really allow for that.

EDIT: I thought of another suggestion:  maybe half the RPM speed and increase damage, less bullets needed but still more damage. Like if it shot as fast as the 9M pistol can shoot with that damage you might fix some issues.",FortNiteBR

We land at salty springs and we all go around looting in different buildings until I hear gunshots coming from the house next door. I run out to help my teammate when we get jumped by a full squad . 1 teammate gets killed and the other 2 get downed while I'm still alive and I proceed to kill the rest of the enemies in a 1v3 scenario. 

I survived with 18 health left thanks to lucky headshots and the fact that I had a purple scar... i pick my two remaining teammates up and even drop one of my two medkits for one of them to use and while I start healing they both shoot me at once with shotguns and kill me. They pick up my scar and sniper and start to teabag me. 

I'm already angry as hell as I report them both but THEN, I get a friend request from one of them and a party invite right after (PSN). When I joined I was expecting some sort of apology or something but instead they are laughing uncontrollably calling me a scrub and stupid and stuff. Like what the hell? 

I told them to go ahead and laugh it up, that I reported them for that but they just laughed harder and said it's not like it'll ever matter. ??? 

I don't know why I wrote this. I'm just jaded so hard right now. I wouldn't even be this mad if this wasn't the same exact scenario that I see happen. Every 1/4 squad fill matches I try to play.

I know people have said ""It will just make the game toxic"" etc etc, yes in a sense it will. Everybody can say they have experienced some type of trash talk, trolling, racism etc.. This happens in all online games, call of duty for example is known for trash talkers. That is why a simple resolution comes in place called a 'Mute chat' button

There should be an option to mute proximity chat, maybe in the settings? Or somewhere easily accessible like the inventory screen, I don't know. But  its just an easy way of countering the abuse, mute &amp; report :)  This also means muting the proximity chat can allow you to just hear your squad chat when in squads/duos. 

I know this is definitely a debatable topic &amp; I appreciate if people don't get mad because I'm asking lol, its just my opinion &amp; if you don't agree say why below :)!

Edit #3; Sorry for such a long post, but it also seems minimizing the game makes it use more CPU? that has to be a bug. with the game open it uses 13% cpu on the menu but when i minimize it, it shoots up to using 80-100%, still on the menu.

**Make all team damage reflect on the player that dealt the damage instead of the player that is hit.**

Tactical players still get the fear of shooting through their teammates in combat with penalty. Exploiters can not use random teammates as shields to shoot through/around them without concern. Team killing would instantly stop overnight because any team damage would just kill themselves.

If ""people would just intentionally jump in front of your shots"" became a major concern just make the reflect damage do 50% or less of the actual bullet damage to prevent this being abused. No grenade or rocket reflect damage if necessary. If someone tries to jump into your fire you just simply stop shooting and avoid them for the remainder of the match. Problem solved.

Many years ago, maybe even centuries ago, 5 members of an alien race came into contact with Earth. They discovered a game called Battle Grounds - The creator of which is still unknown to this day, but they found it amazing. They lost interest in harvesting our planet for resources and indulged them selves in countless online battles. They told their home planet of the game, which brought many more of them to Earth. They didn't land, they just hovered above, hidden from view, connecting to peoples WIFI and broadcasting their gameplay back to their home planet for all those who could not afford the trip to Earth.


While the aliens loved playing the game, they simply weren’t use to this form of entertainment, and would lose to the humans in nearly every game they played. As time passed, more and more of their people grew tired of losing to the humans and became more and more interested in watching them fight each other. This caused distress for the original 5 aliens who discovered Earth and the Battle Grounds game, as they had been funding their life styles by selling the game to their home planet through G2A referral links. The 5 aliens, no longer able to make money using their G2A referral links, came together to figure out a solution… with their remaining money put together, they formed V-Tech.


V-Tech held a grand tournament, the likes of which had never been seen, calling all the greatest players to battle it out online for ever living glory and some several million dollars.  For the people of Earth, this was what appeared to be the greatest esports event of all time. The tournament brought the best of the best, with some 800 players making it to the Semi-Final. The semi final was a Solo Only match, the winners from which would team together to form the very final match, a small Squad vs Squad match to be held at the V-Tech head quarters.


The semi finale matches ended, with the 8 winners being called the best of the best. Their gametags were: Hawk, Banshee, Wildcat, Jonesy, Spitfire, Ramirez, Headhunter and Renegade.


The day of the final match came, 10s thousands of people showed up to see off the winning contestants. People cheered people cried, people screamed in excitement as the contestants climbed the steps of the V-Tech private jet. The commotion and excitement was so much so, that no one seemed to even notice that the V-Tech jet looked like no other plane seen before. As the jet took off, the alien crafts that had remained unseen, hovering just within WIFI range, turned off their cloaking devices. A thunderous crack was heard across the world, then a rumbling. Beams of darkness shot down from the now un-cloaked alien crafts, crashing through the Earth's crust. Within minutes the entire earth was covered in a pinkish-purple “storm”, killing everyone that lived. The only living things to survive, oddly enough.. were butterflies and bees..


On board the “jet”, the 8 contestants, strapped tightly into their seats, were quickly injected with an anesthetic. In their anesthetized state, they were hurriedly flew to the alien's mother-ship, where they had their consciousness extracted and fed it into a computer. From there they modified their memories and downloaded the consciousnesses into advanced, cybernetic, bio-mechanical bodies, created for the sole purpose of fighting.

When I say I want to talk about prices I'm not complaining that they don't give us more free stuff because what they already give us is above and beyond and, in fact, I do not mind one bit giving money to them for cosmetic items.  This is a game I would have paid $60 for if it hadn't been free so it only makes sense that we be willing to pay for additional items in game.

What I want to say is that I want to give them money for these items but the price points that they're currently at make no sense and, as such, I will never buy anything.  It's $60 for 7500 points.  A pickaxe costs 1500 points.  That's 5 pickaxes, effectively, for the price of a game.  And they're putting out some cool pickaxes that I want to buy but I can't justify buying them if it costs me $12 per, especially since I would want to switch between them.  Same thing for costumes and gliders, though they're slightly less expensive each.  Half of the items for costumes barely make a noticeable difference on your character as it is anyway.  If I wanted a different color outfit I might spend a dollar for such a small difference, but not $4. You get entire songs in games like Rock Band for less than that and those are things that you can play over and over again.  You hardly ever even see glider modifications and cosmetic changes, while cool to have, don't really make anyone get more enjoyment from the game.  

Again I'm not saying that I want anything for free but I think that a small change would make me much more inclined to purchase these items.  I want to give them money to support them because they're awesome and they've made a great game but I can buy a month of Netflix in 4K for unlimited devices for the price of a pickaxe and I don't really see how those two things are the same value.

Obviously everyone is in a different situation, financially, and people have different preferences regarding how important cosmetics are to them. Right now I feel like the prices alienate those people that may not be as well off as streamers, youtubers, or people with wellpaying jobs and alienate those people that find cosmetics cool but not necessary.  I think that a small drop, while not netting them as much per buy, could make these items accessible to new demographics and, therefore, increase the number of purchases and overall profit, as well as making the customers happier.  Win, win.

We need to make one more change to **controller** sensitivity changes in V.1.9. (Mouse and keyboard players are not affected.)

The new scoped sensitivity and ADS sensitivity settings will allow players much more control than before, offering a wider range altogether. However, **your scoped and ADS sensitivity settings will be affected**. Due to the nature of the change, there was no easy way to convert existing settings. 

We know how important sensitivity preferences are to you and we are sorry for the upcoming adjustment. As soon as patch V.1.9 is live, sensitivity will feel different and we encourage you to change your settings to find what’s comfortable for you.

TL;DR: How have you managed to keep interest in this game once you've grown comfortable enough with winning first place that it's not quire as exciting as it used to be?

Details:

I've been playing FortNite Battle Royale almost since it released.  I enjoyed the game enough that I bought the single player version as well, and I've been playing it on the side.  It's fun, but also a bit tedious.  It does allow you to earn V-Bucks however.

I've gotten good enough at Battle Royale that I can win regularly such that it no longer comes as a surprise.  It's great to win, but no longer freak-out great like my first few wins were.  I'm comfortable with the end-game now.

Moving forward, I see FortNite BR becoming something I play when I'm bored as opposed to something I love to play and want to play all the time, and I find that a bit sad.  I love the PvP, but it has to have an end-game reward, something that keeps me returning so I can grind and receive it.

I *thought* that the Season Shop items would fix the problem, and that after grinding enough to reach the milestones I would be rewarded.  Lets just say I was hugely disappointed when it was unveiled and everything had to be purchased for about the same amount of money you would purchase the regular shop items.  It kind of took the enjoyment out of the game for me.

Like I mentioned above, I own the base game.  I currently have enough V-bucks set aside to buy some cosmetic BR items.  However, I can't bring myself to spend V-bucks that it took weeks to grind on a skin that, frankly, isn't that different from most of the random skins you get upon loading in normally.  If they had slashed the price of the seasonal items, that might have been enough, but it still would have been a bit disappointing.

If any of you are in a similar situation, or have been in the past, how have you managed to stay engaged/interested in BR?  I'm on the verge of telling FortNite that it's about time for me to start seeing other games, and that makes me a bit sad.

-Shit utilities (Bush, Shield, Ect.)
Note- by this i mean No point in have a bush, when the PvP aspect of the game is still unfinished)

Epic Games youre fucking up big time by even adding new things into the game when you still havent fixed any bugs/glitches with the game. 

Couple of bugs

-Bush disappers even if in circle and not getting shot at.

-Again Laggy servers

-Sniper Scope Sensitivity

-Report button (Console) Note- What i mean is that its there for comfort not for actually reporting. (Really think reporting will get someone punished well youre wrong.)

-The shooting mechanism

Ive put $80 into this game so far (Founders pack and vbucks) in hopes of it getting better, and at this point im not wasting anymore money on a shit company. Im not saying me not spending money isnt gonna make a diffrenece but overtime this company will feel it when most of its fanbase leaves due to the game never improving. 

This is my farewell to fortnite. Atleast until they actually fix the game. in the meantime guess ill be playing pubg until it comes out on console.

I am okay with a little RNG on spawns in regards to weapons and supplies of course. However, someone shouldn't land in a warehouse alone and come out with nothing. It makes for an unfun experience.

I think everyone should have a chance to get a weapon unless they land next to someone and race for the same gun. 

I love the battle royale format but am not a fan of useless spawns and would like it to be slightly less RNG.


Edit: Just to be clear it's mainly because we already have Ammo crates in the game and we can farm our own resources. So they do nothing but take up a spot that could have a weapon or healing supplies.",FortNiteBR

I've been thinking about this for a bit and while unable to come to a definitive answer I definitely have some ideas.

My intention is to find the best strategy for getting to a particular location as fast as possible. This is based on:

- Bus route
- Landing location

Obviously I'm ignoring some things like location of other players but feel free to address those in the comments, as well as any other strategies!

https://imgur.com/5BATxWs

First of all, here is a paint drawing of my strats. red X is where you want to land. Around this is the float range, which has a radius equal to the distance you can travel while floating to the floor near that area. Meaning if you start gliding at the edge of the float radius, you will land exactly on the red X. Things like terrain height matter here, and would make the float range non-circular, but I'm ignoring that for now.

Starting floating at the edge of the circle is better. This is because you can always reach the edge of the circle quicker, and if you can start your float sooner, you will land sooner.

Next up is the dive line. This is for getting to the edge of the float circle. The shortest distance between the two will be a straight line perpendicular (90 degrees) to the bus route. BUT the bus moves. So you incur a time penalty for staying on too long, and a distance penalty if you get off too early. This could be represented as minimizing time taken with respect to the angles which the diveline and float line take.



**TL;DR:**

take perpendicular angle (ish) from bus, then enter your glider at edge of float range closest to the bus route.

One thing I find strange though...

Building seems like a terrible idea?
I understand it gives you cover, but it just SCREAM ""I'm here!""

Often i start shooting at a player, and they start building walls. Then I just lob explosives or wait for them to peak and it's an easy kill.

I especially notice it in the final 5.
I might come over the ridge, and the last few people all have built small shelters and are shooting at each other.
Like I'll be the only one whose presence everyone isn't aware

A few people mentioned in another thread that it would be fun tracking footprints in a snow level.  I assume this would be a nightmare to code for but I thought the idea was an interesting one.  Do you think Epic should figure out a way to add tracking into the game?

As for a weapon/gadget idea, I think a one use, hit scan, silenced sniper rifle that plants a bug on the hit enemy might be interesting.  If you're hit with the tracking bug, you can't notice.  The only way to know if you have a bug on you would be to open up your inventory and look off in the bottom right hand corner where a small symbol indicates you're hit.

If you're bugged, you show up on the enemies map.  That way, both the bugged player and the player who planted the bug could set up interesting ambushes for the other player/duo/squad.

I would really like it if there were randomly spawned ""doomsday bunkers"" it would only be accessible by finding a randomly spawned hatch on the ground that you would break and could go inside. The bunkers would be totally random in where they spawn and would actually be really small like how you imagine a bunker being. It would have shelves with canned food, a bed and maybe a table. But each bunker would 1 gold item of any kind OR 2 purple items ( + a few other small things bandages, maybe a green item or two etc. ) The bunker would be in the ground with one entrance making it extremely easy to ambush if you're seen going into it, the hatch would be metal with 2000 health, and once broken a loud alarm would go off as if the hatch's security system is going off. 

I said that the hatch would be 100% random and it would be, but if you're relatively close to a bunker there would be pipes coming out of the ground nearby ( so people in the bunker can get air ) this would tell players that a hatch is nearby.

You can see someone build up to grab a chest on the 2nd floor of a dilapidated house, and rush to that house without being seen, but if you move an inch, or press reload, the enemy is going to know he's not alone.

My question to you is this.  Why is this in the game?  Why can't players use stealth as a viable offensive tactic?  If Epic was worried about it becoming too OP, they could nerf it with slowing the speed of crouch walk.

What is your opinion on this issue and how do you think Epic is going to handle it going forward?

The App was created 3 months ago, before the introduction of Battle Royale. Since the release of Battle Royale the App has been updated to include PvP oriented features as well.

&amp;nbsp;

In the App you can find Battle Royale specific features such as:

- Profile/Stats Search, view stats per platform and squad type, powered by StormShield.one
- Weapon stats and comparison of all the weapons.
- The Map with an optional higher density grid for more exact coordinates.
- Info and Tips that may be useful if you are not yet an expert.

Some screenshots can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/6zUwr
I hope to add Leaderboards, important map locations and a way to view the cosmetic deals soon.
Since you know the game mode better than me feel free to bombard me with suggestions of what would be good to include into the App! :)

&amp;nbsp;

If you also play the PvE part of Fortnite and haven't tried the App yet then there is a bunch of features and information for you too. If you don't, maybe the App can convince you to join us! :)

&amp;nbsp;

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.companion.fortnite

&amp;nbsp;

iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/companion-for-fortnite/id1267999556?ls=1&amp;mt=8

 &amp;nbsp;

The App has been well received so far and it has only gotten better with each week, introducing more features and content. I hope to build more on the PvP side as well so the App becomes the only thing you need regardless of which Fortnite Mode you play.
Any suggestions (good tips, new features etc) are very welcome here or via the Feedback button in the App.

Thanks in advance and good luck gaming out there :)

Imagine if there was the ability to earn v bucks while playing fortnite BR! There is already daily challenges which is amazing, what if they added say 25 or 50 v bucks on every daily challenge? That would give people the incentive to grind every daily, and play different styles which the challenge wants. It would give EVERYBODY the ability to buy that certain item they had their eyes on. Many people will still buy v bucks considering it would still be a grind to earn enough for any item. 
 
If it's not done this way, I'm sure the community would love a way for us to earn v bucks, in any form. I know that survive the storm gives you v bucks, but not everyone has that game (I do and it still takes awhile to add up) (especially because of those damn llamas) 

On a side note. Imagine gun challenges that arnt daily, but overall. And once you get x amount of kills with whichever weapon, you could get camos. Could be color and weapon separated, or just weapon. Would be cool though!",FortNiteBR

If you do not believe this I don't know what to say.

The problem is the strength of walls

Unless you have a sniper rifle or godlike aim to hit two headshots without ads then there is no way to punish somebody for running across an open field because they can place enough wall down before you kill them to where you have to reload. Once they have their fortress and you have exposed yourself and given your position away by firing on them you are at a significant disadvantage because the person in the middle of the field has a base and you have maybe a tree and you (usually) can't build right next to trees. This encourages people to make bad plays and makes them less likely to get punished for them. 

The solution would probably be to make walls have a half to full second cool down in order to stop them form immediately spamming walls.
Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong and/or what you would suggest.

It's mainly a mild annoyance more than anything else, but can be  especially disrupting when you're racing someone to a chest for a gun only to get stuck hitting open over and over on the false chest while the loot is sitting around you.

Similarily, ammo chests on bookshelves sitting on middle shelves. Would be great not having the ammo pop out and up to the very top shelf causing us to have to jump to get in range to collect it.

Queue as a 3 man

Your Mission: Protect The Random!

You must escort the random aka the VIP through the map to the final circle! Letting the random die means you failed your mission. 

That is the game in a nutshell. Do literally everything to get the random alive. Build around him, give him your shield potions, juice, even your best weapons. Do everything in your power as a 3 man to keep that random dude alive. 

Also, if you manage to get a random with a mic, you MUST call him Commander and ask for his permission to do anything. 

It makes for some hilarious game play. Randoms never expect it and you catch them completely off guard. Most are used to shitty teammates, so to give them all the attention and give them all of your stuff, it makes everyone in the party happy. 

Then having a separate mission just takes the game to another level. You have no idea if this random is good or shit at the game, if he rushes into stupid situations, all you know is you have to keep him alive!

Try it out sometime! I am sure some of you will love it. ",FortNiteBR

I wanted to start off by saying I am extremely proud of what we accomplished together for Extra Life! We raised a lot of money for a great cause!

With that being said, and for those who are curious, I will be stepping down as moderator from both /r/Fortnite &amp; /r/FortniteBR.

I first heard about Fortnite years ago before Alpha phase had even started. Once Fortnite was officially announced at E3 this year, I was ready to jump aboard the hype train. I quickly volunteered to assist in helping the subreddit and community grow. I was very active in /r/Fortnite during its infancy at that time through launch.

As our mod team grew, I transitioned to more of a backend role for the subreddit. While you may not have seen me active in the community, I was mainly working with modmail, modqueue, and most importantly, helping to build the foundation of a positive and recioprical relationship between Reddit and Epic Games. It has always been my goal to have this relationship be a strong and successful one, and I believe that goal has been accomplished.

My passion for the game grew further once Fortnite: Battle Royale was announced and we created /r/FortniteBR. Despite the ups and downs that came with it, I was excited to grow the community further.

Anyways, real life obligations has made it so I cannot devote as much time as I had hoped or liked in recent and upcoming days and it would not be fair to my fellow moderation teams to sit around and be dead weight. I leave both subs extremely proud of what we have built and I look forward to what Fortnite, /r/Fortnite, and /r/FortniteBR become.

If time allows down the road, I may come back, but right now, both subreddits are left in great hands.

With them I  have around 70 total wins in duos and team , 20 or something in solos.  I love this game ,I'll happily  play whatever it becomes evolves but I do have a mild thing that annoys me.


I personally think we see a lot of people hiding and making it to the top 10 or  winning with less than  2 kills because a lot of mechanics limit those who engage more  opponents, for example. ..

Shields: if I kill 6 people on the way to the middle fighting  people I see for their loot I may end up with a  Blue AR or burst,  but I likely won't have any shield. Someone who avoided  many fights very likely has 100 shield.  That's double my health. 


Health : health capping at 75 without  med kits  to me feels like a disadvantage to fighting more as well because I go multiple kills without medkits many times and at 75 you are at risk to be one shot by a bloomed AR bullet. 

Ammo : This is  more rng than the others.  Some games we get 10 kills or so combined and have plenty of medium ammo to split between the group,  but many games we are left  with  very low ammo  even looting ammo boxes on route.  Now I know some of you say oh there's always enough ammo if you kill and only passive players run out ,but we've had squad games were our total kills was 12+, all had purple or gold guns and between us 4 around 90 medium rounds which is a mag a piece. 

They adjusted the medium  ammo to 20 per pickup which was obviously deemed toof much ,but I'd like to see 15.

 Air drops - One thing I feel that helps diminish passive play is air drops,   they really help push people to move and get in fights. 

I also know some games you can get a ton of kills , they drop a ton of ammo and everything seems gravy. But I find in my mind top often  game mechanics promote passive game play for the average person. 


Disclosure -These are just my views, I feel the game is great but a few small mechanical shifts could weed out a little of the passive play .

But maybe the game developers don't want that ,maybe you like passive play , it's just my input.

However, there are a few things that EPIC could do to improve the game in my opinion. 

**[Consumables]**

*Shield:*  First of all, shields are too strong. You shouldn't feel naked when running around with 100hp. I would suggest a complete rework of the shielding mechanic. In fact, I would change the blue potion to a red potion. Five seconds to drink, gain +25 health points to a maximum of 150 health points total. There is no reason to have two ""health"" bars when they both serve the same purpose. Shield not draining in the storm is a big oversight in my opinion, so it would also fix this issue. Players should have some form of light aura around their character to show their boosted HP.


^edit: ^what ^I ^meant ^is ^both ^the ^shield ^and ^HP ^should ^drain ^at ^the ^same ^rate ^in ^the ^storm.  ^So ^if ^you ^start ^at ^100 ^shield ^| ^100 ^hp, ^you ^end ^up ^at ^like ^75 ^shield ^| ^75 ^hp ^for ^example.

*Slurp Juice:*  Maybe increase movement speed slightly for 120 seconds.

*Bush:*  The Bush should only be 1 stack. When used, it should stay in your inventory, taking a slot until it is destroyed. Current drop rate should be reduced. 

Personally I don't think consumables (except bandaids) should be stackable, but if you insist, make them all stack the same. For example, medkits should stack to a maximum of 2. Adding the ability to craft a medkit from 15 bandaids could be an interesting addition. 

**[Weapons]**

Increase time to kill by nerfing the critical strike multiplier of certain weapons. At 100hp, a sniper headshot should kill a player but not a body shot. Dying from a headshot with full HP and full shield feels wrong. The current crit multiplier of shotguns and AR is also way too high. Headshots are really easy in this game especially with the verticality involved. 

I would also suggest to put an ammo cap for weapons. For example, limiting rockets to 15, medium bullets 200 rounds, heavy ammo 50 rounds, shotgun shells 100. You could slightly increase the ammo count per stack and fix the DUO/SQUAD ammo ""issue"".

Unless you nerf shotguns into the ground, the only way I could see SMGs work in this game is to remove recoil and make them very accurate (with limited range of course). I don't understand the point of having 2 different SMGs either. 
 
Rocket riding should be fixed. It cheapens the game. If not, the rider should definitely take some damage every seconds while riding it. 

**[Materials]**

Make all materials start with the same HP and fill at the same rate or increase the base health of brick/metal when you first deploy it. Wood is currently the best material to use as a bullet sponge and it doesn't feel right. 

**[User Interface]**

The pink text/warning in the middle of the screen ""The Storm is coming..."" is quite disturbing and it blocks a good portion of the screen. Please fix this it truly irritates me, especially during a fight. 

First person servers would be very nice.

**[Cash Shop]**

Honestly, the current pricing is completly nuts. I would much rather have the option to purchase a ""season pass"" for a reasonnable amount and be able to have access to most skins during a season. ",FortNiteBR

I honestly can't help but think the devs are just being trolls at this point, they read this sub and they see all of the posts about bushcampers, so I wouldn't put it past them.



I know a load of people view this as a 'funny' and 'cool' addition to the game, but at what point does 'funny' just ruin the game. I know this is an 'arcade' game and it shouldn't be taken too seriously, but who thought it was a good idea to enable people to literally become fucking bushes. I know this may seem a bit of a drastic assumption to make, but if they add any more 'funny' things into the game, i'll probably end up quitting, since I enjoy playing games that aren't taken as jokes by the developers themselves.


Bushcamping was bad enough before they added this shit, but now they are literally enabling people to just BECOME the bush.



Before the influx of 'get good' comments come in, what on earth am I meant to do about the bushes, there are literally tens of thousands of those things throughout the map, unless i'm meant to shoot every one and give away my position???


I know its early access and they are still adding a load of shit to the game, but that doesn't mean you can just add in half baked updates or like this, simply bullshit for the fun of it. The leaderboards don't serve any purpose right now and it'll most likely be weeks till they do, and the bushes have zero counter that doesn't give away your position to everyone. At the very least add a fucking silencer so we don't have to give away our position.

Personally I'm not a fan of hiding in bushes but I can understand how it's a ligit BR tactic. Implementing the bush potion was smart because now a greater number of players will be aware of bush hiders taking them out much quicker making it a less effective tactic First thing I want to say is a LPT. You can check if people are hiding in bushes from a distance if you scope in on any gun and move the cross hairs over a bush, The aim assist will kick in and significant slow down the movement when you move over the bush indicating there is a player there. You don't even have to shoot at it to check. 
Now that that's out of the way I feel as if the bush potion should be tweaked as follows.

- it should take up a spot in your inventory even when in use.
- when you switch it out it goes away and takes a moment to get off before taking out a gun. (Edit to clarify- when taking of it should force the player to stand up so u can see there legs and do a 2 second count down like bandages or a potion)

- when the suit is taken off or put on it makes a audiable sound that all near by players can hear.

Implementing this would I feel would make it a ligit tactic but alittle more balanced.

It seems very extensive on console though. I have to hide, take a few seconds to get things in order, and hope no one pops around the corner or has me in a scope. 

It would be nice to be able to hold Y (on xbox) and then control pad left or right to reorganize a little faster. I'm not a dev and don't even know if it's possible, but the way it is now isn't terrible, just takes your eyes off of the map and your surrounding area. Maybe this is too petty to worry about, but not having to go into the menu to change loadout order would be cool. 

I'm curious on what others think on this? Is it something you guys feel should be easier or is it fine to you now?",FortNiteBR

This means that there is no actual bullet. You either hit or miss based on (and arguably too random) bloom or cone. If all weapons were altered to preform like snipers already do (ie. as a projectile with bullet drop), which is a very common suggestion (and is how PUBG is designed, and most would say that this is why PUBG has ""better gunplay""), then I believe what we would see (other than a huge change in the META) is a global frame-rate drop. More projectiles that have to be calculated means more processing power is needed for such a common occurrence as shooting a rifle in a BR game with 100 people. I think that this is part of the reason why PUBG runs so poorly and/or is so poorly optimized at this moment.

The biggest problem with auto rifles is that they don't have damage drop off and can knock out any player that's fully bandaged up with one lucky bullet. It turns 1v1s into a coinflip where luck seems to be the most deciding factor.

I landed not too far from my team mates who landed at the prison. Three of them got downed so I ran back to help them. 

I ended up downing a squad of four with a pump shotgun, and another three who were spread out within the prison after reviving my team mates, so by this time you can tell I had a lot of loot options.

I proceeded to revive the three of my team mates, drop them bandages, shields and what not and as I turn my back, they just shotgun me down and proceed to message me abuse in a different language, which translated to ""thanks for the loot"" followed by abuse.

I end up leaving that game and I get paired in a party with them again. I remember their usernames because of the messages.

This time I choose to land somewhere completely different at the opposite side of the map. I grab my loot and materials, get a few kills and I notice them coming my direction.

The safe zone was still huge and for some reason they were still coming in my direction. I was running around the map in basically circles to see if they would still follow me and they were.

By the time it hit 11 players left, I just set up a square fort and waited to see what they would do. As they came closer, low and behold they start throwing nades at my fort. 

Not completely destroying it, they ran into my fort trying to shotgun me. Sick of taking deaths I just whipped out an rpg and downed all three of them. 

I then put a roof on my fort with a door, trapping them inside and left them to play the game as normal. A squad eventually found them and killed them, then I went on to win the game.

I've won two games, but they were both free wins -- in the first, I killed one player to secure myself the 1v1 at the end, I knew where the guy was, but he must have trapped himself and he died in the gas(the shipping yard on the east side of the map, not Dusty Depot -- further east). 

The second game I won which was two days ago, was just as free. Three of us were left, and one guy had a big fort. I didn't want him to hear me because I still lack confidence in my shot, so I didn't try to build up to him. I was just creeping around his base trying to get an angle. Anyway, somehow he shot a rocket which killed him and the other player. 

Tonight though, this was different. I started off in one of those areas where it's a house and a shed(tires to bounce you to the second story of the shed, usually a chest there) and killed the guy who landed near me. I started heading toward Anarchy to hopefully find a player or some loot and ran into a guy in the middle of nowhere and killed him. I made it to the farm and heard someone shooting just on the edge but I couldn't find them. Killed two people coming out of the gas and got a supply drop, and the circle was closing in on Loot Lake. Picked up an RPG and a sniper, started heading that way, shotgunned a guy right at the lake, sniped a dude *in* the lake, and finally felt confident enough to just start building(four left alive including me). I built a 2x2 base pretty high up with stairs giving me an angle on anything I needed. I heard a sniper go off and saw that a kill happened in the feed, so I knew where the last guy was. I used the rockets to blow up trees between me and him and he was a bush right at the edge of the gas. 

He saw where I'd been peeking with the rockets, so I went to another set of stairs and sniped him. Felt pretty good to have actually picked up the final kill rather than having it handed to me. Only got 7 kills, but like I said, I'm not confident in my shot, so I don't often land in the cities or even at the farms. ",FortNiteBR

So I love games and I love playing FPS games, but I’m shockingly bad at them as I’m Dyspraxic and have poor coordination so tend to never play online. But Fortnite looked amazing and I saw it all over YouTube so had to play. 

My first ten to fifteen rounds I died constantly. I mean I’d have a gun, try and shoot someone and BAM they wiped my out with a pistol.  I was all over the place. So I became what many people hate, a hider, a camper.

Although I know this isn’t the way most people would play, I still enjoy it and I managed to last quite a while longer. All of a sudden I got some luck, someone ran in front of me and WHACK, killed them with a tactical and they dropped a blue sniper. I killed 3 people on my way to the last ten, knocked out another 5 in the second to last circle and was thinking “this is my time!” I got too cocky. They downed me, but I was determined. 

The next round I found a tactical and hid in a hut whilst everyone around shot each other. I did not move. The storm kept coming in yet I was unshakable, I did not move. I did not have to move, the storm just shrank around me. Before I knew it I was in the last 3. The anxiety, the anticipation built. My opponents were shooting at each other with assault rifles. Last two. I stayed, heart beating, nervous as hell. Foot steps were heard through the trees, slowly approaching my hideout, where I now call home, my finger on the trigger. The footsteps come closer, I see a glimpse of him. I’m frozen with fear. He walks in to explore to find this mystery opponent. He’s in my sites. One squeeze of the trigger and this is it, I can win a match online in any game for the first time since I started playing games!

BANG! One shot and he’s down! I win! I can’t believe it!

""When we think about making hero abilities, we want to make sure it's not only fun for the player using the ability, but also fun for the player being attacked.""

Well, in Fortnite we have a trio of traps that are the definition of piss poor design.

If you die to a trap, it's horrible because you don't see it and boom, it's game over.  It's just not fun like dying  in other parts of Fortnite frequently is.

If you kill someone with a trap it's rarely fun for a fee reasons.

1.  Traps don't give us a reason to hang on to them.  If you pick up a trap, it's usually in the first 2 minutes of the game, and you usually have to place it right away.  There's no reason to hang on to a trap, so there's no fun choice to make.

2.  Now traps CAN be fun under one specific scenario, which is getting people to chase you, and you lead them to the trap.  That's fun for the trap setter but still sucks for the chaser.

3.  Lastly, traps kill people too frequently when the trap layer no longer cares about the trap.  You'll be on your way to doing something else and boom, the kill feed says you got a kill.  That's not fun for either party.

4.  Epic already said actually laying the traps is a known issue they're working on.  Right now it's just too cumbersome to set the traps.  

So if you want Epic to take notice and fix their traps, use your voice.  I'd like to hear what your ideas are to change the traps as there's a ton of really interesting ideas.",FortNiteBR

Now, when you hit left on the D Pad, you can talk to the remaining 10 players until there is a winner.  So it's push to talk for public chat, and regular mic chat for talking to teammates.

Is there anyone who doesn't think this would be a blast?!",FortNiteBR

After some trial and error, my theory is that every time you get near a bush there's a chance that the sound will play. It wasn't happening for all bushes, so it's either a chance thing or only certain bush types trigger it. 

Either way, I think this is a great subtle addition to the game because it subconsciously trains players to look at the bushes around them. I think this in addition to the new AmBush is Epic's way of training the player base to learn to be aware of bush wookies without removing the playstyle. 

What do you guys think?

Edit: Some people are suggesting it could be that the bush disguise destruction sound is global. In my experience it seems to sound like nearby bushes but I could be wrong. I walked next to 4 bushes in a row and they each made a sound when I got close to them. Could be coincidence I suppose ",FortNiteBR

We dropped the ball on this, our bad. We've seen a lot more recent chatter and have mobilized on our end.

Don’t get me wrong. I love this game. I am level thirty and poor all of my free time into this game. I am a free to play player and that’s were my issues start. I know epic games is a company and they have to make money, and I take no hits at them for adding cosmetic items. They didn’t even put them into lot boxes make them easy to get/find. My problem is that there is no incentive to grind the game at all. Once you get to level 10 and get a bad emblem, and then you get to 25 and get a honestly really crappy glider, there is no longer to a reason for a free to play person to play. I know with the implementation of the seasonal shop there is a reason to grind, but all I’m asking for is maybe one or two high level items that are obtainable by playing the game a lot. Again I’m not trying to hate or say epic isn’t doing a good job because they are doing a great job.",FortNiteBR

With that being said, the amount of negative posts I see on a daily basis kind of makes me a bit upset. 
Epic is doing an outstanding job of communicating with the players on a weekly basis, which is hard to find and greatly appreciated. 
I just want to see some great vids, stories and constructive conversations between this community.
A large majority of posts are just rants and complaints about fairness of price or campers.
the fact that Epic released a consumable bush just for those people warms my heart to the core. 
You guys at Epic deserve the 20 Mil players and more, as well as the cash for this beauty of a game.   ",FortNiteBR

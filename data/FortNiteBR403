People said the star wars prequels werent bad too. And Destiny. You're so far in denial that you cant see that Epic isnt fixing any of the various bugs or things people complained about since god knows when. They just give you shit to make up for shoddy game balance and not being able to build on consoles. Fortnite could be such a fun game if Bloom, traps not reseting and the stairs not being impossible to build on consoles, various bugs, the double pump and probably much more didnt exist.

This game feels like its going south. Like 50 Shades of Grey, its fine to do shitty things as long as you give them gifts. It isnt that fun anymore. I wanna get good at the game, but the game works directly against me and the better I get the more I realise bloom makes it so even an idiot can kill me if luck is in their favor. 

Im a new player, but you must be off your rocker if you think adding stuff is doing anything but making the game worse.

Who the fuck asked for a Chug Jug or a Minigun. And now a knew silenced? Like, remove Double Pump and make smgs and pistols better first. The balance is insane. 

It also feels like the more they add the more it feels like how Minecrafts inventory space hasnt changed since the start of the game (Ok shulker boxes exist now, but Minecraft had like 4 times as much items and still the same inventory space)

What the hell do I even put now? I wanna try the minigun more, but its so damn rare (Another thing is they add overpowered items and make them rare so you cant say much...) and if I already need an AR, a shotgun and a sniper and healing then it just barely fits (and doesnt if you double pump.)  Not to mention Id just rather have the RPG anyways.. and why the light ammo? Why not balance the weapons that use it rather than adding a bunch to see what sticks. If its supposed to be personal choice why are shotguns thr only viable close range weapon?

The more you add the harder it is to balance. Thats pretty basic. 

Its like swimming against a current. Im so addicted because I wanna get good, but the game feels like its *trying* to push me back. 

Im probably gonna get a ton of hate for this, but people just want to hate me because ""Epic is Da bess compony evar!!!1!+!1!+@11!1""",FortNiteBR

 We all play Fortnite instead of other battle royale games mainly because the building mechanic, the fps and the FAST PACED GAMEPLAY. If you guys ever played PUBG the game is just running and looting. Fights are slow and you have to calculate everything. Besides that everyone's camping.
 Basically what Tilted Towers did is added those camping rooms and removed the fast paced gameplay because everyone now is just camping there. We used to see at least 6-7 players Salty or Fatal Fields but now its 2-3 players. Tilted Towers is like PUBG in Fortnite. In my opinion it completely ruined the Fortnite experience and the reasons why i liked it. Now I'm not saying this because i suck and can't takeover it, far from it, but i liked the older version more. This placed needs to be nerfed or removed completely",FortNiteBR

My enemy knows I am close, or might even be fighting me already.  He either has the option to kill my downed teammate and ruin our game (but also put himself at a disadvantage by giving me an opening), or take the fight with me and have a better chance of winning, which would result in himself and his teammate also surviving.  Some good points made nonetheless (needing ammo/gun, completing tasks, eliminating the downed teammate from calling your position, selfish kd stats).  ",FortNiteBR

That pump shotgun is OP at range! Massively OP at range! No way should it get as much damage as it does at the range it does. It's turning this game into an elitist hard-core only game and it's going to turn away all the average and below average casuals like myself because we can't Insta head lock on people with it. 2 wall piece builds yes, agree with the damage... anything over that it shouldn't be getting anywhere near the damage it gets, the whole META of fortnite is pump or double pump. You don't use it get ready to be one shotted and Insta melted from medium range.

What's the point of an AR or submachine gun? No point at all with that pump getting those numbers at medium range. Sorry but I have to say, well done to all the sweaty pants people who can lock onto headys instantly but us casuals are gonna drop this game so fast if hey don't nerf the range of that thing. At least in an AR battle we have bloom to help us casuals against the hard-core with a bit of RNG thrown in. Pumps are too powerful at too big a range.

Let the downvotes commence but bear in mind, without us casuals you sweaty bunch are literally gonna have cracked up bunny rabbit jumping beans spamming jump/pump/jump all game long. We're you're bread and butter and pad your K/D for you, were going to be a dying breed if this doesn't get nerfed

Edit: I'm not crying for help because I cant kill people or crying because I need to get good and I'll add a TL;DR and I have written too much. Merely saying, you create a weapon like this with so much damage to one shot someone not fully shielded from such crazy range for a shotgun and you run the risk that the people (like myself) who aren't as fast to lock onto headshots to make using the pump viable eventually walk away as the META is jump/pump/jump because that range is crazy for a shotty (in my opinion)

TL;DR:
A casual like myself who isn't able to get Insta one shot headys with a pump feels like the range is too far for the damage output, it caters for the hard core and could push alot of the casuals away eventually. ",FortNiteBR

**Damage amplifier**. For a burst period (~10 seconds?) your shots do more damage. While damage amping, your player model will glow brightly and be easily identifiable (aka give your opponents the chance to GTFO if they can prepare for it).

Then I played Fortnite. I honestly feel like I may be putting more time into this game than when I first found out about Rocket League. The concept is amazing, the gameplay is extremely fun, it's casual yet competitive, it's FREE, and most importantly the developers are fantastic.

If you’re deciding whether or not to purchase the Season 3 Battle Pass and if it’s worth it, check out the following...  

Let’s do simple mafs. 
( All items have been based off of Item Shop prices )

VBucks = 1,200
Blue Squire Skin = 1,200
Pulse Axe Pickaxe = 800
Sparkle Glider = 1,500
Royale Knight Skin = 1,200
Ride The Pony Emote = 800
Wave Emote = 200
The Worm Emote = 800
Axecalibur Pickaxe = 800
Sir Glider The Brave Glider = 500
Royale X Glider = 500
Floss Emote = 800
Sparkle Specialist Skin = 1,500
Ac/DC Pickaxe = 1,500
Black Knight Skin = 2,000

= 14,500 VBucks 

9.99 = 1,000
24.99 = 2,800
59.99 = 7,500
99.99 = 13,500

So in actuality, the Battle Pass is worth more than $100 since even buying the $99.99 option would still not be enough. Now, of course, this is excluding if you receive VBucks for Playing PVE. This is also excluding Emoticons &amp; XP Gains. 

$10 for $100 worth of items? If you have the time and am able to unlock all items and get to Tier 70 then the Battle Pass is well worth it.

I'm seeing a lot of people saying to counter the minigun, you just have to return fire with a more accurate weapon... and in solo mode, I would agree....

 Epic Games every time you update, the servers lag more and more but your more focused on the materials in game than actually being able to play it.

Epic, whats your stance on it?","I know double pump has been mentioned many times before. I wanted to just plainly ask if its ok to cancel an animation thats meant to balance a weapon?

For me, having double or triple of the same weapon isn't the problem. If the weapons are loaded then you should be able to hot swap and shoot. BUT if the weapon has a mechanic(pump animation) to keep gun play balanced and you can skip it then thats an exploit.

My suggestion is to have every weapon that has a balance mechanic to have its mechanic ""state"" saved. Check if the mechanic has played yet or not. 

This way when a player shoots a weapon and hot swaps to another and then swaps back to the first weapon, he still needs to ""run"" the mechanic to shoot again.

So players can still do double pump but only one cycle. Or even triple but only one cycle...

If you play like that, you often have these 2 following problems:

- No Shields lategame
- No Materials, cause if you are an advanced/good player, you build like crazy. Often I fight somebody and then right after I killed him an other guy appears and i dont had a chance to refill my resources. Other point is, lategame the most players have there buildings, where they sit and wait. Nothing wrong about that, but its a huuuge amount of resources needed to get even close to their buildings if you dont have a rocket/grenade launcher. Most of the time you get shot from different directions and you need to also build all over the place. So, and most of the times these fort builder dont have much wood. 

You most likely spend 400 wood for that kill, and in the worst case you have even less health than before. So if you would'nt have pushed him, you were in a better situation, and that's the point.

Aggressive Players dont get rewarded enough.

Solutions: 
Every dead player should drop 1 Mini shield or an amount of wood (75, 100 or something).

They all have really great personalities to them, and even if they don't have the best loot, they're still aesthetically pleasing.

With that being said, compared to the other POI's (not just the new ones on the west side), it feels like Wailing Woods is too outdated. It's simply just a blob of trees on top of some dirt with a house in the middle with a few shacks around it. Not to say that it isn't a fun place to fight in, because some of my most memorable moments have happened in Wailing Woods, but it feels so bland. With a name like ""Wailing Woods,"" you would think spooky, haunted, or something along those lines, but none of those descriptions really match the actual area. 

I've thought up a few suggestions to try and create that eerie atmosphere:
* add some sort of haze/fog (not to heavy so vision isn't obstructed)
* add new abandoned houses around the forest
* add more variety to the terrain (trenches, trees that have holes to be shot through, big roots to jump/crouch/hide in)
* replace the middle maze area with a much larger house/castle/whatever (I think one of the most iconic parts of Wailing Woods is having one big objective in the center of the woods, so keeping that would be great)
* have the overall brightness of the area toned down slightly because of the leaves blocking sunlight (not too much, brightness can be extremely frustrating to deal with sometimes)

Those suggestions are pretty vague, but they're mainly meant to start discussion. The traffic at Wailing Woods is so small but the potential for amazing fights there is so high. All of the natural cover and limited building area provides for some crazy unique gun battles. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I'd love to hear yours!",FortNiteBR

If someone opens fire on you with a minigun from medium-to-long range, don't try to build. That's what the minigun likes.

Instead, crouch, move minimally, and calmly return fire with an AR, sniper, or revolver. You will outshoot the shit out of Mr. Minigun.

Miniguns counter two things which shift the game flow in interesting fashion:

1. Small-foundation bases (you know, the good 'ol spin-n-stair)
2. Building insta-peek to invalidate a positioning disadvantage.

You know what miniguns can't do? Snipe you.

Now with all that said, you can still out build a minigun. It's just a matter of how much ammo they have and how many resources you have. I had 2 people mini gunning me in squads and I out built them for what seemed like 2 minutes of constant shooting until they ran out of bullets. It only cost me 1.7k resources and 120 health with the odd bullet that gets through.

You can check my stats on the fortnite tracker network! Important is what i have achieved in the shortrun. 8+ K/D in over 130 Matches. (https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/fuN1337)

Besides, I am an experienced CS:GO player with over 3,3k hours. I am currently in Rank G (semi pro league) competing for a spot in Rank S (Pro league). I have played in different teams and I competed in the Austrian Pro League in the first Season (csgo.alpenscene.at)


I want to share everything i have learned about fortnite and help players like you to become the next Fortnite God! (Or brag in front of your friends ;)

I will coach the first 10 that are interested for free! Why? I want to improve as a coach and I want your feedback and criticism!

*For the first 10 I only have a few requirements:

- I will do 2 sessions of 45 Minutes each (will be scheduled for your comfort)
- You need to have a microphone and headset and be able to hop on discord
- Be 18+ ; I want to start on adults first, because of:
- Feedback. Please let me know if I could help you. Let me now what I could do better! Don't be shy; be mean if necessary, I can take it!
- Speak english, german or italian!

Not a requirement but preferred:

- Stream! If you can stream to twitch and I could watch your games, that would be perfect and even easier for me to analyze your Pros/Cons


I will try my best to personalize the coaching for your playstyle!

TL;DR: Read from *

PS: It doesn't matter if you are on PC/Console - I prefer if you played on PC tho.

PPS: If this goes well I will be opening the coaching sessions for Kids U18 as well :)

Double-pump is an exploitation. The strat is BYPASSING a core mechanic of the shotguns. One of it's only downsides, being the pump action requirement.

Now, before you start complaining or downvote this thread like the average abuser does so, I just want you to acknowledge this. You are legit bypassing the weapon's function and you downvote these types of threads just for your exploitation uses.

Why it's an exploit:

The pump shotgun is meant to be strong, high damage numbers, and slightly longer range than the semi. However, it's balanced due to it's slow fire rate. But, appearantly, we are allowing the weapon to counter it's only downside by running two of them. How the glitch works is, you fire one of your pumps, swap to the other one, fire, and then rinse and repeat. It's extremely simple. This action allows you to fire the pumps at an alarming rate which the weapon is supposed to be downsided on. Why is this still in the game. 

Some people bring up the argument that it takes up two spaces, which I could care less for. I myself would totally take a second pump just so I can abuse this ""legit strat"" instead of a sniper rifle at any given time. But even still, sure inventory slots are valuable, but just because you're using two spaces doesn't mean you aren't abusing an exploit. 

I get that this will be nerfed in due time with the new weapon changes, but dear god this needs to be fixed, weapon falloff, meaning more close range combat, meaning more cheese.

Please, just do it from your heart to bring attention to this post and disallow this ""strat"" to continue. And don't just downvote for your enjoyment of the strat, which is going to be every single abuser as there is no reason someone who doesn't abuse this to keep an exploit in the game. Thanks

TLDR; the shotguns mechanics are being bypassed and exploited to make a strong weapon even stronger without much in downsides.",FortNiteBR

---


Hey guys, I absolutely love the new update so far. Building issues have been reduced tenfold (still need work), I can finally turn off autorun, and the servers seem to be a lot more healthy!

&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, about the minigun. I love it. I will not deny that. It is ***ridiculously*** fun to use. I've yet to even be killed by it, but I have used it to win all 3 of the games that I have played since the update.  
 
&amp;nbsp;


So right about now you're probably wondering what my issue is? 
 
It is simply *too* powerful with no viable way to defend against it. It has a maximum capacity of 999 bullets, all of which can be used in a single, continuous burst, and is capable of destroying multiple walls as they're being built before the enemy even has a chance to get out of the way. The only way to escape it is to find an unbreakable object, run behind structures, or build multiple walls whilst moving backwards until you find cover. 
 If you are not killed by somebody else in the process, you have an extremely high chance of destroying somebody's entire existence with those 999 sequentially firing bullets. 
 The gun is just too powerful at the moment, and this is coming from somebody on the delivering end of the punishment.


&amp;nbsp;


So what do I suggest? Definitely do not remove the gun, do not decrease the fire rate, and do not decrease the damage, for there is something far, far more appropriate and sensical:

 &amp;nbsp;


A cooldown time. 
 In my honest opinion, this gun should have a short, incremental bar-style cooldown period after 7 seconds of consecutive shooting. So this would be a small white bar somewhere non-obstructive (possibly above the weapon hotbar) that fills up with a red bar as the weapon is fired continuously. When the weapon stops firing, the bar starts to empty from the point that it reached. 
 For example, if no red is visible in the bar, the bar is at 0% and ready to fire, if the bar is at 100%, it has been fired for 7 consecutive seconds and will take 3/4 seconds for the bar to empty fully and for the weapon to fully cool down, at which point it is ready to be fired again. If the weapon is fired for 3.5 seconds the red bar will be at 50% and will take 1.5/2 seconds to empty completely and for the weapon to cool down. 

&amp;nbsp;

The figures given are suggestions and mainly for the purpose of providing an example, I don't have to resources to fine tune these numbers so they are just rough estimates based on my 3 games of using it. Please give your thoughts in the comments, and let me know if you agree or disagree.

He had racked up a serious stash of bullets and basically obliterated me and anything I built causing me to end up looking like some melted Swiss cheese because there wasn't a cooldown on the fire of the gun whatsoever. I don't think it needs a damage nerf because it creates a whole new meta for the end game, but I do think it needs a cooldown on the barrel as it is due to the sheer fact that if you have a minigun and enough bullets, you can just hold down the trigger and basically win in the final circle with one hand.",FortNiteBR

Hi all! aFrequ here, I usually do this for the StW sub, and we decided it'd be a good idea to start doing it for BR too! As with every patch, new bugs pop-up. In the interest of not flooding the sub with the same bug post, and to make it a little easier on Epic to keep track of all the bugs reported on this sub, we thought it'd be a good idea to keep all of them condensed to one thread. 

***Please use the format provided below (you can just copy paste it), and please check if your issue has already been posted before posting it yourself.*** There is no reason to flood the thread with the same bug, as the upvote system will sort items by severity:

    **Explanation**:

    **Evidence**:

    **If  replicable, how**:

    **Platform**:

It is possible that some of the reports will be deleted. If so, it's highly likely that what you reported ruins the ""integrity"" of the game (exploits).

____

EDIT:

***Please, please, please, follow the format and check if the issue has already been posted.*** We will delete it otherwise. If you want to say, ""hey, this bug is happening to me too,"" then just reply to the comment. If you think you have a potential fix to a listed bug then just reply to the comment. The point of this thread is to have a collection of bugs that are presented in a way to help the devs out by providing more info than simply just, ""Hey, x is going on. Fix it pls, ty,"" and having the up vote system sort the bugs by severity and frequency instead of just repeating the same bug a hundred times, and hiding lesser severe/frequent bugs that may have also been able to brought to attention if one didn't have to wade through a torrent of comments about the game not fitting on their screen.

Thank you.

I dunno why but I feel like here lately every BR game seems super freaking fun when it 1st comes out and there isn't a ""super competitive"" side to the game. Then all the ""pros/super competitive"" players move over to the new hot game and then game just becomes so much less about fun but more about trying hard all the time. :( I miss the way it was in season 1 where everybody just played for fun I suppose. I mean I'm the kinda person who plays normal on League of Legends over ranked though. I do understand there are tons of people who eat, breath, and sleep BR/Shooters and I just feel like those people should have a ""Ranked"" mode to play and let the people no really worried about being #1 play in a casual mode. Maybe it's just me and my friends but everything was just so much more fun early in season 1. 

I also feel like having a ranked and casual mode would be nice for weapon balancing and trying out new stuff and see if it fits a more ""ranked type"" before you put it in ya know. Just my thoughts though! What do y'all think Ranked mode and Casual Mode or just keep them mixed as one?",FortNiteBR

There are some developer fees that are required in order for it to be in the app store which is why I am contemplating starting it out at $1.99.

I'd love to add more features in the future as more data becomes available but with the limited API I am currently working with, this is about all I am able to do. 

Current Features (works for all platforms!):

* See your own personal stats categorized by game mode 
* See anybody else's personal stats categorized by game mode with a simple search
* Save users as friends to quickly view their stats without having to search for them again by username
* My personal favorite is the compare players feature. A nice side by side comparison of you and another user's stats.

See screenshots for a better understanding!

* [User profile page](https://ibb.co/egm1B6)
* [Friends page](https://ibb.co/hDZ4W6)
* [Compare players page](https://ibb.co/bXRUym)
* [Search for friends page](https://ibb.co/mdtL4R)

I'd love to hear any feedback you may have. I'd love to continue to build on onto the app with the help of this great community!

EDIT: I'm getting a ton of hate (which is perfectly ok, I wanted your opinion!) asking why I would charge $1.99 for something that does relatively the same thing as something that is already free. The main reason I built this app was because the other services (although they are already great) such as storm shield and fortnite tracker didn't really have the nice UI and UX I was looking for. Plus, I feel like it adds a nice convenience factor that some users may appreciate. 

EDIT: Thanks to all for the feedback! If I decide to publish it, I will go ahead and make it free with ads with the option to remove ads for a fee. Thanks again!",FortNiteBR

Plus an additional 900+ from PvE dailies.* Thus, with the challenges and the V-bucks I will have, essentially I am currently at tier 53.

I know there have been so many times where i was jumping left and right smacking someone with my pickaxe and then right before they die they finally land a hit. A sword could be fairly balanced and useful as long as it doesn’t do too much damage. 

Something like a sword would be fun to use against against other players.

Such as: 
White: Basic Rusty old Sword - Slower swing rate (15 dmg) 

Green: Newer condition sword - Slow swing rate ( 17 dmg ) 

Blue: Katana of some sort - Around the same rate as a pickaxe ( 19 dmg ) 

Purple: A heavier sword of some kind - Slow Swing rate that hits Hard ( 35-40 dmg)

Orange: Something a little more slim than Purple - that ties heavier hitting and speed together - (25-30 dmg )

In theory, it could work as a decoy, but in 95% of the cases you're harming yourself as much as you're harming the enemy, and it's just generally frustrating to be inside one.

The one solid use which it has, is to block vision while you escape, but building does that better and quicker.

Patch V.2.4.0 will be releasing today at 1PM EDT(6PM GMT). We will be taking downtime and you’ll have to download an update.

The V.2.4.0 patch contains a revert back to the V.2.2.0 version of the building bar system (fewer bugs), which should resolve some of the building issues you’ve been experiencing. We intend on finding a more permanent fix to make building and item selection feel more crisp in the future.

If you run into new issues please bring them to our attention on our social channels or by reporting them in-game.

Note: We are still tracking down a bug where the UI reflects you are in building mode when you are actually in combat mode.

What’s coming? Find out [here.](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v-2-4-0-patch-notes)

**UPDATE 20:00 GMT**: We currently do not have an ETA for the return of the servers, we will give players an update at approximately 21:00 GMT.

 **UPDATE 21:20 GMT**: We are back! V.2.4.0 is ready to go, so get out there and see what it has to offer! Players may encounter a waiting room as they enter the game.

 **UPDATE 21:40 GMT**: We are aware that some console players are having issues with resolution. Fixing this is a priority for us and we will let you know when we are ready to deploy a fix. 

**UPDATE 21:43 GMT**: Some players may see an LTM quest for ""Blitz Mode"". This mode is currently unavailable. We're currently working to fix this.

It got a lot of positive feedback and someone suggested I make a separate thread regarding this idea, so that's what I'm doing here. [Here's a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7uk3p4/think_it_up_thursday/dtlg52m/?context=2) to the comment, which I will copy and paste here (along with the follow up comment):
____________

Obviously, when a player is eliminated, we see that tiny device appear above the player and ""beam them up,"" removing them from the map. This idea would allow players to equip their own custom ""kill animation,"" that would replace that tiny device with something else. Some possible examples:

- Upon eliminating a player, a large ""demon hand,"" appears from the ground and pulls the eliminated player ""into"" the ground.

- One or two ""angels,"" swoop in and ""lift"" the eliminated player upwards.

- Puddle of quicksand appears underneath the eliminated player. Player ""sinks.""

- Small black hole appears above eliminated player and sucks him in.

- Player ""turns into,"" a grave stone, which soon disappears.

- Player is encased in a coffin that quickly falls to the ground and disappears.

- Basically a larger version of the current, default death animation, in a way: a flying saucer appears over the eliminated player and abducts him.

Those are just a few ideas, and I'm sure Epic (and the community) could come up with many others if the idea were to take off in some way. To be clear, the custom animations would be the exact same length as the current, default animation. Obviously this doesn't affect gameplay one way or the other, but it would be a cool and unique new cosmetic Epic could sell at various tiers of rarity depending on the animation (ideally cheaper than what we currently have to pay for certain skins, pickaxes and emotes). Just a fun/silly idea I've been tossing around. I'd like to see other cosmetics introduced at some point beyond the usual stuff. Gameplay, optimization, and bug fixes always, always, always take priority, but maybe its something to consider somewhere down the line.

Note that I stress these animations should be the exact same length as the current, default animation so as not to essentially act as a beacon for nearby players -- at least, not any more than the current animation does. So although these custom animations would be flashier, they would still be very, *very* quick. Same principle applies for any distinct sound effects the custom animations would presumably come with; those sound effects should be the same volume as the current animation so it doesn't provide any gameplay advantage or disadvantage by being quieter or louder.

On that same note, any custom animation that consists of an object above the eliminated player's head (such as the black hole or flying saucer) should sit at the same height the current ""device,"" does and obviously should not have any physical properties that could potentially block weapons fire while it's active. 

**TL;DR:** Create custom ""elimination animations,"" we can purchase (OR UNLOCK THROUGH GAMEPLAY/SEASON PASS!) that replace the current, default ""device,"" that beams players off the map once they're eliminated.

EDIT: Added that maybe some of these animations could be earned through standard gameplay/season pass like other cosmetics.",FortNiteBR

Just find more people until it's actually at 100 people in the lobby. Change how it's coded, slightly, until this occurs. 

This should be a priority. 

You should not be adding a minigun to the game and still having most of the matches start with 95-99 people. MOST should start with 100 and you should get a rare game where it went off with fewer. ",FortNiteBR

I completely agree. I've came up with a fix for it, and it sounds good to me. So when you shoot with a pump, you charge it back and then shoot right? Imagine this: You have two pumps, you shoot with one then switch asap to second and shoot. That's alr. But once you switch to the previous pump, the guy charges it again as he would've if you shot with one pump. And it goes on. That's understandable.

I'm going to lay a handful out for you of the ones I use most. Primarily console btw.

1. The smg is outstanding. Seriously, I don't run the m16 much anymore. A blue tactical or standard smg is a very fast killer with plentiful ammo. Don't have to worry about pinpoint aiming with a pump, don't have to worry as much about rng. Just spray.

2. The 3X3 attack hill. So many people build a singular ramp when attacking a base or an enemy on equal footing. This is foolish, as most weapons can destroy the base having you land in a predictable spot. You went from high ground to a disadvantage. When building attack ramps build three side by side and build all three up together. It make you harder to predict as it's three times cover, and it can't be shot down quickly. 

3. Destroy the base of the base. Got 600 ammo and a scar, just start chewing up that fortress. Nothing is more tilting then building a huge fortress and having some scrub delete it by taking out four walls. This can also apply to water towers, sky bridges, ANY BUILDING, and trees. Enemy hiding someone up? Bring me down.

4. The blue burst is incredibly rewarding to people who hit headshots. That's it, it's got a lot of 'burst' damage. Shield or no, two bursts to the head and they gone.

5. Secret landing spots. Currently in the state of the game there are a dozen or so unmarked landing spots with a decent loot haul. Warehouses by greasy, motel by anarchy, house to the north west of wailing, etc. Generally these spots only downside in single or duos is having a longer then average trek if the storm bones you. 

6. Pro farming spots. If you take 2 minutes to farm moisty mire, you will have max wood. If you take three minutes to farm around fatal fields, you will have max brick. Metal is a bit trickier, but junkyard junction has plenty with a slower father rate, while farming fences and cars inside towns is faster but more dangerous. 

7. Learn to snipe with the bolty boi. Short and simple, this gun has by far the biggest effective range. Anything but point blank until about 250 meters it's totally effective. Beyond that, why are you even trying? 

8. Learn what to drop, forget rarity. Got an epic tac shotgun, legendary semi auto sniper, and a legendary grenade launcher? Switch it out for a common pump, and a rare bolt and rocket. It's a lower rarity setup technically, but it's miles more effective.

9. A square on the map is 250 meters and takes 45 seconds to run across. This is also the range where snipers can be heard.

10. Doing some damage to a wall will make it semi transparent and allow you to see what's on the other side. Alternatively if it's your wall you can edit it without changing anything to see straight through.

11. You can fall a full three stories without taking damage.

Edit: Bonus tip I forgot (follow up to the three by three thing).
When attacking a structure, hill, or when you just need to push aggressively, build a much larger version of that. 4-5-6 wide, 3-4 tall, and build forward. Use metal if possible. You can build up to most anything, and shooting it out requires the enemy to show themselves and not be shooting you. Which is risky. Only do this is your confident you can build decently quickly, as while it's simple and can be done easily on console, it's most powerful aspect is how quickly you can assemble a large structure. It's intimidating and hard to counter quickly, so if you think quick you have the odds stacked in your favor.",FortNiteBR

I'd like to see it removed and then replaced with a single fire weapon. One of the Developers said he was a big fan of scout rifles from Destiny. I think a weapon like that could have a place in FortniteBR, even as a replacement to your full auto assault rifle.

Blue, Purple and Orange variants.

Blue : 34 Damage, Higher Recoil, First Shot has perfect accuracy, small amount of bloom applied if shots aren't paced reasonably. (This would of course be after Shooting Model Update) 2.5 HS Multiplier, so 85 damage. Fire Rate : 2.5

Purple : 36 Damage, Slightly Less Recoil, First and second shot accurate, Less Bloom Fire Rate : 2.8

Orange : 38 Damage, Less Recoil than Epic version Fire Rate : 3.1

Bloom for all weapons would be applied based on the speed at which you fire the gun. E.g. Orange weapon has bloom applied after the user starts firing the weapon faster than 2.8 RPS.

Just an idea, numbers could be tweaked obviously.",FortNiteBR

Pubg already copied Fortnite and we have obviously more concurrent players than PUBG. (Though we can't see an exact number.) I have a lot of friends that bought PUBG and they are playing it daily and I am glad I am 15 years old and couldn't afford to buy one, thus I play Fortnite ʘ‿ʘ

Ninja is a decent player, yeah. But can we just start seeing the fact that he left playing PUBG because he couldn't reach a good playerbase on PUBG due to his acts and other streamers? I heard some people talking Ninja is acting like a kid for his audience! That is a lie. I am 15 years old and having fun watching him; HOWEVER, I think we should stop boosting him. 

Can we stop copying other ideas? Guys, let's stay as man. I mean, PUBG copied us already but I see suggestion on the front page that already made on PUBG sub-reddit. I mean, they are already shameful with a game that you pay to play(Free to Play games 4 life!), let them swim in their own pool.

Thanks Epic. You made Fortnite for free. Actually BR were not in your plans and you started developing the base game more and more slowly and unexpected but still, it doesn't matter. Atleast, whenever someone ask me to play a Fortnite rip off game called PUBG, I can say, ""No thanks, I don't pay to play games."" ""I am a Fortnite fan."" and ""We have more concurrent players."" ""Omg you have hackers."" and etc.

Thanks Epic. I am not alone anymore. I found many friends in my middle grade, we are playing together and it is tons of fun! Plus we created a team named TEAM15S, in which name includes our ages and team spirit and the S is not possesive but plural.

Thanks Epic, for great memories. I had 700 metal once a match. I put it and put it respectively, saved my a*s from 30 rocket! Then I started putting stairs randomly up to sky, took my SCAR(do you know they even copied SCAR?) and start shooting the last guy without a recoil. I don't know. Recoil is illogical. We are playing a ""game"" and it shouldn't be in a cyber world. Whatever... It was a great moment.

Thanks EPIC.

Feel free to add on!,"I had a few friends who just started playing this wonderful game and asked me for some (general) advice on how to get better and hopefully win some games. I sent them this and they claim it actually helped so I figured I’d post it here for some of the newer members of this awesome community. 

Full disclaimer: I’m not a streamer or YouTuber trying to gain anything out of this, and I’m also not a god at the game but I average 8-12 kills / game and win somewhat consistently. This got pretty long, but feel free to add on if you feel like I missed something! 

*Learn the map inside and out. Don’t drop in the same place over and over. You should know the layout of every major and minor “town” on the map.*

- Macro vs. Micro: Understand the continuity of the buildings in the game. Once you learn the map as a whole, start learning the map in tiny bits and pieces. Once you realize the house at Salty is the same house as the one on the western side of Pleasant, you’ll have a much easier time getting loot faster which means more 1 on 1 wins. 

- Learn the chest locations. They spawn in the same locations, but they’re random in a sense that they don’t ALWAYS spawn there every game. The difference between knowing the chest is in *this corner of the attic (when flying in) instead of that corner, is the difference between surviving the first 30 seconds of the game or not.

- Learn ammo box locations. Unless you’re running from an enemy who’s shooting you in the back or running from the storm with no meds, opening ammo boxes is SO vital. You might not have a sniper or rockets right now, but when you get to the top 15 chances are you will, and you won’t regret opening those ammo boxes throughout the game.  

- Learn where loot drops (not chests) are! There are certain spots that guns can show up. These will be your best friend when flying in and will be the difference between life and death more often than not.

- Understand how the storm works. After landing you're told where the first circle will be. You have 3 minutes until the storm actually starts to move in, which will take another 3 minutes to fully finish. That's 6 minutes of looting until you have to be within that white circle. Once the circle creates different angles on the map, you'll learn that you may be able to outrun the storm (you running is faster than it closing in). Use this to your advantage! I call it, ""being on the slow side of the storm"" - run to these parts and stay right in front of the storm while it's at your back and use it as a line of defense.

*Learn situation gameplay (watch streamers if you want to learn faster). Understand when it’s time to rush, build or run away. It needs to be completely based on instinct, with little hesitation.*

- The first 60 seconds of this game are crucial (flying and picking up a weapon). Practice flying down and learn how far away to jump and stay at a 45 degree angle towards your destination. If you want to go tilted, I've found that jumping towards the middle of loot lake and descending at a 45 degree angle gets me there pretty damn quick. 

- Shotguns DON'T spawn in chests. Shotguns are OPTIMAL in the first minute of the game. If you know where loot spawns are (not chest spawns), try to grab a shotgun first. Your goal is to be one of the first ones down and first one to get a gun in your area.

- The second you get shot, or shot at (it’s fairly simple to know in this game whether those shots you hear are for you or someone else), start to build a 1 by 1 box with stairs up. Never stand still in that box, because you don’t know who has high ground with a sniper at the back of your head. Constantly strafe while peeking over trying to find who shot at you. 

- If you’re running in or from the storm and you see an enemy, assess whether it’s advantageous to fight or let them go. What’s your health / shield at? What weapons do you have? How far away are they? How far away is the storm? How much farther do you have to run? If you get in a battle and win, do you have meds to survive the storm immediately or for the period of time you’d need to?

- Understand the loot system and what works best for your style of play. You need to figure out (through playing more) what weapons / meds you should have. There will be a time when you kill someone and you must grab all the weapons / meds you can immediately to survive the storm, and you better know whether or not you’re taking mini shields vs. bandages, rocket launcher vs. grenade launcher, shotgun vs. rockets vs. sniper etc. 

- Always assume these things: 1. Every enemy has full shield and health, and they probably have bandages / potion. Don’t assume you’ve got them until they actually go down. 2. Every enemy has a shotgun so when you rush them with yours, you better be ready to either take them down quick or build to survive. 3. Every enemy is going to build once you shoot them, and if they start building, you need to already know your next move. Build with them and push, build with them and try to get a snipe, heal up and wait, put a launch pad down and flee, etc. 4. Every enemy has a sniper, so don't peek too long. Use third person views to your advantage.

- It might sound ridiculous, but start looking at every floor, wall and ceiling when you walk into buildings – the last thing you need is to be killed or weakened by a trap only to have everyone know exactly where you are and that you’re weak.

- Have your inventory set up to your advantage. AR first, shotgun / rockets second, sniper third, meds/shield fourth / fifth is what I use. I run around with my rockets or AR (depending on the situation) and I know exactly what I’m one, two or three clicks away from at all times. Find what works for you and stick with it.

- Unless you have necessary meds, try to start moving from your location 1 minute before the storm starts to ensure you don’t get stuck. The storm should NEVER kill you unless you engage in a fight while in the storm or right before it reaches you. Don’t beat yourself. There are 99 other people trying to do that.

- Understand the med time vs. storm damage. The storm takes off 1 HP (no shield) for the first two waves. Once the second storm reaches its destination it immediately turns into 2 HP at a time. Then it’s 5 and then 10. If you’re low on health and have a medkit, remember to start it before you hit 20 HP if the storm is about to go down by 2. If you have a campfire you can put it down to stall your health while you bandage / medkit up. Shields are useless in the storm.

- When looting your enemy, have your pickaxe out so you only pick up materials, ammo and meds that you can stack. Example: If you have 2 medkits already and see one on the ground, that medkit might actually be 2 or 3 medkits. If go to grab it while you have your Gold SCAR out, you will drop that scar for the additional medkits because you can't carry more than 3 in one slot. If you have your pickaxe out, you will pick up the amount of potions/ medkits / bandages that you can carry and wont result in dropping any weapons.

- Take advantage of being by the edge of the storm and wait for people running out. Remember how many times you've come out of the storm late?... well, it's not just you.


- Be smart and safe. Have floors already out before you slide down a mountain and give yourself floor boards every second or two of drop time to ensure you don’t take fall damage. Again, don’t beat yourself. 

*Understand how the gunplay in this game works. It’s not perfect. There is bloom on every gun (except snipers). Even shooting gold rockets at someone’s feet may not kill them. Expect the unexpected.*

- Always crouch when you shoot your AR. It increases your aim by an unimaginable amount. If you want to run and shoot, that’s fine, as long as you know a majority of your shots will spray randomly. Again, understanding situational gameplay will dictate how you fight sometimes.

- Jumping while shot-gunning can keep you alive and makes you harder to hit, but you also lose the ability to move while in the air.  

- If you’re in a battle, after you shoot rockets immediately pull out your AR or shotgun (depending on the situation). No need to sit there and reload your rocket launcher while you get shot in the face. Use the travel time to your advantage. If they don’t build, that means you’re getting shot. If they do build, shoot their walls down before your rocket does. 

- Snipers have bullet drop based on how far away an enemy is and you have to account for it every shot you take. 

- Tapping the trigger when using your AR makes it much more accurate vs. holding it down and spraying – much more effective at range.

*Practice building and don’t stop until it’s effortless with muscle memory. The best players aren’t the best because of their aim, it’s because they don’t let you get shots on them. Whether you rush them with a double pump and rockets or try to snipe them from across the map, you won’t hit them because of the way they build and they’ll counter whatever you’re using immediately after building to safety.*

- Learn how to edit every single structure. You should know how to make doors, kill holes, windows, openings in rooftops / floors, larger openings in walls in case your wall is built into the ground and you cant build a door, etc. Editing is just as important (if not more) than building itself. 

*Have fun. There’s nothing worse than someone who constantly complains about losing, or lag, or RNG or bloom or bugs. Everyone’s playing the same game and at the end of the day it’s just that – a game. Have fun with your friends and play more. You’ll get better over time and when you win consistently there’s nothing better.*


*TILTED TOWERS*

As someone who goes to titled pretty much every game now and is usually the last man standing, here are my tips:

- Drop earlier than you think and fly down at the right angle. You shouldn't be flying straight down, rather at a 45 or so degree angle. 
- Go for the shotguns on the rooftops before the chests that you know of. 
- Stall in the air and pick a rooftop / building you haven't seen anyone drop on. You may love that one big grey building, but you increase your chances of surviving by staying out of the shit for the first minute or so.
- USE YOUR TRAPS. Can't express this one enough. Those traps on ceilings will increase your kills (and get you better loot) every game. 
- Don't chase. Any Halo players here? Chasing gets you killed. You'll run into a trap, you'll run into an enemy using third person around the wall to shotgun you, or you'll run into a third enemy. Your goal is to survive, not get 100 kills. 
- Never stop moving. Don't sit in one building, or on one rooftop. Don't stop moving because you can be seen from pretty much everywhere. (People from pleasant park can technically see you...)

If I missed anything, feel free to add on to the list!

TL;DR: Learn the map like the back of your hand (chests/ammo boxes/buildings/landscape). Get better at understanding situational gameplay (watch streamers / play more). Understand how each gun works and when you should use each one (again, play more / watch streamers). Practice building as much as you can as well as editing and HAVE FUN!

EDIT: Wow, we’ve got some awesome additions to the list in the comments. Keep ‘em coming! I'll try to update the list with the respective user below:

From /u/MrYoc
 
- Med stacking: Small shields stack x 10 Big shields stack x 2 Med packs stack x 3 Bandages stack x15
- You won't take fall damage if your base is only 3 stories high. Anything more and you can take fall damage from falling out.
- Use mini potions first (gives up to 50 health but cant go past 50) and full potions / slurps after. 
- Use bandages first (they give you up to 75 health) and slurp juice / campfires after to get full health.
- Use your traps in your base! 
- Use your third person view to peek over your building or hills / around walls
- Reload after kills
- Wood has the quickest build rate and most immediate health if your base is getting spammed, brick has more health once its built but takes longer to build initially and metal has the most health but takes longest to build. Learn when to use each material.

From /u/Superb_llama_jeans

- Use natural cover when deciding to heal up in late game If you have natural cover from the landscape (hills, mountain, trees) and your back is to the storm, heal up without building in order to not give away your position.

From /u/Blast_OGK

- Don't run in straight lines, jump or zig - zag.
- Assume everyone has a sniper, don't peek too long!",FortNiteBR

Version 1.0 of your Cozy Campfire is fine in terms of utility but it's severely lacking in terms of fun factor and impact on the game world.  We suggest the following changes...

1.  Add a 3 story tall smoke stack animation.  Campfires should have some kind of interesting risk to them.  As it stands now, they do not.

2.  Increase the duration to 75 seconds.  Right now the 25 second duration is too short for interesting counter plays to develop.  Start with 75 seconds and tweak from there.

3.  Decrease healing to 2hp every 3 seconds.  We now have smoke that has enemy attracting potential.  We have a duration that makes counter play possible.  Now we need a slower heal rate to keep damaged players in one spot.

Right now, we have one ""OMG YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS!!"" type item in the game.  Obviously I'm talking about the Launch Pad.  Battle Royale needs to start adding more of these kinds of items to the game.

Here are just a few organic scenarios that would arise naturally if the Cozy Campfire was changed...

A)  ""Mike and Lisa both have 50 hp.  Let's set them up with the CC down in the valley.  Tom, you and I will flank them on the hills surrounding them and act as lookout for any would be attackers.""

B)  ""We're low on health.  Lets set up the CC right here and heal up.""  ""No. Dusty Depot is up ahead.  Let's run up there and use it inside so no one can see our smoke.  We cant afford another shootout right now.""

C)  ""Guys, we have two Cozy Campfires.  You hear that shootout going on behind us?  Let's set it up, build a little fake base around it, and bait whoever wins to come and use it.""

D)  ""Oh look!  Theres some Cozy Campfire smoke up ahead.  Lets check it out.""  Walks nervously up to an empty CC.  Team using it left 15 seconds ago.  ""Booyah!""

The Cozy Campfire has potential to create wonderful stories in this game.  It's time you rework this item and make it happen!

Sincerely,

The FortniteBR community",FortNiteBR

It ruins the game.  It happens all the time when I play and from what I can tell its mainly when I switch through building pieces quickly.  I'm sorry but I do not believe it is possible for no one to notice this during testing phase of a patch.  It is happens way to often.  

This bug should not be shrugged off by anyone that plays on console.  I get it.  It's a free game.  I can see the comments now ""Calm down Richard you didn't pay for it.""  But this should not get a free pass.

It happens to me EVERY GAME that I have to build fast.  Oh you need a ramp to protect you so you can snipe?...How about a floor built into the ground?  Oh you're dead.  Come on.  This is not a random bug.  It happens every game!  That patch was irresponsible to put out.  The only excuse is they only tested PC and not console.  There is no way that gets through if EPIC testers move through building somewhat quickly.

- **Hunger Games (u/JessieReyez suggestion)**: Everyone starts in a circle and in the centre of the circle are around 6 supply crates and after a certain time (10 seconds) everyone is released and can either go to the crates or run away.

Pump shotguns are suppose to be the slow rate of fire but heavy damage weapon. Being able to quickly swap to the next shotgun quicker than a tactical shotgun can fire (which is the lower damage but quicker rate of fire weapon) is totally unreasonable and unfair. 

There is no ""real"" counter other than just participating in this act yourself. Which in that case, why not just make an only shotgun mode where the people who love to use this tactic can get their fill.

There needs to be some sort of cool-down when switching to another pump.

Clans can see the leaderboard (measured in Vpoints) within the clan, for Vpoints earned per day, week and month. You could also see the clan leaderboard, with the top 50 clans out of groups of 150 receiving vbucks by tiers, such as 1st gets 1000 to distribute and so on. 

Clans will be able to grant permissions, like in CoC. Clan Leaders can organize fun tournaments, team games, and have clan battles.

Clan Battles would be something like 50v50 but in 25v25.  Winning a clan battle will grant a lot of battle points.

It’s taking us longer than expected to fix these issues and we’re working through some major ones. If we’re unable to fix them today the v2.4.0 release will be delayed. Once we have a better idea of when the patch will arrive we’ll update everyone.

In order to help make building feel better we'll be reverting to the building bar system that was present in V.2.2.0. We intend on finding a more permanent fix to make building and item selection feel more crisp in the future. We’ve also added some tools to help us better diagnose in-game issues when new bugs do arise.

Be sure to check the patch notes again because we’ve added more items to the “Known Bugs” section. In addition to that, we’ve also created a “Fixed Bugs” section to inform every one of the immediate fixes we’ve done that delayed this patch. 

Note: We have bugs that will come in with the v.2.4.0 release, see the Known Bugs section at the top of our notes for a full list. Please continue to let us know about anything new you find once V.2.4.0 does release

Many people have this problem and many probably don't even know they have it. I'm from Italy and on EU servers I get 100-200 sometimes even 250 ping.

With that ping the game becomes almost unplayable.

I have really good internet with fiber and speedtest with 16ms ping, on Fortnite settings I have 20ms ping ot EU. But that's a LIE.

To check your REAL enter a match (for example solo) then  go to settings, Game, HUD, and check ""On"" on the last setting ""Net Debug Status"". You will now see your real ping, don't be surprised if it's way higher than you expected.

How does it make sense that me and many other people from EU (as you can search on google), have the same or sometimes even lower ping to NA-East than to EU!!!!

It doesn't even make sense, there is definitely something wrong going on.

If the team is willing to help I can give more info!

Tried to contact support and no replies, also many people on forum with this problem didn't receive any replies.

PS: In any other games like CS or anything else my usual EU ping is 20-30, max 40.",FortNiteBR

Every single game i'm put into I have to fight and out build so many of them for 2 minutes of pure boredom and stress to get 1 or a few kills off. This game used to just be a casual fun BR game. Never had to worry about any competitiveness about the game.

It's not even fun anymore to play because of this exact reason and alot of my friends and myself are getting so tired of it. And most of us are a 4-5+ k/d players with 200+ wins. We or I are always put into a situation where we have to constantly out build a player who build a 3 story tower in a second and double pump. We always win the fights 7/10 of the time mostly but it just ends with us frustrated that it went on longer than 3 minutes.

That shit isn't fun at all and I end up just stop playing entirely when I encouter it constantly. Always trying to out sweat a sweaty player is not fun. A gunplay lasting longer than 2 mins isn't 0.001% enjoyable. Even when I win the match with 10+ kills I just feel unsatisfied and unhappy with the outcomes I just got put into.

And also I have NEVER been downed by an AR in such a LONG time! I'm always killed by 1-2 pump shots 98% of the time with 200 health. 1% being a sniper and an explosive death.

This is just getting ridiculous. This game already needs a new meta change. Probably just gonna take a break from this game until the new shooting test mode comes out because honestly, that was the one of the most rarest 1 hour of enjoyable fun I had in a long time.

Just putting my thoughts out there because I KNOW there's alot of people who feel the same way as I do but don't wanna voice this shit because of online hate from unknown people. This fuckery needs to be talked about.",FortNiteBR

I personally love Fortnite so I'm really happy we were able to put this together. I hope you feel the same way.

- [Google Play (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.tracker.app)
- [Apple App Store (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tracker-network-game-companion/id1287696482)

The app itself actually supports several popular games right now with varying levels of functionality, and we'll be adding support for more as they become available. My hope is it's the last companion app you ever have to download. :)

The app has several features out of the box, with more coming all the time. We're currently heavily focused on stats, though we may expand at some point.

- **Profile stats:** ""Overview"" mode as well as in-depth filtering.
- **Recent session/matches:** Keep the app running and we'll continually check for updates so you can see how you're doing from match to match.
- **Leaderboards:** See the top players in the world in just about every category you can think of.

We've got plenty ideas for future features, but we'd always love to hear your suggestions or crazy concepts.

Its really rather deflating to log in with your friends for the night and realize half of you have solo challenges and will have to sit out for half an hour or longer while finishing them off or bow out early to make progress on the Battle Pass. 

I think the best solution would be if the place X in a specific mode was just survive to X position in all types so we're not limited on how we can play the game and who we can play with. This would also eliminate the issue of no duo challenges, and make it more pleasant for people who have a strong preference to one matchmaking type without removing any functionality of the challenge themselves. I understand for some games these types of challenges make sense to keep certain modes healthy, but that clearly isn't required here. 

And yes, i know we can re-roll one challenge per day, which is great, but sometimes it can still give you with a queue specific challenge that isn't ideal for how you've planned on playing and that can really make the game feel like a chore some days, which should never be the case.

Perfect. I loved everything about it. But the next battle pass is coming. 

Possible themes...

Vikings - I think this would be great. Swords and Shields for axes. Cool costumes I think it would work.

Superheroes - Although I think there is a lot of superhero stuff out there this would work well. Capes, masks, anything. They could make some cool stuff. 

Space - Aliens, Astronauts. Anything to do with space. 

Samurai - This would be pretty cool too. I think that Fortnite gives off a Samurai type of vibe at times and this could definitely be pulled off. 

Western - Cowboys, Sherifs. This is screaming Shifty Shafts. Come on, this would be awesome. 

For Honor did give me a little inspiration as well as Westworld. What do you guys think? Any other ideas?

Personally I like to play on a lower X &amp; Y sensitivity for more accurate, precise close combat scenarios. However when it comes to building I’d like to have my sensitivity high to be able to build faster. It’ll also help with defending myself when getting shot from behind.

Not only will this benefit console players, but also it’ll help players on PC that play on lower sensitivity.

It was ridiculously overpowered, doing 35 damage per hit for the rare version and 37 for the epic version. People demanded a huge nerf, and they got what they asked for. Unfortunately, because of this big of a nerf, the scoped ar became basically unusable.

Reduced to the same damage as a common pistol and at a much lower fire rate, the Scoped AR has become useless.

The only reason why Scoped AR's are even picked up anymore are as placeholders until you can get a real sniper. They don't even much of a purpose in this game anymore, other than a place holder. All the mid range shots are taken care of with regular M16s, long range with Snipers, and Short range with shotguns.

At this point all I can say is that it needs to either be buffed slightly, like doing 29 damage per hit with the rare version and 31 damage per hit with the epic version, or removed from the game.

3.) you can carry 15 rockets at most

What is currently grinding me, is the weapon swap lag. In close combat matches or even long distance combat, you will want to quickly swap from slot 1 to slot 5 or slot 2 to slot 1 (using default triangle button to swap weapon). So i mean rapidly tapping the button, and you can see it scroll across the slots but then it will always jump back a slot or two. This has caused me to die or miss out on kills, just like the build lag. But recently i have noticed this getting worse and worse. Can this be possibly looked into. I haven't really seen this posted or pointed out much yet, and nothing in the patch notes. 

An upvote for karma would also be nice so i can show a clip of what i mean, as i can't currently post a video for proof.

We just don't see it impact the battlefield in meaningful ways ever UNLIKE Supply Drops and Launch Pads.  Here is what you need to do to fix it.

1.  Give the Cozy Campfire a three story tall smoke animation.  This will do two things to make it more fun.   One, setting it down will be more interesting as you now have to keep it out of the view of opposing players.  Two, as an opposing player it will be more fun to see it set up on the battlefield as it clues us in to enemy positions.

2.  Increase the duration of the item from 25 seconds to 75 seconds.  25 seconds is simply too short to react to by opposing players. 75 seconds will give us time to approach enemy Cozy Campfires in a variety of ways.

3.  Reduce the heal rate of the CC to 1hp per second.  Staying stationary for 20, 30, 40 seconds would be nerve wracking because the potential for enemies to be surrounding you.

There are probably a few more tweaks necessary but those are the big things.  

Will Wright said ""A game is a series of interesting decisions.""

Right now, the launch pad and supply drops give us the most interesting choices in the game.  Make the CC a great item by changing it.

This is a just a little suggestion that I don’t think would be too hard to implement either since a lot of other console games already offer it. 

Edit: You know what Epic. It would actually be even more nice if you just gave us some more customizable graphics settings.

It's so much fun to play in a mode where shotguns don't exist. Where forced shotgun fights are not the only way to play the game correctly. I am going to be insanely sad when Snipers Only goes away, and to be honest...I may not go back to the main Battle Royale game anytime soon. 

After a ton of Sniper Only games, I've found the main game to just be a miserable experience now. It's not fun right now, all the major streamers have VOCALLY said that the current Double Pump situation is horrible to play. Ninja is extremely vocal that he hates it, and only uses it to hope to show Epic they need to fix it. Summit1G today said he's over Fortnite for the same reason I am over Fortnite...THIS ISN'T FUN! And the worst part (And I get Epic is fighting 1,000 bugs right now), but they have not even addressed it. Not vocally, not in any way.

To me, the fix isn't locking gun slots, or anything. But make the interval of changing weapons .5 sec longer than the time it takes to shoot the Tactical Shotgun twice. Meaning swapping Gun 1 to Gun 2 should take .5 sec longer than it takes to shoot two Tactical Shotgun shots. This should apply to any weapon slots. Because even in Snipers Only, Swap spamming the Magnum right now is more efficient than actually trying to snipe someone. Also annoying and ruins the fun of the new mode. 

If there was a significant interval / penalty to swapping guns mid fight then the game could be played and intended the way it was designed. I doubt this is hard to code for Epic, you just introduce a timed variable between swaps. But it would at the least help combat Double Pump and make the Tactical Shotgun relevant for it's entire purpose...to be the fast Shotgun. Right now Double Pump can shoot damn near 3 maybe even 4 times before a Tactical Shotgun can shoot twice at MUCH higher damage. 

I don't know, I think I am with a lot of the big streamers...the game as it sits is losing it's fun the longer Double Pump or Gun Swap spamming continues to exist.

233,Johawnnn,1517434731,7udiaq,31,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7udiaq/double_pumps_please_read/,0,Double Pumps (PLEASE READ),"Let me start by saying double pumps is a fairly difficult skill to master. For the people that are saying it is OP there is a counter to it. How do you counter double pumps? BY BUILDING! If you are the one saying that it is OP you probably aren't a very skilled builder and or need to get better at the game.

Double pumps is a playstyle that let's aggressive players be aggressive. Guess what? The bush is a play-style as well for anyone who wants to play slow and be hidden. So if you're going to remove a play-style from aggressive people YOU MUST remove ALL bushes as well, because all play-styles are acceptable or none of its acceptable HANDS DOWN. 

If you are getting slayed by double pumps constantly you need to get better at the game. I don't see why EPIC is letting the casual community take away a play-style from the 1% of players that have played this game everyday for the past 3-4 months. Some might say it's an exploit and that's fine. But so it rocket riding. With that being said you must take out rocket riding as well because ALL exploits are acceptable or NONE of it is acceptable. 

So to summarize Double pumps is a play-style and it need to be left in because it can be countered. Meanwhile the bush is a playstyle that connot be counter because you cannot see someone In a bush until they've already got you halfway dead. KEEP THE GAME FAIR EPIC. I've played way too many hour into this game to have it be ruined by players that aren't as good as me. If you read this whole thing let me know what you think.",FortNiteBR

After getting screwed by the bug I decided to get back on my M&amp;KB. I have not experienced this bug since. Since it is random, I don't know if I am just lucky. It happened a lot with a controller, but has never happened when using bound keys. Has anyone else noticed this? I know a lot of people frown on M&amp;KB on console, I did too. Then I just spent $20 since it is accepted and my joystick is wonky and both triggers like to stick. Rather than pay $60 for a new controller, I spent a 3rd of that and got a gaming KB&amp;M. There are downfalls to both, but that is for another post. I am just curious if other KB&amp;M players have noticed it too. ",FortNiteBR

I wanted to make a little post on where we are currently at in Fortnite. I have been actively playing Fortnite Br since its release with over 400 hours of game play and 800 wins across solo's/Dou's/Squad's on Xbox. Since the release of 2.3v I haven't had the same urge to play that i had in the past. Playing through hitches is expected with a FTP game and growing population but some of the more recent bugs have rendered the game unplayable and not enjoyable. I wanted to go over a few things that are still running rampant in-game that should be the absolute top priority not gadgets/ skins /guns / new meds/ new pots/ or new POI.


**Current Issues / Bugs in-game** -
- Guns not being able to be picked up after killing someone

- Chests being looted but still showing as unopened so players cant pick up there guns

- Building 80% of a wall/ramp in the ground (became worse with the new POI's)

- Input lag when switch weapons / building pieces / opening doors etc.. (been a real problem for awhile and with each new item/release it gets worse

- Smg's lagging people out when fired early/mid game (mini gun will be interesting)

- infinite reload bug

- Guns being picked up from chests or spawns with 0 ammo

- Trap glitch

- buggy when jumping on certain objects like rocks/cars (getting stuck)

- bullet registration (It is better but still not were it should be)

- Aim assist prioritizing targets (DBNO players)

- Aim assist in general (system feels off and makes it hard to pull off target some times/if you are trying to 
tracking a close moving target)

- phasing through your own build (better but still happens)

- **current building bug that pulls floors out instead of ramps / ramps instead of walls**


Sure there are others these are just some that came to mind while i wrote this. Love the game and the devs but things really need to be halted and reflected on. There is a much needed QOL only update these have been lingering issues for a long time. I am sure there is issues with how quickly this game has grown but the teams priorities shouldn't be with marketing bs releases it need to be with the current issues that these updates have brought.

Bare with me here and read it.,"You find this in chests/locations. You can enter and exit this giant tire which allows you to double your running speed and jump twice as high. It has about the same HP as a wooden wall. I’m still on the fence as to whether you can use guns while rolling. I think it also fits the cartoonish features of Fortnite (bouncing off tires, riding on rpg’s, bush outfits, launch pads, etc)

Pros:
• You can move twice as fast
• It does 100 damage if you run someone over with it (very hard to pull off considering how large and easy it is to shoot down)
• provides slight shielding 

Cons: 
•It’s pretty big so it makes it easy to spot out
•since it’s a tire, it only shields in front and behind you, leaving your sides completely vulnerable.
•it has the same amount HP as a wooden wall so a few shots at and it’s already gone.

I think this is a pretty fair balance?

There could be Epic and Legendary versions where the Legendary has slightly more movement speed, DMG output and armor. ",FortNiteBR

That is to say in ""battle royaLe"" I am level 1 when I was level 71 and in the battle pass it was level 36 I had bought it and now it turns out that it is not bought!

I also bought the founders' package for 40 euros and it has also disappeared and when I enter it puts me that I have to buy it again. I feel cheated!

On the internet I read something from a ghost account for not making the first time the account of Epic Games. I have already tried several methods that I have read by internet and I could not.

I have also sent an email and they have been 24 hours and they have not contacted me yet, if any moderator reads it please help me! I'm desperate.

I am sorry for my bad english.

I also did that to create a second account ""Epic games"" link my PSN after unlinking it to the account of Epic Games main and nothing is no way. It is known that progress has been saved in that first ghost account and there is no way to access it.

I am desperate I have invested many hours of game and money and everything has been lost, please I need a solution :(

Idea:

So it starts off normally, 100 guys (preferably solo mode) skydiving into the map. Guys drop dead and this is where it changes. When there's around 60-70 people alive or lower, another battle bus comes by bringing more people into the map which brings the idea of an endless battle royale. 

Changes to original mode:

- More people 'spawned' into the map through the battle bus.
- Loot, materials (trees, rocks etc) and buildings re spawned every so often for the new players coming
- No storm or smaller map.
Edit: - A live leaderboard to show who is on top sorted by kills or survival time.

Potential Problems:

- Server may not be able to handle this as I don't know the details of how Epic's servers works and if they are scalable to this effect.
- The original players who started off could easily hoard all the items and may well have the best fortress.
- Since there is no storm, the map might be a bit too big for this game mode as it won't force people close together causing fights so the map could be made smaller by sectioning off certain parts of the map i.e. Putting in a prefixed storm which automatically makes the map up to 10-20% smaller.


Records could easily be made here like who lasted the longest, had the most kills, travelled the most etc. before dying.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks


Edit:

Another change: A live leaderboard to show who's on top. Sorted by survival time, amount of kills or a score with both as major factors.",FortNiteBR

She has literally never picked up a console controller since it was a just a [controller pad and the ""1 Start"",""2"" buttons on the Master System.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ts%2BD9U3%2BL._SX522_.jpg)



She watches me, passively, play the PS4 regularly. But, she isn’t particularly interested in my endeavours. I can see her in my peripheral vision, as I'm pulling off sick 360 inward Dolphin flips to score in Rocket League, that she's on the laptop or her phone doing stuff that doesn't include worshipping my finger dexterity (hello!) or admiring my 30+ years of gaming skills, which have been honed like a precision knife; carving out victories in GTA, Battlefield and others, like a Rocket Surgeon.



That was until I downloaded Fortnite.  I join the PVP, I set myself down in a place called 'Tilted Towers' (not that I see any towers off angle in this place) and my life changed forever.



""KIIIIIL HIIIIIIM"" - What the actual Jiminy Cricket was that? It sounded like the battle cry of an Orc, or the death-rattle from a Dragon.
""SHOOOOOOOOT HEEEEEEER"" - It attacks my eardrums again, this time like a thundercrack against sheet metal - the sound, terrifying and ethereal.



I look to my side and the wife is not on the phone, nor the laptop.  She's watching the game and now, it seems - she's also my coach.  This. Is. Different.

""Don't build, just shoot""
""Chase him!""
""Stop going to Tilted Towers you fucking idiot"".  



These sage words of advice and more sprout from my partner/coach/drill sergeants mouth with regular abandon.  

""Hide in the bush""
""Hide in the house""
""Don't shoot him, just hide""
""YOU HAVE A BUSH - BE THE BUSH!""


It continues - slowly I improve, I learn to build better, faster. My aim is on point, my tactics are precise but variable.  I stop picking up the bush consumable... It's only a matter of time now...



Then the day comes. We're sat on the edge of our seats as my old-man hands deftly manipulate the DS4's dual sticks against a wily, last-remaining opponent.  A standoff, AR vs AR... but it's Gold vs Purple and the advantage (and the high ground) is firmly on my side. I can feel it coming - and it does: #1 Victory Royale!!  There's whooping and hollering, we embrace. ""Get in there!"" I exclaim, ""Well done, love!"" my sweetheart replies.


""I want to play it""

Holy Justin Trousersnake - is this happening? My mouth hole forms a perfect, dumb looking 'O' and my eyes are widening.  ""Are...are you sure?"" I reply.


""Yes, I want to play"".  Righto then!  I set her up with a new PSN account (because she's not screwing up my stats!) and we start off into a new an unknown realm of gaming.... partner gaming.  I hand her the DS4, I might as well have passed her the centre stick for a F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.  She looks at my face, then at the controls, then back to my face.  I go through the 2 sticks (and R3/L3), the d-pad, the big fat touch button (does it have an official name? It's called the 'map button' now), the 4 front buttons and the 4 triggers.  I explain what the buttons do in Fortnite, how they change purpose depending on fighting mode or building mode.  


Side-bar.  Do you know how many controls there are on a DS4? If you consider the sticks to have 4 'directions' though it's more than that - there are 23 inputs on my counting.  More than that when you consider that in Fortnite 1 button has different actions based on mode and situation.


""OK, let's work out if you're an inverter or not.  Which way would you push the right stick to look up?""  The stick is pushed up, damn.  Not an inverter, just a 'normy’ - ah well, she can't be perfect I guess but it's fine.  It's fine.  I can live with a normy I'm sure of it. It's fine.


She's in the pregame lobby.  Someone is doing the worm on a fence and a big looking dude is unleashing a full clip of SMG bullets, point blank, into an unconcerned gingerbread man’s dome.  All is normal.  Or so it seems.  The wife’s' avatar seems to have a problem with... well everything.  He's walking slowly but doing a weird running animation.  Like he's trying to empty his pants from an ill-advised shart.  He also seems to have a taken a very, very particular interest in 2 things - a tree, and the ground.


""Darling, look up"" I soothe.  ""I am trying to!"" she sobs.  Hang on. 'Options', 'Settings', 'Game', Invert View: On. ‘Triangle’ to apply. ‘Circle’, ‘circle’, ‘circle’. ""Try that!"".  Bingo – the dirt is quickly replaced by the sky, she's an inverter - I fucking knew she was perfect.


She exits the Party Bus, barely seconds before being forcibly ejected.  Up down, right left, up and right, down and left.  I'm dizzy, I imagine the avatar is spewing his guts up.  She lands in the furthest north-east part of the map ""No one will go here"" she declares. She's right - except for a disappointing hut and a sad Ice-Cream van, it's dead here.  She follows the edge of the storm as it in draws inward, hiding in every hole, sitting in every bush. Slowly creeping around the map with a grey SMG and 5 bandages. 20 players are left.


Now 10 remain.


5 players are left. 4 of them have built forts in opposing compass points of the circle.  All except one player is tooled up to the eyeballs.  RPGs and Sniper bullets fill the air from all directions.  Mini shields are being consumed like Wethers Originals at a retirement home.  Someone tries to pop a Chug Jug.  It's a mistake - 15 seconds in end-game might as well be an hour. 4 players left. 


One player is pushed by the enclosing storm out of his barricades and into the open field.  Some of the remaining opponents seize on this quickly and he's simultaneously exploded and sniped.  Almost immediately afterwards, the (now) bronze medallist is lost to the storm.  We're down to the final 2.  


You might ponder on how I know of the fate of the finalists here - and the answer is simple:  I watched it from the base of the fort of the final guy. In a bush.  The wife sat in the bush for what seemed like hours, watching the battle ensue and seeing her opponents destroy each other.  Then at the end when there were only her and the last enemy, she still sat there - immobilised by the brevity of the situation and complexity of the controls.  Her fine motor skills have never required such movements and her avatar, when she (had to) moved - lurched around the map like a shitting, drunk, blind, deaf vole.


The circle is now impossibly small.  The enemy is perplexed.  He's abandoned his construction and with it, all fear - as he hunts his ravin.  A pregnant pause, he turns to see the bush at the base of his fort.  The bush has a head, but not for long.  'xGamerBoiSnipez2hard69x won the game!'  Declares the screen splash.


""I got 2nd!! wEEEEEEEEEEHOOOOOO"" The wife bellows into the evening air.  ""You certainly did darling, well done! Now, let's just see if you can work out how to move, look, jump, build and shoot the enemies, you might win one, one day!""


And herein lies the issue - she can't learn these things in the game.  The pre-game lobby doesn't hang around long enough to practice and because she cannot aim for shit (Don't make me post a video of it!)  - every encounter with an enemy involves either death or hiding until death.  Resulting in her play style always being 'hide in the bush closest to the edge of the storm'.  Rinse, repeat.  EPIC! Please give us a practice arena - just the pre-game island will do.  Somewhere the beginners can walk around and shoot at... anything really.  I love my wife, but she can't be a bush all her gaming life.  She knows it, I know it, you know it.  Help us! xxx


TL:DR - Wife needs somewhere to practice doing... well.. everything in Fornite BR. Please help us EPIC.

First is Hitreg and Damage Consistency, when im have a gun fight especially close range ill have my shotgun out and so will he but there are times where ive shot him twice and it registers and no numbers come up and i died and ill seee how much health he/she has left and the have 100 health and shield and I find that Bs. Or when im far away got my Ar out and take 60,30,25,40,35,15 in damage and dont die which they should but shouldnt they take the same amount if damage and or not drop off from a range from 60-15
and feel it should be way more consistent.

Secondly, Fucking RPGs There should be no way in hell you should be able to kill someone and not your self if your 5m away from them it is stupid and they take no damage from it either, it thought RPGs were for taking down buildings from far away oh speaking of that how bout we just be inside our house shoot an RPG right above me to open the roof and take no damage from that either but the people who are a panel away will take that damage thats right take 100 damage from that but they take nothing idk how we fix that but it needs to be

Lastly, building okay so idk if this affects pc but definitely console ill be swtiching between the choices, Walls, Floors and Stairs and lets say its on stairs when im switching through ill try and place it and it will place a fuckin floor panel and fuck me over in a gun fight and i have to switch back to stairs if i want them but by that point i need another fucking wall because im being shot a by a guy with a scar and because its would its just gone and ill die  ",FortNiteBR

So, I get to Tilted Towers and I don’t get a good landing spot. My only choice is to hide in a garage if I want to stay alive. To my dismay, the garage has no loot. Shortly after my arrival, a man in a nutcracker suit walks in. He is about to shoot, but I wave at him. He stares for a bit, and actually gives me a gun. I can tell that he is suspicious, because he keeps on turning his head around to look at me. However, I am relieved that he didn’t kill me and there is no way I am going to kill him. 

Throughout the next 5 minutes, we are running through Tilted as a team. He was killing people left and right. We get to a building and someone knocks my partner to low health, but again, he prevails. Being the greedy fellow I am, I pick up most of the loot. After a few seconds, I drop the sniper I got so that he could use it. After all, he got the kill. He motions his head for me to keep it. It was this moment that changed my life forever. 

Something just got to me. I don’t know what it was. As he was motioning his head, I just killed him. I popped a few headshots with an epic pistol THAT HE GAVE ME.

I understand they may have avoided it at the beginning before they knew how large their player-base was going to be, but there’s so many people playing at this point that I don’t think this would negatively impact anybody. A game like Rocket League has had 1, 2, 3, and 4 player team modes from the beginning and it makes it possible for any variety of my friends and I to play a balanced game together. 

Sorry if this comes off as whiny or whatever but I just figured this would provide a better experience for more players. Either way we’ll continue to play, but I feel like this would be a great quality of life update. 

Edit: just wanted to clarify that we play no fill because any time we try fill the player ends up being useless or goes to a different area. Also, we win a fair bit (about 20 times). I’m not worried about winning. Just wanted another option for 3 person squads like mine. ",FortNiteBR

First of all I want to thank you for every useful tip for this wonderful game. Unfortunately as I've noticed, I'm not able to use them all, even if I'm aware of game mechanics (thanks to you), due to very high stress level during the game. I always kept doing the same mistakes over and over again. It wasn't a problem until I realise that thanks to you guys I am pretty aware of the gameplay and I can provide very useful tips to my friends when I'm spectating.Yesterday we were playing duos with my friend and as usual I've been downed first. Then when I was spectating, I was able to provide him really good hints (like waiting in the cover until they were distracted, building when they're building to avoid detection, using jump pad to quickly approach them) despite the fact that he was new to the game he eventually defeated both of our enemies and have won glorious victory royale. But I wish I could think like that when I'm actually playing. I guess it has something to do with high stress level and I'm easily targeted beacause I always panic when somebody approach me. Should I play more aggressive? Curently I only have won two times in solo but the more I think of that the more I think it was just my luck. Is this stress feeling will ever let go? I will be very grateful for any tips for dealing this issue.",FortNiteBR

After this Dakotaz goes a childish rampage dissing rhino directly by name and threatening to release private conversations the two of them had and basically ruin his career as a YouTuber.

Edit: Dakotaz is an amazing Fortnite player and makes great content as well and is normally fun to watch. But I just fee that he MASSIVELY overreacted to rhino dissing his tree tip.

If we could have one custom character skin for winning players, and then have color accents on it to represent win count... that would be amazing. You could be intimidating when a player spots you and sees immediately that you've won x number of games.

For example, maybe we could have a Ninja outfit and then have the accent color represent our ""win rank"". It could work based on the color tiers already in the game.

When I play solo I’ll go tilted or pleasant or salty every game, and usually get 2-4 kills right off the bat and then I get looted up and leave. Why are people such scaredy cats?

Edit: past 11 drops now... they just spread out over big wide open areas with nothing but flat land or bare mountains as far as the eye can see :( I keep dropping with them because I’m a team player but damn, they never win, I’m always left to play solo squads within 3 minutes of the drop...

Edit: I’m gonna have a fucking aneurism. Every fucking drop, all 3 drop as soon as the timer starts, one goes in every cardinal direction and I’m left to choose one to drop with, they get killed instantly and I’m left to fend for myself. Why is everyone so bad at this game? I’m not going to play squads anymore because it’s been 15 drops that were over before they even started. ",FortNiteBR

This game could be so much better if it was more strategic with more variance in the guns. I get that you like shotguns, that's fine. Everyone does. They are OP and can one shot you, at worst two shot you. But what's wrong with rewarding sustained aim? At making SMGs and pistols actually useful at close range?

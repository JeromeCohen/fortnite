As a player that started before there were seasons, this game has become un-fun. I think if Epic vaults most of the items I list, Fortnite would be a more fun and challenging experience. If you don't like the direction Fortnite is heading in like a lot of players, let your voice be heard. (Posts keep getting removed due to flair.)

Items that need vaulted:

- Dynamite
 A rediculous explosive that levels entire buildings and has a  stupid blast radius. Spammable
- Double Barrel
A casual player can look at you anf kill you in 2 shots without having good accuracy
- Grappling Hook
Instant high ground without the effort of counter building to retake high ground.
- Quad launcher
Another spammable explosive that doesn't take a lot of effort to get a kill or destroy someone's base.
- Turrets
Nothing needs to be said about the turret. Get it out. 
- Rift to go 
A cop out for players who just run from engagements. Increase portal duration to give chase if they do stay in the game.
- compact smg 
A SMG with a 40 round clip that shreds through building pieces. Spammable. People need to learn how to destroy a wall/ floor, edit it, and outplay your opponent.

Fortnite used to be about out-playing your opponent with strategy. Now it's a spamfest of explosives and SMGs. The RPG, grenade launcher and frags were enough. This game just isn't fun anymore.",FortNiteBR

This game is constantly going in the wrong direction and turrets were the final straw. Fortnite isn’t fun anymore, it’s frustrating. We get it epic, you want to decrease the skill gap so the bots can continue playing/spending money on your game, but this just wasn’t it chief. It requires absolutely no skill whatsoever to build up, place a turret, and hold fire on an enemy until they either run out of mats from spam building or just accept their death. If you don’t have height advantage on the turret it’s impossible to shoot the person manning it, and even if you somehow find time to switch to your gun and try to break the turret you’ll just get lasered before your second bullet even leaves the barrel. Until these turrets are removed, I, along with many of my friends,will be uninstalling.

Game.,"You heard me right folks, Fortnite is going down the tubes and Epic is killing it themselves. Think about it, They've added Balloons,Heavy AR,Turret,Dynamite,Zombies, etc. now tell me how do you fell about all of those things I just listed? Any of them seem too OP, useless, or maybe if just plain stupid? They've also made many changes to the game that we all absolutely hated including damage changes, game play changes, and overall many things to close the skill gap for absolutely no reason. I'm Starting to think Epic must either have a gas leak in their buildings or they must really not like being a successful company. Here's my suggestion to fix these problems. They should do a test server almost like what Blizzard does for Overwatch that allows you to test out new heroes and fixes before they are released in game to see how they settle with the community. Instead of Epic just slapping us in the face with a major change we could at least test it out a week before and give feedback to let them know how we feel on the change. Another thing would be to actually listen to the community! By that I don't mean make a concept into a real skin. No when we say we want something changed change it! We don't like the turret either do a hard nerf or get rid of it. Don't do things based off of what you guys THINK is good and will eventually settle. I don't mean to sound bratty but do as we say. We are the players who are the only ones playing it and your only goal is to have us enjoy playing it. If we all asked to be able to be invincible then let us be invincible. One more thing please stop shoving new LTM's and weapons down our gullets like it's Thanksgiving dinner. The game isn't stale and we never craved for a new weapon so why go and do it? Let alone add it all for a LTM like what? They added Grappler,Six Shooter,Dynamite,Turret and probably another one all for an LTM. Buddy we don't care for LTM's. Last thing, Please stop trying to close the skill gap there is no reason too because new players understand that others are better so why try to even their skill level with broken weapons that take zero skill (Turret,Dynamite,HeavyAR). It's stupid and brings in new players but drives away older ones.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR  

Actually listen to us. (NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY. We aren't just complaining because we died, we're complaining because even a chimp could differentiate whether you should add 

Add a test server a week before you guys add a weapon or change something game play wise

Stop messing with the skill gap.

Thoroughly think next time before you do something to the game ",FortNiteBR

So I've compiled a list of changes I've noticed from the fanbase and some personal suggestions.

Guns/Items:
•Buff the Pump and bring back Double Pump
•Remove useless and boring guns (i.e. Silenced Assault Rifle, Dynamite, Chillers, etc)
•Nerf the Port-A-Fortress by not having it pre-built, buff the Port-A-Fort to be pre-built
•Bring back Bouncers
•Add a shield/health bonus per kill
•Vault Turrets
•Bring back some skins per holiday but keep some rare for the 'OGs'
•Buff P90 (Only if Double Pump comes out again) for both an easy strategy (Spray and Pray) and a skilled strategy (Double Pump)

Map:
•Buff the loot in certain edge locations to increase player spread
•Patch map glitches
•Bring back the 'Snowdome/Hogwarts/Broken Houses'

Playstyle:
•Buff Mats and Mat Cap

I just think that everyone should get their own lobby for the game to remain fair, and that everyone feels that they\`re not being hurt in any way, just like controller players got separated from what was decided it was unfair.

First of all, I cannot turn my mouse acceleration or motion blur off. That\`s a nightmare which has no way around.

Secondly, the input delay and performance of the PS4 doesn\`t even begin to compare to a PC, let alone a 3000 dollar one. In conclusion people on PC can just have better aim and build faster.

I like to think of myself as a decent player who really enjoys the game, but I grind my ass off, play smartely as I can, but when I face someone with a better machine than me, I don\`t stand a chance. Of course there are better people than me, not everyone is just better because of their computers. But sometimes you can clearly see the difference in performance, its just not fair at all.

All I\`m asking for is a console mouse lobby, with xbox mouse support coming in we\`ll surely have enough players for it to work, or maybe a statement from Epic regarding this issue, to see where they are going with this situation. I would very much like to know.

I'm not going to pretend like I know more than the developers of the game, but sometimes the community does know better.

There are too many items in the game, some with unnecessarily multiple grades, and the more items you add the worse the RNG becomes.

In my very humble opinion (and I hope the community chips in with their input as well);

1. Vault the following:
   1. Turrets
   2. Bush
   3. Dynamites (Rather have the C4's return)
   4. Scoped Assault Rifle
   5. Chillers
   6. Suppressed Pistols
   7. Double Barrel Shotgun
   8. Thermal Scoped Assault Rifle
2. Lower the number of grades of the following weapons:
   1. Six shooter (down to Epic/Blue only)
   2. Pistols (Gray/Green)
   3. Rocket Launcher (Do we really need 100dmg, 105 and 110?)
   4. Grenade Launcher (Do we really need 110dmg, 116 and 121?)

I understand the developers are leaning towards finding a counter for building - but why so aggressive? It only ruins the game and makes it another 3rd person shooter. With turrets and dynamites this isn't a counter to building - it completely destroys that aspect of the game, and it is very clear which direction the game is going based on the last additions.

If you are so keen to make this game more aggressive, how about awarding 15 shield &amp; hp per kill and significantly increasing the drop rate of Launch Pads and Rift-To-Go's?

Finally, the last update which stated that All shotguns will do a minimum of 3 pellets per hit only amplifies what I said earlier; reducing the skill gap requirement of the game. I'm one of those that greatly complained about my pump doing 9 damage but I understood and knew that it was because of my aim, ping, and other aspects NOT because the weapon is broken.

&amp;#x200B;

I sincerely hope this does not get removed/locked/deleted like a previous post I made. I mean this as a constructive, positive please to the developers of the game, from someone who spends 8+ hours a day playing because I truly love this game.

&amp;#x200B;

We have made some changes to help control the volume of suggestion posts and overall posts that have been sore spots or perceived as low effort by the community. We understand that some users will not be happy with this change and it is not a change that we took lightly. We thoroughly discussed this change within the mod team and believe that it is the best choice going forward.

##### Suggestion Guidelines Additions:

 - All suggestions must go into a text post alongside a description of your suggestion. If the description of the suggestion is not long enough to encourage a valid discussion, then it will be removed. You can provide a link to an image, gif, or video in your post via imgur or a similar service, but we do not allow link shorteners. 

Recently there have been a lot of ‘spammy &amp; low quality’ suggestions and that has been brought to our attention by users of the subreddit. This is one of the main reasons why we’re enforcing this change, we want r/FortniteBR to be a place for everybody to be able to discuss the game and share their ideas. But when it gets to the point that our users are unhappy with the suggestion content that was being posted, we felt like this was a good change that will help the subreddit.

##### Discussion Guidelines Additions:

 - Posts that are only images of in-game elements (weapons, items, etc) must be in a text post with a description.

Much like the above change to the Suggestion Guidelines, the community has voiced concerns that a lot of posts are ‘spammy &amp; low quality’ because they are just an image of some element in Fortnite that requires no effort to post and does not leave much room for engaging discussion.

 - No posts where the sole focus is nostalgia. (For example: “Remember when…?” or “Remember X item?”)

There are always a lot of these posts floating around the subreddit and it just seems like these nostalgia posts are posted and reposted just to earn some easy karma rather than encouraging relevant discussions.

This way the casuals can play the game the way they like and the hardcore gamers can play the game the way they like. 

The problem is that this is not true. That's what everyone thought for overwatch and holy shit was that a bad idea. Ranked modes just increase toxicity. A toxic person who only complains doesn't stop being toxic because you created a system to rank them. Instead when they aren't ranked as high as they would like,  they will become more toxic and start complaining about why the system is unfair. 

There is no way around this. Toxicity doesn't arise from not having a ranked mode. Toxicity arises because players feel like they are placed in situations where there is nothing they can do regardless of skill level. This can be because a game has too much rng, the game hard counters mechanically skillful play with easy strats/items/heroes or the game itself is just too difficult for a player. Just like overwatch and league of legends, the problem with fortnite is that the game has such a steep learning curve that it is impossible to balance for bad players, ok players, good players and great players at the same time. There is no difference in my mind between fortnite turret and overwatch Brigitte. They are both hammers used by the dev team to flatten the skill curve to the detriment of players that have spent hundreds to thousands of hours trying to get better at the mechanical aspects of the game. Having a ranked mode is not going to fix that. ",FortNiteBR

Rather than beginning Season 7 and getting my new skins, random dances and 30 throw up emotes that I've never used once, I'd rather Epic delayed the release of Season 7 and make their game more stable. 

&amp;#x200B;

This could also be a time for them to analyse the games direction and meta. At the time, when double pump was nerfed, it was needed. 1 pump could do 200+ damage headshot. However, if they analysed the current state of the game, what use is a pump doing 80 damage headshot? Even if you could double pump, and get 2 headshots, it would only be 160 damage. They could analyse this and see that with the current state of the game, the delay could be removed and a slight increase. I know they are updating shotguns in the next patch but it's just an example.

1- you shouldn't build high with no risk = when you can shoot them down and get free shots on the target

2- you don't waste mats on building high and being able to take high ground (shots) = relates to 1

3- made 3rd parties common = I can kinda agree with this for a little bit but that doesn't mean there is no counters (like disengaging, or waiting for another party to come and let the 2 teams fight it out etc.., defensive mechanics is too good now to kinda care about third parties if you play smart.)

4- ""tHeRe sHoUlD bE a rIsK tO rEpOsitioning"" = I get that its a BR game but people shouldn't be looking for more RNG right?!

5- People running away = ARE YOU SERIOUS GUYS?

i am playing fortnite since Season 1 day 1 . I really enjoyed it up until Season 6 .

In my opinion this is the worst Season so far. 

Unnecessary change after unnecessary change instead of fixing what we allready have. 

The Mindset is just wrong . Why whould you care about anything new in the game if you are suffering from an already unbalanced item . 

It all began with the chill traps . What are they supposed to do . You can joke around and have fun with them for 1 or 2 games but thats it. Most of the time you cant use them very effectively. And even if you could there are so many better ideas for an ice trap in fortnite. 

After that we get the Zombies . Nobody liked them . The game just wasnt working properly . Unnecessary . 

Next change glider redeploy . Well even if the community is split on this i believe this is not the right kind of mobility that should have never been added to the game . 

With Balloons coming next we get another fancy item that is just not worth implementing to the game . The use of it is just stupid . 

And now ladies and gentlemen on top of all this epic thinks its a good idea to add the turret to the game . What a phenomenal gaming experience. Legendary rarity and you find it more often then traps and campfires in EVERY game.  No hitbox . No bloom . How can this past any test before it gets into the game . Who is testing new items ? 

Last but not least we get dynamite . Why would you add such an item after these past changes . It just puts oil into the fire . Unnecessary and Embarassing . 

Thats why blizzard is publisher of the year i guess. 

But to end the negative points let me add some postive ones too . 

They stated that the (pump)-shotguns are going to get more consistency and damage which is great.(way too late but still.)

Also they want to nerf the turret . ( even though they are not adressing the spawn rate which is the biggest problem ) 

&amp;#x200B;

What are you guys thinking ?  This is not ment to hate on fortnite this is just criticism that comes from love to the game . 

I hope the End of Season 6 /Season 7 gets better.

You just couldn't/refused to adapt. I don't care if I get downvoted into oblivion, I need to say this.
This game is heavily rng/luck based, but it was nice to have a reliable way out of a bad situation. It's battle royale, 100 players, you're going to get 3rd partied, stop complaining and adapt. It made the game more exciting. It gave lower level players a chance against players at an unachievable level. I don't see the good in a skills gap, it just means high level players can remain untouched, while people like me writhe in unending failure.  I've been playing since season 2-3 and have yet to ""git gud"". I have played almost 700 matches of solo and only have about 1-2 win(s) over my entire solo career that I got from pure luck. What about that says that this game is in a perfect state?  I have tried everything I can possibly think of and I still have yet to make any progress. But with glider redeploy I was averaging 3 to 4 kills almost every single game and working towards a win, whereas before, I was lucky to get 1 kill every 5 games. The game in its current state has provided nothing but rage, frustration, and defeat. That's not mentioning the fact that the game has become incredibly slow ever since it was taken out.  Now, what I mean by that is, there were more people alive for longer, leading to more action filled games, whereas now, the majority of the match, the players that weren't killed instantly because of bad luck, are hiding in their one by ones sniping at each other because they're too afraid to f******* move. What is SO fun about that?

On another note, I do have an idea that would solve this issue for both sides:

-Classic And Special-

I suggested this when glider re-deploy was taken out, to have both a classic and a special option for Solo, duos, and squads. Unfortunately, my posts either got taken down, or my comments never got the attention they needed. Classic would be classic battle royale for people who want that type of experience as flawed as I may see it. Special would include experimental features such as glider redeploy and anything they decide to add/test in the future. 
I personally like this idea because it satisfies both sides of the argument. The people who want the classic battle royale experience have their own lobbies/servers for it,  The people who enjoyed glider I deploy and are open to new features have their own lobbies/servers for that.
A lot of pros are suggesting that glider redeploy have a limit, but I personally feel like this wouldn't be as fun as it already was. The way I saw it, there was nothing wrong with it, the only bad thing about it was that there was no option to go back to classic battle royale, which I agree has its place.

TL;DR - Classic Battle royale has it's place, but so does glider redeploy. So why not have both as separate modes?",FortNiteBR

Its not that hard to avoid it, you literally have a dude sitting in a chair spamming at you for 6 seconds. Emphasizing on the sitting down part, the dude is static,not moving at all. Movement and mobility is probably the biggest aspect to Fortnite yet you are complaining about someone who is handicapping himself while you can move around and flank him from numerous sides. Not to mention that most of the time you have a clear view of him while he doesnt (if youre not braindead and keep staying in his sight for him to shoot you for eternity of course) . There are tons of ways to get around it.   


Turret on top of you? Get under it or get inside the building its on.Guess what? he cant shoot you anymore,wow.

Turret on plain ground? Keep building to close the distance,force an overheat. Once you're close he will either have to bail out or keep sitting there like an idiot.

Turret below you? Let him stay below you, the turret has a limited elevation angle. If its wrecking down your building, let him, it will overheat, then make your move.

Most importantly, use natural cover which is indestructible. Move around, dont stay in the same place. Get out of its sight.

Stop building to get the highground, the dude isnt going anywhere. Build to get to natural cover. 

Weapons? High damage single shots like snipers or deagles. Pop out,shoot,change positions,rinse and repeat. Explosives are probably the best, ones that can be fired or thrown behind cover.  
I think youve seen the post that reach hot where a dude threw a plunger to the guy in a turret. You know why he could do that? Because he was throwing it behind cover, natural cover which is indestructible.

Stop trying to fight it like its a normal player.Its a machine gun strapped on a chair which cant fire infinitely without risking overheating with limited movement. Im sure you can wrap you head around how to counter it, after all you are the dudes that can win victory royales with crazy 360 atv trickshots.",FortNiteBR

The thing is that tournament games and pub games are very hard to balance in a game like this, and almost all of us can agree that pub games being more enjoyable is the better option.  
  
 Also, no matter how hard they try to do this, almost all of the players in tournaments will always play extrermely defensive and with caution since so much is at stake.  
  
 So it's either they try to make pub games fun like they used to be in S3 or near the end in S4, or keep trying to make tournament games more enjoyable to watch (which continuously fails to give any results and will probably destroy the game if it continues at this pace).  
  
P.S. this is just my opinion so please take it with a grain of salt. However, I really think that a civil discussion about the current state of the game will be beneficial for everyone who plays it. ",FortNiteBR

It’s good for the game, it will keep it fresh season after season so it stays fun. But new metas take time to adjust. We’ve killed Epics solution to a stalled out mid game in glider redeploy, now we’re back to never seeing another player for 5-10 minutes. We killed guided missiles. And now we’re getting real close to killing another meta changer in the turrets. 

Counters for everything in the game exist, even turrets. Toss a port a fort/fortress on it to stall, spread your party out, use one of the many mobility tools in the game, use a stink bomb for the first time in your life, or just play smart and fall back. If the turret starts following you let me know because I’ll pick up a pitchfork too. Let the game change, it would have worked out fine. Turrets would have been a strong counter to glider redeploy, and guided missiles would have been a great counter for turrets. Criticism is fine. Give reasonable fixes, epic has used community suggested nerfs in the past. But asking for new items to be removed immediately will just kill the game. 

Building shouldn’t be the only way to win this game and I’m thrilled Epic is pulling away from the “just build” mentality that has made this game stall out. When was the last time this game had a big shift in gameplay? Season 3 when people started building more? That shift in gameplay gave this game its popularity, so let it happen again. ",FortNiteBR

Now with every patch I play less and less. I love Fortnite, and the build mechanics are something that I will never forget being available in a shooter, but I am burnt out of BR. I m tired of dying to RNG loot, storm luck or just casual design in general. It is fun and tolerable for a while, but if this game wants any longevity competitively we must branch away from the BR formula.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am recommending is a objective based game mode featuring a create a class system, and skill based match making that alleviates a lot of the RNG grievances I have with the game. Objectives prevent 1 by 1 camping, and spawning with mats reduces the boring farming phases of the game. In recent days I've had alot of fun with Disco Domination and the Roblox game [Strucid](https://www.roblox.com/games/2377868063/Strucid-Alpha) , which I feel implements these ideas very well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epic adds new content almost every week. There is not much harm that could happen with experimenting with these playlists. Even if it is with the top players at first. Now there will be an option to test your skill, or fool around in the BR map just having fun. I feel that the player base is large enough that these changes will not affect queue times too much, and from the overall state of the community I believe they will be well received.",FortNiteBR

* Time To Overheat

 * Reduced from 10 seconds to 6 seconds

We’ll also be making additional changes in the upcoming v6.31 update. We are going to adjust the collision volume to make it easier to land shots against whoever is occupying the Mounted Turret as well as change the Turret’s floor to take structure damage instead of player damage.

The Clueless one - You and two other teammates mark a Greasy drop, he chooses to drop Tilted and go on a solo mission. Exclusively wears the default skin. Does not have a mic. Somehow stays alive longer than you even though you dropped with your team.

2. The Mexican - Doesn't speak a lick of english. Mic is blaring at 100 volume. You can hear his whole family talking in the background. 

3. The Scared one - You and him both mark to go Pleasant. You've got a perfect landing but you see two other teams landing and need other teammates to help. He decides that there are too many teams and drops on the mountain with one chest and leaves you alone to die in Pleasant. You eventually die, he decides to not contest Pleasant and you spectate him on the run for the rest of the game, doing his best to avoid every team.

4. The 9 year old - Doesn't say a word, but follows you to drop Retail. He lands at the opposite end from you. He gets knocked and screams for you to come help him, even though he knows it's a suicide mission to run that far to get the res. Says the guy he fought is one shot. You tunnel your way over and use every single mat whilst getting beamed by both the left and right. Meanwhile he's still screaming for you to get the res. You get in his house and 1v1 the guy who knocked the 9 year old. You shoot him 3 times with a grey AR and you both die.



5. The Miscalculated Dropper - you and your squad decide to drop late to Westworld, he jumps out at the beginning over Lazy Links. You gather a pump, smg and Ar but another player hits both of his double barrel shots on you and knocks you. The Miscalculated Dropper drops right on you and tries to res you. He is likely to not be able to hear footsteps and not wall off when he's reviving you.

6. The Mic one - Is happy that he also found someone with a mic. Very enthusiastic that he has a teammate with a mic and is very optimistic that the squad will win. He dies off spawn and gets full killed. Doesn't say goodbye or spectate you even though you are alive.

7. The God - Has a mic and gives good callouts. Always shares heals/ammo/mats. Stops talking as much when he realizes you got knocked off spawn. Takes out a whole squad by himself. Doesn't say a single word. Once he spots a team he goes off running and assumes you're right behind him. Carries you to a 30 kill squad win with you only getting one lucky grenade kill. You send him a friend request. He never accepts.",FortNiteBR

\- We don't need new items every week! Don't feel like you need to stretch yourself and add unnecessary items/guns   
 (ex: mounted turret, dynamite, maybe balloons and chillers?)

\- Please stop adding new skins to files and actually bring unreleased skins to the game. There are skins that were added to the files a month ago that we still haven't seen!

\- Bring back bounce pads PLEASE.. they made the game super fun, and didn't unfairly increase mobility

\- Shotgun buffs are apparently coming in v6.31, so great, we really need that

\- Plan your LTMs a little more, don't rush them: mini bullets and rockets are in Wild West, a mode without explosives or light ammo weapons.

\- DO NOT BRING IN AN AERIAL VEHICLE, please don't fr tho

\- And most importantly:

Please take action against clickbaiters.

What do I do now?,"I just killed a player for the win in a 2v1, and he invited me to a party afterwards. I enjoy hearing what salty players have to say, so i joined the party. 

This kid informed me that he was going to DDOS me, and then my internet went down on all my devices. It took about an hour of calling xbox support and my ISP to get my internet working again. 

It was extremely frustrating that i had to spend my limited time fixing my internet instead of playing. 

My room mates were also using the internet, and were also kicked off.

I have the exact gamertags of the player, and his friend who DDOS’ed me, and i’m wondering what i can do? This has to be a bannable offense right? It not only affected me, but also my room mates who were doing school work. I had to apologize to them and explain what happened and it felt ridiculous. they can’t do their school work right now because i killed a kid in a video game and he got really mad about it. Come on.

Now i know never to join a random party on xbox again, but aside from reporting them through the xbox, is there anything i can do against these toxic players? This whole situation was really annoying, and it makes me sad that when i’m trying to enjoy a video game, other players are so viscously salty they are doing things like this, and i’m unlucky enough to run into them. 

I have a screen shot of their gamertags, and i messaged them saying i was going to do everything i could to get them in trouble for this. I received a com ban because i was a bit... upset when i was messaging them. They replied saying they didn’t DDOS my internet, but when i joined the party the kid straight up told me he was DDOSing me. 

Reddit please help me deliver justice upon these players, and save other from the horrors of a DDOS attack. ",FortNiteBR

Epic ignores it all. Somebody posts on the normal Fortnite sub about changes they should add to team rumble and the very next patch it gets added(before 9.1 content update somebody asked for equal amount of hotspots on each side, epic made a solution in 2 days. There was a concept for 100% chest spawn, reduction of sileneced pistol spawns and stuff like that and it got added the very next patch.)

I understand that Team Rumble is played by the majority of the players and that we on this sub are probably &lt;0.5% of the player base. Still i don’t think it is nice to be ignored.

I like the suppressed but using a sniper should reveal your location. The heavy is just too much and the semi is very unreliable.  

Since epic is rethinking the amount of snipers the most likely scenario is that the hunting will get vaulted and the semi will be buffed. But I'd much rather have the previously stated solution",FortniteCompetitive

It's a major disadvantage to not be able to take anyone's wall (or even defend your own for that matter) and no one likes playing with high latency. 

Now today, I'm not going to talk about why Epic should have more servers for us central players, or cry about my high ping (50-70), I'm just curious as to why my ping was 5-10 during the unvaulting event.

Ping is naturally lower when there are less players in the lobby, for example creative and team rumble. I understand that. 

However, In the unvaulting event, they didn't take us to our own server, or reduce the amount of players at all, It was simply just in another location on the map. (I'm pretty sure I heard it was way above *or below* Salty. Not going into that discussion.)

I'm just simply curious as to why it was so much lower, and how epic could achieve this low latency consistently for those of us who don't live on the server.",FortniteCompetitive

10,jforjeenius,1559339185,bvdcfe,49,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bvdcfe/arena_on_console_fortnite_is_shit_because_i_am/,252,Arena on console Fortnite is shit because I am forced to play against mouse and keyboard players. When I say I want siphon and faster material in pubs (where I can play against other console players) I get told to play arena. Why does Epic keep saying they are trying to “include all play styles”?,"I’ll start by saying I have drastically stopped playing Fortnite as much as I used to. I played this game every fucking day for over a year, it was absurd. I’ve never played a game like I played Fortnite. None of my friends play anymore. We all started in season 1. I play on an original Xbox one with a normal controller.

People always say “oh you were fine with the game before they put in siphon and fast farming”. Yeah, I was. Then I realized the game is way better with those settings. Now I hate the current settings of normal playlists. I spend 5 minutes every game farming wood. I don’t understand why nobody at Epic understands this, but HITTING A TREE FOR 5+ MINUTES EVERY GAME IS BORING AS FUCK. Oh and don’t even bother attempting to farm brick or metal unless you’re at a few specific POIs that have an abundance of these materials and you want to sit there farming for even more time.

Anyway, I was fine with playing in Arena when I first started. I loved playing with siphon and fast farming and I was having a great time. Then I got into the competitive 300+ point leagues. I am clearly no longer playing against console players. As I said before, I play on an original Xbox one with a normal controller. How the fuck is me on my original Xbox one fighting some person on a desktop with mouse, keyboard, and the ability to mod their computer to the point where it is 100x as powerful as my Xbox even put in the same sentence as “competitive”? 

It’s absurd that epic keeps saying “we want to make it so anyone’s playstyle can succeed” or whatever the hell they keep saying. They clearly don’t give a fuck. They want to keep as many people playing their game as possible, but they’re fucking up. They’re losing people like my friends and I who have played this game since it began and are no longer playing.

All I ask is to at least separate controller from keyboard and mouse in arena. Until this happens I don’t see myself or my friends ever playing as much as I used to. I understand why Epic would prefer to please the young children who pump money from their parents credit cards into the game, but it’s a shame.",FortniteCompetitive
11,Voluxe,1559338412,bvd7gw,61,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bvd7gw/epics_reasoning_behind_the_fov_slider_is/,525,Epic's reasoning behind the FOV Slider is horrendous. Let me help EVERY one of you understand.,"    Q: /u/Kessarean: Will FOV see a reconsideration?
    
    A: We have no plans to implement an FOV slider. One of our major goals for competitive Fortnite is to support players in their journey to be able to become stars and build their own audiences around awesome performances and personas. Part of that goal means listening to the desires of their viewers, and stepping in when necessary. In this case, players were indicating they felt required to play with stretched resolution (or increased FOV) in order to remain competitive, and fans said that it was a negative experience to watch.

The ones who expressed negativity towards increased FOV did so against STRETCHED *not* FOV itself.

A lot of people might find players and streamers using stretched to not be visually appealing, but they have NEVER seen Fortnite with FOV WITHOUT the stretched character models and somewhat ""wonky"" looks.  


We can have stretched WITHOUT the cost of poor character models and sprites being stretched and looking wonky.

You can give people an actual choice to adjust their FOV based on how far the distance is between the actual player and the monitor of use. This way, no player has to actively play on something that actually making them motion sick. Epic's stance is that 80 FOV is a middleground, so that everyone that actually feel ill from it **just have to deal with it**.   


Well, the average shoe size in the US is a 9. Should we just not make shoes for everyone below and above this threshold?  
They can ""just deal with it"". Feet hurts from having too large feet? Too bad. **CRANK THEM IN!** Feet too small for the shoes? Fill the shoes with news paper and then step in. **DEAL WITH IT**.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, it's fucking pathetic.

Do a 90 turn while you can, even your ***bot*** can crank 90s.

This whole AMA you held today was a joke and an embarrassment for both the people working at Epic and us, the players. The route you are on for this game is depressing, when you actually want to merge casual and competitive play.  


I'm going to end this by repeating myself.

***Honestly, it's fucking pathetic***.

They don’t care how many people want to change their resolution, because of little Timmy thinks Ninjas FOV looks ugly, then Ninja shouldn’t be able to use it. This is such a bs excuse that I can’t even fathom what is going through the devs’ heads. 

If a streamer wants to change their FOV, let them! If they are worried about the viewers experience, THEY DON’T HAVE TO USE IT! You shouldn’t force people you use one FOV just because you don’t want them to loose viewers. Ridiculous",FortniteCompetitive

I still feel they aren't telling the the genuine truth. This answer pretty much states that they won't add an FOV slider because of stretched resolution. FOV slider is **not** stretched resolution. The viewing experience will not be as degraded (based off of numerous videos in both STW and BR versions of Fortnite where the FOV (via a slider) was used to change field of view). 

No one was 'forced' to play stretched and many didn't. As it stands right now, we are **forced** to play on 80 FoV. With a slider, everyone has the **option** to play on what they feel most comfortable on.

I appreciate Epic taking the time to respond to our questions and hold this AMA. There has been a lot of meaningful feedback as well as this being a step in the right direction, but this answer wasn't satisfying and was pretty much a restatement of what they said before, which people were dissatisfied with and rightfully so.",FortniteCompetitive

Welcome to today’s Competitive AMA. Let’s introduce who will be answering your questions today.

/u/EpicEricSW - Design

/u/skyzyn - Competitive Design

/u/EpicMFG - Spectating and Broadcast

/u/EpicLoomin - Competitive Operations

/u/EpicEquinox - Competitive Analytics

/u/JustMooney1 - Community

You gave us some great questions to start off with. So let’s dive right into those questions/answers.

**Q: /u/JorisR94: Are you guys considering a separate loot pool for Arena/competitive?**

A: Not at the present time. 

Having the same core battle royale game played by players of all skill levels is healthy for the overall state of the game and keeps competition open, approachable, and for both players and viewers.

We aim at one game, however we occasionally make exceptions (such as Siphon), but our threshold for branching core gameplay is very high. It's up to us to find new directions for balance that reward players at every skill level, while not creating negative experiences for different groups. Even as Epic focuses on competitions where all are welcome to play in familiar ways, we’ll also be continuing to add tools that will allow players to customize their experience to fit their personal preferences and the way they would most like to play. 

**Q: /u/pauperdown: How do you see the future of Arena? Do you have any plans on adding new divisions and incentives like leaderboards and small prizes, so Arena feels more competitive?**

A: We are currently working on a refresh of Arena, with an emphasis around providing more high quality, exciting matches and tournaments with meaningful stakes. 'Hype' will become more like a currency which you use to enter tournaments and participate in higher difficulty Arena matches, with top overall performers for the season represented on a leaderboard. Seasonal rewards are on the roadmap as well for future iterations of Arena.

We also want to get back to running nightly (non-prized) tournaments on a regular basis, across a wider variety of team sizes &amp; game modes. Having Hype as rewards for placements in these tournaments will help provide some meaning and motivation behind each competition, even when cash isn't on the line.

**Q: @CowboyFN_: How does Storm Surge work now? What circle does it activate? How many people have to be alive at what circle for it to activate? Sometimes you get a warning and sometimes it's active. Why is this?**
A: First a little history - Storm Surge was initially added to help in competitive matches where an unusual number of players were still around and server performance would degrade. Ultimately having less players in a match directly impacts this, and our goal is to ride the line between minimal gameplay impact while maintaining a playable server framerate. Siphon was also added to help balance the risk/reward of eliminating another player - primarily to help reduce turtling &amp; encourage a healthier ‘elimination curve’.

To answer your specific questions, storm surge activates if the number of players in a match is higher than the values designated below at each storm phase. Surge will deal 25 damage to each player under the damage threshold, and this damage occurs every 5 seconds. We give a brief 5 second window of opportunity for players to react to this incoming damage. Storm Surge will immediately end as soon as the threshold is reached. 

Storm Phase 0 - 100 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 1 - 100 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 2 - 70 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 3 - 70 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 4 - 50 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 5 - 50 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 6 - 30 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 7 - 30 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 8 - 30 Players Allowed
Storm Phase 9 - 30 Players Allowed

As an example, if there were 72 players remaining in Storm Phase 3 (where 70 players is the cap), Surge would continually deal damage to all players under the damage threshold until there were only 70 players left. Once only 70 players remain, it would end immediately until Storm Phase 4. 

**Q: /u/jamalzlitni10: A topic that has emerged in the community is building pre-edits. Many of us believe that pre editing should be an option to toggle on or off. Do you guys have any intent on making a change with pre-edits in the future?**

A: Yes, this is a topic we’re actively considering, and will update you on when future plans are firm. 

**Q: /u/kr0n_cs: From an observing point of view, how many people do you generally have observing and how does it work? Do they sit in front of 100 screens and monitor where the action will be, or is it just looking at the map and going to players who are nearby? Do you use any sort of way to automatically detect where the action will be, so that when players are about to fight, you will know where that will be?**

A: Great question! A lot depends on the show or event. We've had anywhere from 2 to 30 live observers in a match. We also now have two options for covering matches; live spectating and streaming server replays. There can be some differences in how we cover a match depending on which option we're using. 

For online events, such as our weekly World Cup qualifier show, we use streaming server replays. We'll typically have a crew of 13 observers which is composed of 2 teams of 5 as well as a game producer, game director, and observer director. In this case we have one team covering the match that is currently live, and the other team is watching and preparing for the next match on deck. Then we just swap between teams. Since we're using server replays and not presenting the matches ""live"" the teams will generally know, or have a pretty good idea of what happens in the match. Each team has a temporal scout that quickly finds relevant moments in the match for the team to cover. During the show the observer teams take direction from the game director and observer director to frame up shots and bring up the appropriate gameplay feeds. As the match plays out, the game director selects which views to cut to. The game producer's job is to guide the flow of the covers and is following both the map and any information about the match that the scouts were able to extract.

Covering matches live is a bit trickier. For our live events we use live spectating and have a slightly larger team of 17 observers. We'll typically have 4 teams of 3, 2 flex observers, a game producer, game director, and observer director. Since we are broadcasting a live match and anything can happen we use more teams to make sure we (almost) always have something both relevant and interesting we can jump to. As you can imagine making sure you are always covering the best action (Live!) can be difficult when players are spread all across the island! We also capture each team with a video replay system in case they capture something while another team was live on air. We've added mid-match replays to cover some of this stuff and fill lulls in the match. During a live match the game producer is watching the map, player stats, and listening to the observer teams, and taking into account previous matches in order to steer the coverage and find relevant action to jump to. 

Here is a shot from the observer pit at Secret Skirmish: https://imgur.com/i7nBuoQ

For fun here is what 100 player feeds looks like: https://imgur.com/vVURxy8

In terms of automating coverage we are actively developing a tool that can watch a live match (or replay) and determine the best moments based on a certain set of criteria. Some of these things include; Players closing distance on each other, elim streaks, long distance elims, no scopes, etc. We could use this tool to suggest when/where to cut to in a live show or allow people to automatically generate highlight reels from their own matches. A lot of what makes good coverage can be subjective so finding a good balance of what the criteria is and how a tool selects a moment in the match is what we're looking into right now. We can't wait to share this tool with everyone as soon as it is ready. 

Something interesting to note, we use the same tools to make our weekly show that are available for everyone in the live version of the game currently.  

**Q: /u/KurtMage: Has a competitive 2v2 mode (or even 1v1 or larger) ever been considered? The building mechanic in this game is incredible and feels like it should not be confined exclusively to the battle royale genre (for competitive). I'm not asking for something specific, it could be made with a CS-like buy system, COD-like load out system, Halo-like weapons on map system, TF-like class system, or whatever. I (and many) just love the mechanic and would love to see it on a non battle royale setting.**

A: We are definitely considering all kinds of possibilities when it comes to alternate competitive modes outside of Battle Royale. We have plans to continue to expand Creative Mode so players can create their own favorite version(s) of Fortnite. We’ll be closely monitoring these community-created competitive modes as the tools for Creative Mode expand, and will officially support some of the more popular ones that pop up over time.

**Q: /u/Kessarean: Will FOV see a reconsideration?**

A: We have no plans to implement an FOV slider. One of our major goals for competitive Fortnite is to support players in their journey to be able to become stars and build their own audiences around awesome performances and personas. Part of that goal means listening to the desires of their viewers, and stepping in when necessary. In this case, players were indicating they felt required to play with stretched resolution (or increased FOV) in order to remain competitive, and fans said that it was a negative experience to watch. 

We also don’t have any plans to adjust the current default FOV.  As stated in our previous communication on the topic: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/fortnite-competitive-development-update, it’s ultimately a tradeoff of a series of goals and we’re happy with where it’s at currently.


**Q: /u/beaushinkle: With the number of items / changes geared toward punishing boxes (stinks, explosive damage through walls, etc) it seems like the team isn't happy with how strong the box is in competitive play. Do you guys have plans to enable aggressive players who want to force fights with defensive players?**

A: We’re always looking at the balance of core gameplay. That includes items, weapons, building, loot availability, and more. Defensive building is strong, and there should always be some counters, but not excessively so. In general having a few items that force alternative strategies or requiring players to react is healthy for keeping the moment to moment fresh.

**Q: /u/DatGuyRich: We've seen over the last few world cup weeks that numerous streamers are pulling the same amount of numbers as the official Fortnite stream mainly because people prefer this method of spectating. So during the world cup will there be an option to spectate from one player's POV?**

A: We’re totally fine with streamers pulling in bigger numbers than our channel, and this possibility was something we had actually looked forward to in creating our approach. In general it's a goal of ours to help drive traffic to our players' streams. We completely understand that people may want to only watch their favorite streamer vs our show. Our coverage is generally meant to serve viewers who may not have a favorite streamer or who are looking for more information about a tournament as a whole. 

As an example of how we want to continue the spirit of supporting players and streamers first, for World Cup we will also be streaming the finalists’ replays LIVE, so if you wanted to you could load up the replay while the match is happening and watch from your favorite player's perspective.

**Q: /u/Pmoney98: The shotgun pullout delay was initially added to prevent the ‘double shotgun’ meta. In the current state of the game, double shotgun is both obsolete and irrelevant. The pullout delay feels obtrusive and clunky. Are there any plans to change this?**

A: We’re looking into possible tuning iterations here - the main thing we want to keep in mind is that the Pump Shotgun is still available in Creative (and always has the potential to be unvaulted), so we want to make sure that any adjustments take its unique characteristics into consideration.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Shotguns- In the current state of Fortnite I find more Snipers and Boom-Bows than I do shotguns. The shotgun spawn rate is terrible at the moment. Please fix this!!

2. Shields- There has been videos floating around reddit of people searching entire POI’s and getting no shields. A few suggestions I’ve heard are to make mini shields as common as bandages, or making boxes (like ammo boxes) that have high spawn rates and drop consumables. 

3. Boom-Bow- Please please please remove this gun. In my opinion the Boom-Bow is the most overpowered weapon that’s been in the game. It’s extremely accurate, uses shotgun ammo, and deals 100 damage!!!! I could say so much more about this weapon but I don’t have the time. 

4. Ballers- The baller is the most heavily abused vehicle in Fortnite. It almost guarantees placement points. I’m guessing you’ve all seen Ghost Bizzle make it into the Finals using no weapons, only consumables and ballers. Please don’t try to “balance” the baller, either just remove it all together, or just remove it from all competitive modes.

5. Snipers- Why is there 4 snipers?!? It has come to the point where you find way more snipers than shotguns.  It is extremely annoying when you search an entire house and only find a semi-sniper and a hunting rifle. I believe the only two snipers we should have is the Bolt Action and the Hunting Rifle. The semi-sniper is like the revolver... nobody likes it. And the heavy sniper is completely overpowered. Especially with the extremely low spawn rate of shields. 

6. FOV- Please just give us an FOV slider. Just please.

Queuing up with a duo, almost all of my games had consistent, fun fights.  
It wasn't just the pump - the entire loot pool felt great. Just the necessities, and tbh I barely noticed the guns I do carry often normally that weren't included. The lack of vehicles meant we weren't 3rd (or 4th/5th) partied the majority of the time. It still happened - but I'd say more like 33% of the time, which was enough to keep things unpredictable and keep people on their toes while still letting the majority of fights come to a satisfying conclusion via building and hitting shots. I ended up playing 6 hours or so on Monday, which is the most I've played in one day in several weeks or months.  After playing regular arena &amp; some pubs again yesterday, it really hit me how much fun I had playing Classic. 
I know these things are often addressed singularly here, but I wanted to comment on just how well things come together in this game when you play a few games with several of these factors adjusted. I hope they consider making this mode semi-permanent while they continue to experiment with the main game itself, or at least rotate it more often (along with Wick/headhunter).",FortniteCompetitive

And another example this same week with lanjok and his duo who I’m forgetting the name of. They AVERAGED 4th while ceice and elevate a game above them averaged 16th. On LAN this tourney is won by lanjok but instead they get 2nd not even being able to play out their 2 last games.

It’s a very cheap way of balancing the game and shows the lack of skill in the balance team that they can’t be bothered or can’t in general balance guns to make them better or worse and just remove them. The main 2 examples I can think of are the supressed smg and clingers. Both have been removed and brought back multiple times without any changes to their numbers really and they just expected them to do better in that certain meta. There was so much that could’ve been change about the smg that would have made it not feel so strong in comparison to the other smgs, even though the gun was at a good spot in comparison to the drum gun and people would pick either. Main way they could have nerfed it if they felt like they needed too was to increase the reload time. The reload time is faster than it takes for someone to use a mini so when someone is getting their walls spammed by it, it feels impossible to some players to counter it as you don’t get time to mini. Anyways in conclusion I have come from a league of legends background which had patches every 2 weeks and they would buff and nerf 10-15 champions to change the meta, without adding new items every week. It would keep the game feeling fresh as new champions would become good/bad and matchups would change. Removing items doesn’t make the game feel fresh. It makes it feel like the balance team doesn’t know what it’s doing unfortunately. This game still has the potential but the developers need to understand how to make and change metas without just removing and adding guns to the game",FortniteCompetitive

It was a post about the LMG. The comment that led me to make this decision was “whats wrong with losing every now and then?(talking about being spammed by 100 bullets)  The minority should control the majority.” And I responded to that person with the statement below:

“If the minority is more competent and understands what keeps a game healthy, then their thoughts on new weapons/items should have more of an impact. And that’s simply a fact. 

There are millions of idiots in America (where I live), but I don’t think they should choose what’s good or bad for the country. The president has a cabinet of extremely smart people who help advise him on decisions. It should be that way. Not listening to the idiots who want speed limits to be 100MPH. If that analogy makes sense”

With that being said, I wanted to further explain why the opinions of Professional Gamers should have more of an impact. These people play video games for a living. They have seen and lived through games that have been super popular and have died off. I believe if EPIC were smart (emphasis on the IF) they would have a pro player meeting once every couple months to get their opinion on every aspect of the game. 

This is simply my opinion and would love to hear yalls feedback on this.

I don’t miss the pump but honestly I would love it if epic brought it back with a big damage nerf. 65/70/75/80 body shot damage per rarity would be great, also nerf the tac with it.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Standardized looting, 100% chest/floor spawns, no double stacks of ammo and 100% chance to get some heals/shields out of chests.
2. Fov slider
3. Vault Ballers, make quads/driftboards 100% spawns
4. ""Fix"" low vs high ping, ie box fighting is unfair with low ping. (idk how they achieve this)
5. Remove shotgun swap delay
6. Massive qol updates for customs, player list, customizations, kicks/bans, an actual UI
7. Better competitive fortmat, something closer to ESL Katowice format
8. Improve arena, add more layers/divisions, add a leaderboard and a reason to grind/Seasons
9. Fix audio, /Shrug
10. Make seeing through the storm viable on non colorblind mode.

Do NOT address casual experience during the AMA, it does not benefit us in any way and it could take a spot for another question that would benefit us better.

&amp;#x200B;

There's 3 main things we need to address before everything else:

* **The shotgun delay.** Now that the pump is no longer here, having a shotgun delay is purely useless and only makes fights trash, we need to address it.
* **The loot/item pool in the competitive modes.** We need to address the loot pool we're given in the competitive modes, because it is everything but competitive right now, we have a sniper that does 157 damage (2 minis, knowing how rare shields are atm), we have a bow that does not require any sort of skill to use, we have ballers, etc.. We mainly need to address this and have them hopefully do a change after the World Cup (or even now if given the chance).
* **The loot spawn.** The current loot spawn is scuffed, every chest I open either has a hunting rifle or a semi-auto sniper, floor loot is all about the new Burst-SMG and flint knocks now.  
Literally 20 minutes ago, I looted the ENTIRITY of Lazy Lagoon, including the beach part and I found 1, ONE, shotgun, in that entire POI and it was a grey tac. RNG is a thing, yes, it's a battle royale, it's normal, but it should not be to this extent. I should not have to fly across the whole map to find a combat shotgun if I loot an ENTIRE POI by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to address what's important and what affects the competitive mode, I will not call this game competitive until the changes we need are done. Arena is already a W key fest because 10 IQ players already mindlessly push without knowing what they're doing no matter what their loot is, and the loot pool we currently have allows even more W keying.",FortniteCompetitive

I personally think the pump is harder to use bc of the damage drop off and punishes whiffing your shots more than the combat. The combat is used more like end of s4 double pump having long range, quick burst damage, and having the capacity of 10 rounds. The only difference is the reticle is smaller, but whiffing your shots is more forgiving bc of the quick fire rate and 10 round capacity.

On the other hand, the combat has a very small reticle making hitting shot somewhat difficult. Also because of the inability to one pump, it forces players to keep at range and be careful of engaging fights. The pump had a larger reticle and the ability to W key in someone’s box could give a quick painless kill

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by saying, I am not good at all!  I was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction.  I am not very good at understanding what I am doing or why everything I do in the game is basically just muscle memory from grinding inside of creative or playing as many games as I can get in a session.   Although I do like to imagine I have some type of IQ within the game it doesn't seem to work out for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I say ""point"" I don't mean like YouTube videos because even tho they do some pretty impressive things they usually don't explain the reasoning behind their every action.  I was wondering if there was any complied lists for; Movement (situational awareness, height/low ground, when to peek, how to peek) rotation, how to make good choices, fight or flight, aim exercises, building/editing (when and why), load out understanding (with bloom as a factor as well when switching between weapons (basically a 5 piece load out for specific weapons, utilities, and healing...

* Combat
* Shadow Bombs/Gliders/Flint
* HP (Medkid/Slurp/Bandies)
* SP (Mini/Half)

&amp;#x200B;

That is what I mean.  The reason behind this is because there is one thing I have found,  when I switch from my AR to Combat shotgun, the reticle (?) stays collapsed and deals solid damage when ADS.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 300 points in arena, I have been fluctuating lately, and I am not staying consistent.  It leads me to believe that I was just ""getting"" by with grinding.  I am trying to find the point of balancing the grind, and knowledge.  How do I do this? How do I understand what I am doing and why?  How do I build the fabled GAME IQ). **NOTE:** Any comments that I can use and become better from, or use as inspiration to think differently about this game will help, and Ill just copy and paste everything into this post for future usage. &lt;\_&gt;;

I remember reading something Kayuun said: 

&gt; Some will have it easier than others, that's life. As long as you don't just ""grind"" the game and actually put some thought into your gameplay, you'll improve. 

 I do put thought into my game play, it just doesn't stick and I am low-key dumb when it comes to Fortnite.

Changes:

-Make the arrow speed slower and take longer to fully charge (this will make it more skillful to hit a player instead of the current near-hitscan).

-Make the explosive have a 2 second delay before exploding instead of instantly on impact 

-Raise the damage for “sticking” somebody to 25 (sticking someone in the body will do 125 which I think is fair as it will be hard to do if they’re moving and won’t kill a 150 hp player)

-Raise the damage for “sticking” somebody in the head to 100. IMO hitting a headshot should be a one shot kill given the new physics will make it difficult (also if someone reacts fast enough, they can get a mini off before it explodes and survive)",FortniteCompetitive

Not just the obvious things like the reboot van and the floating ship things, but the loot pool as well. They removed the pump which was very common and replaced it with the combat shotgun. The combat to me resembles the peacekeeper in Apex. Then they reduced the spawn rate. This too reminds me of Apex. The peacekeeper is relatively hard to find in Apex and you can go many games without finding one. On the flip side of that, you have the tac shotgun which is basically the auto shotgun and can be found pretty often. The pistols in fortnite seem to be waaaaay more common now than they were before and are basically the first weapon you find every game now, which again, was the same as in Apex. The tactical assault rifle is basically the R-301. The new burst SMG is basically the prowler. The meta in Apex is very assault rifle and sniper rifle heavy with Smgs dominating up close due to the rarity of shotguns. Sound familiar? Now Apex has body armor in different rarities. Fortnite has drinkable shield potions, but there are some similarities in the rates at which you find good shield in Apex and any shield in fortnite. Think of minis as blue armor and big pots as purple armor. Chugs a d slurps would be more like purple/gold armor.

I have played hundreds of games in my life. I have never hated any game company. That has changed. I hate epic games. I hope anyone responsible for 90% of the decisions made in fortnite in the last few months hits their head somewhere and gets some sense knocked into them. Stop making your game an rng fest. The game isnt a game now, its just a roll of the dice to see who gets the best loot. Stop reducing the skill gap. Bring back stretched. Bring back the pump with 95 max damage. Bring back the normal smg with a 1.75x headshot multiplier. Vault the boombow. Vault the tac. Vault this ridiculous new smg (a burst machine gun .... an oxymoron if I ever saw one). Vault the silenced sniper. Vault the heavy sniper. Vault the scoped AR. Vault the common pistol or make it more viable by halving bloom. Bring back the original bolt action. Reduce the drum gun clip size to 35/40 so its a slower firing P90 that uses medium ammo. And for gods sake make shield much more common. Make shield/health drop from every single chest. Bring back a nerfed siphon. 50 health per kill in 50 seconds. Bring back mats per kill. Stop being blind to the fact that people are getting better at the game. The average fight takes a hundred times mroe mats than it did in the early days. Players NEED more mats because everyone has gotten better. The last party to the fight always wins because of this. Little timmys will play even when they die off spawn 3/5 times. Don't make your core playerbase leave. Don't destroy your game.

Just had an arena game where a guy who had 5 kills landed near me, proceeded to kill 2 people, then I hit him for like 30 damage with my combat shotty when he was exposed. Then he drinks a shield and proceeds to reload his sniper and I'm sitting in a solid metal 1x1 with my baller waiting to rotate zone and he literally just one shots my full metal wall and shoves right in because he knows what an advantage it is. I manage to somehow squeak out in my baller, which he proceeds to shoot out. Then he ramps over me and I know he's just going to do it again, so I'm forced to use my rift to escape.

  
I watched replay and this is how this guy got every one of his kills minus one where he just heavy sniped someone out in the open. He just used this strat every time to just take people's walls no problem, and I think it's just kind of dumb. I made sure to focus him from distance the rest of the match and probably did about 300 damage total to him, before he glided to a spot and got focused from 3 people and a rocket launcher and died.

The changes that Epic have made to the game have lacked logic, and have made the game turn into a chore, not a fun experience. I will show in this post different things that make Fortnite a worse game, and are not even good for casual players. 

Epic: **Over time, players began to disengage in the core modes, stating that the game had gotten too intense to be enjoyable.**

Then why reduce the amount of shields found on Arena as well? Finding shields in the World Cup was almost impossible in some games. What is Epic's goal for competitive Fortnite? Shouldn't we be playing on an even field? 

**Ballers*

It is ridiculous that after more than a month we are still dealing with ballers. They require no skills whatsoever, can destroy builds, and protect the driver from harm. Here's some questions:

Why is there a delay for shotguns that don't one pump, but there's not a delay for shooting after a player exits a baller? Isn't that too aggressive for your standards Epic? 

**Shields**

What do you want this game to be Epic? Why is there no shields in most places? This is the most insane thing that you have done to your game so far. After a fight we need to heal. Who benefits from this? If a bad player is hurt, how are his chances of winning any better? Aren't casuals suffering from this as well? 

**Drum Gun**

Remove this weapon. It's stupidly OP, and there's no counter. If you are going to keep it, bring back the Pump Shotgun. What's your obsession with making things that have no viable counter? First it was Airplanes, then it was the Ballers, now the Drum? You removed it from the game for a reason. Either heavily nerf it and make it gold, or remove this from competitive playlists. 

**Competitive Loot Pool** 

I understand that Competitive Fortnite is nothing but an Ad for your game. We all get it. But there's people who solely depend on this game, it's their careers. And with the money you are pumping into it, you should be more responsible about the way you handle the competitive community. 

This is what I think we should have in Arena/tournaments: 

The most common guns should be Blue weapons. Then Green and Purple should have the same spawn rate. And Grey and Gold weapons should be rare. Why do you want to create an even field in CASUAL modes but not in your competitive modes? 

Also, we have been asking for months about the removal of OP weapons, such as the Bow and the RL. They require no skill and are being abused. 

**Bugs**

There are professional players who play on PC with a controller, such as Nickmercs, Nio, and Ayden. I don't understand why there's still a bug that won't allow players playing on console to Turbo Build in the middle of a game. This is crazy, and it made me throw two games and more than 40 minutes into the trash during WC games.

He might be a good player but his consistency can just be explained by the wall replace trick probably macro. In between good players without this trick there would be nothing to force somebody death. To die in a 1vs1 with enough mats one always has to make a mistake. Vs this exploit no.

Don't get me wrong, the slipstreams absolutely should be shut off during the late moving circles, since the size of the circle makes it very difficult to avoid them. But before the 5th circle even starts closing in? There is plenty of space to work around the slipstreams if you don't want to use them, and for those who got bad RNG on the 5th circle, they can still be incredibly useful.

2. Performance: ima keep this really short 
Season 7: 160 plus fps
Season 9: 100 or less fps

Like this game really needs an optifine mod for it.

3. Community: if you tell somebody you play the game, you get shamed on, because the whole fucking community is 7 year olds named Timmy WHO VOTED FOR THE FUCKING DRUM GUM, AND RUINED THE GAME. For real the community ruined the game, just like how they ruined minecraft, except now the kids who played minecraft now play Fortnite.

4. Epic games in general: Epic games is a money hungry horrible company, they are trying to create exclusives, which hurts the video game industry as a whole, and the Epic Store sucks the fattest cocks of the century, their is so many problems with it.

5. The game in general:
The meta sucks, also epic games is really trying to make the game have more RNG, and appealing to casuals, and competitive events are just ways for epic to show off the new features, and dont take it seriously.

I just need help because I placed 144 week 3 solo finals and I placed 71 week 7 finals, week one I placed 17th in the semi finals (not as well the finals just top 1400 or something) and then the 5th week of solos I had to go to something family emergency related out of state for the weekend.

One thing I do is try to explain the reason for everything I do and maybe it messes me up, or I look for the reason we both died or the reason that I messed up etc. it’s not excuses I’m like actually giving reasons like “I should have boxed up before going for this guy since I got sniped” and I dont know if it messes with me or not but I’m just throwing that out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet just like three weeks later, there's a reason we aren't seeing much ""Bring Back The Pump"" stuff anymore. And I think that's because we realize (but dont necessarily want to admit) that vaulting the pump and adding the combat actually made the game more balanced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epic saw a flaw in their game: with building, almost every fight becomes a close range fight and there should not be ONE gun that is pretty much a requirement to have in those fights. therefore, by introducing the combat shotgun, a much more balanced game is created in which the gun is still definitely effective in close range fights, but does essentially not decide the outcome of the fight based on who has the gun and if both people do, who happens to hit their first shot first

&amp;#x200B;

I think the new shotgun update has allowed for more of an entertaining competitive scene and we deserve to give Epic some acknowledgement when its deserved.

An example of this is when they removed syphon, stating that many players were choosing to play LTM’s instead of the current game mode.

With this in mind, I would love to see how popular the classic game mode is in comparison to other ltm’s, and how many people are choosing to play classic over squads. I’m willing to bet that a large amount of people are playing classic, probably more than other LTM’s. Comp players like it for the greater simplicity and the existence of the pump. Casual players love it for the nostalgia they get by feeling like they’re playing season 3 again. 

My point is, if its true that tons of players are loving classic mode, which I believe is the case, epic should consider the implications that this has on the state of the regular mode. The lack of pump, saturated spam weapon loot pool, excessive mobility, are all causing many people to enjoy classic mode more than regular squads currently, I know I’ve been having fun using the pump-tac smg. 

Hopefully epic reviews feedback and play% on the classic mode and makes some considerations about the style of game that people want to play. Classic mode feels like what fortnite should be, in my opinion, and the fact that both casuals and competitive players enjoy it could make its implications more impactful for epic.

There only is a slight problem with it. Is most people's pinky's aren't strong enough to consistently tap at high speeds.

If you set your wrist down and test out each finger on fast tapping you will realize that using your pinky is a lot slower than other fingers.

Most would say their index finger is the fastest at tapping.

So I decided to try out using my edit key to F and using my pick up as L-Shift.

I found in my experience that editing with my index finger is almost twice as fast and 100% easier to connect double edits without mistakes.

My fingers also don't get tired now because I'm not consistently spamming my pinky.

And I'm talking weapons exclusively, not consumables and utility items

For me personally, I would enjoy the game more if the loot pool was simplified drastically. In my perfect world, the loot pool would be reduced to essentials, with a few extra weapons in various categories. 

Here's my ideal loot pool for weapons:

AR, AK, Silenced Scar, Combat, Pump, Bolt, HR, Silenced SMG, Deagle, Grenades

(AR includes purple &amp; gold scar)

Maybe this post comes from the frustration of getting fucked by a bow, or getting heavy sniped for 150, but this is a thought that I've had for a while

A simplified loot pool would also reduce RNG, which I'm all for. Players would be on a relatively even playing field and there would be no ""power weapons"".

I just don't understand the need to have so many variations of weapon types. We don't need the semi auto sniper or the heavy sniper, nor do we need the drum gun or the minigun

If Epic remodeled the loot pool in Arena and adjusted it correctly, I can say with almost full certainty that I would only play Arena. There's no need for pubs and arena to have the exact same loot pool, especially when it's been shown that pubs are catered towards the lesser skilled players and casuals

In my opinion, simple is better. In my perfect Fortnite, the drum gun, minigun, heavy sniper, boombow, tactical ar all don't exist. Soley my personal opinion and the vision for how I would have the mosy fun playing Fortnite",FortniteCompetitive

It’s so demoralising early game when your RNG takes a shit over you and you’re left having to fight someone that spoke to the RNG gods pre-match and got a Combat Shotgun, minis/half pot and a blue Drum Gun. 

Furthermore, I think Health Boxes could be a really positive addition to the game. Akin to Ammo Boxes, you’d search them and they’d give you 1 or 2 health items; Minis, Slurps, Med Kits, Half Pots, etc.

Apex Legends has an abundance of shield spawns and it doesn’t break the game whatsoever.

His playstyle usually consists of lots of building and editing, which often are fancy and nice to watch. This is something that characterizes Nick, and he has been playing like that since I started watched him (1 year now). What I will be saying now is not only going to be directed at Nick, but also a lot of other people. It may also help and remind you. Nick, however, is the prime example and I couldn't continue my day without stating this.

1. Editing: Nick's editing is probably what he is most known for. His edits are fast and clean, making them satisfying to watch in general. However, there is a place and a time for editing. I have been watching all of competitive Nick, as well as his World Cup Qualifier matches, and it's nothing less than obvious that Nick edits a bit too much. This not only hinders him from actually shooting and damaging his opponents, but also distracts him from them. (If you want examples, just go watch his latest World Cup Solo try, but I am going to provide some examples). The few times it works, in competitive, it obviously looks good, but notice the word ""few"".  Lots of times Nick dies, it's because he is disoriented and/or stuck on his edits. On those times he is so far from being a threat to his opponents, and it looks like he is (more or less) fighting himself. It seems like his editing playstyle, and simply overcomplicating it, is something that's mentally ingrained in him; something that he is so used to, that he can't change. Examples (reminder: this is some recent examples that I quickly found from yesterdays qualifiers)

Game 9: (skip to: 3:47:50)

Game 3: (skip to: 2:14:24)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Building: Nick's building is pretty similar to his edits: fancy and consisting of lots of different techniques. But similar   
 to his edits, I often ask the necessity of a lot of his building. Not only by using an unnecessary amount of materials, but also doing a lot of weird building choices. What's interesting is that Nick always points it out after he dies: ""Oh, why did I do that"", ""Not worth it"", but time after time, and close to all engagements, rotations and builds he makes are consisting of weird and unnecessary decisions. Him trying to do some fancy build often hinders him (same as his editing) from actually focusing on, locating and damaging his opponent. While usually resulting in hin being his own biggest enemy, which is both sad and frustrating for both him and the viewers (I see a lot of other comments in his chat pointing same things out). One example of this is in game 2: skip to 1:57:20. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of other examples, not only from yesterday, but from a lot of other tournaments. This is sad, because I can see the potential in him. Nick overcomplicating stuff is, however, and unfortunately, close to being a fact now, and I really want him too read this and maybe take some constructive criticism. A huge contrast to Nick is Ninja, which never overcomplicates his builds and edits, but usually just does what's necessary and needed. Ninja obviously has some mechanical problems, where he, for example, messes up a lot of edits, but that's another story. Ninja, in contrast to Nick, always tries to find opportunities to damage his opponent, while Nick often ""fights himself"". Nick has a really good aim and flicks, but unfortunately, he rarely gets to show it in competitive games. I am aware that is a solid and ingrained part of his mentality and style of playing, but I hope both Nick and you reading this will maybe understand and learn something from this, from this 'curse' of overcomplicating.",FortniteCompetitive

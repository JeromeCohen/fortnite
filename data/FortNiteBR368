Making a kill right off the bat after landing and dying soon afterwards gives you roughly the same points as not making a kill and then dying very soon into the game. 

Examples: 

Landing, killing right away, then being killed (tilted towers type scenario): 134 points.

Landing, NO kill, then being killed right away: 102 points in one example and 136 points in another.

Furthermore, staying in the game a while but making no kills gives you a whopping amount of points. Example: roughly 500 points for no kills but staying in until top 14.

So, the XP points system is heavily biased towards merely staying in the game. As someone who is an average player at best, this system rewards me and punishes the really good players.

This system rewards hiding like a little bitch; lying in wait, etc. (all things that I have done or still do depending on the match LOL). This system rewards taking no affirmative action other than merely surviving.

I feel like surviving should accrue *some* points but kills should give a lot more points. What do you think, Fortnite fam?",FortNiteBR

The spacial sound is in my opinion should be EPIC's priority number one.

To put it into perspective, I have a couple of studio headphones and three pairs of gaming headsets, my favorite pair is the Sennheiser GAME ZERO, in CSGO I can literally close my eyes and still know where everybody is, regardless of if it's up/down/left/right, same for Overwatch (although there is very little sneaking/hiding, some characters like Reaper often flank and it's crucial to hear enemy positioning).

Tested Fortnite with all of them, as well as Rokit6 studio monitors (for the lolz), none of them made a difference.

Here's a great example, and a question you all should ask yourselves:

When your friend talks to you, does looking at him makes him sound any louder? nope, because that's not how sound works, so why does looking at the direction of a chest make it louder?

Bad sound design that's why.

You should be able to hear where the chest is in relation to your position, not to where you're *looking at*.

Take it as constructive criticism EPIC, not just a rant.

I've seen many posts about this over the last few months, yet no reply about even acknowledging the problem (maybe I missed it), please give us some shred of hope, before ranked mode starts

For the last two skins in the current season, it is the secret agent type and John Wick. Both are really cool, but they could have been a USSR Cosmonaut and an Alien, or Uhura and Captain Kirk from Star Trek.

These are just two ideas off the top of my head, but there are plenty more. 

I do like the John Wick skin but they could leave it for a new season that is themed like action movie hero and villains. 


-------------------------------------------------------

Edit: for a Hollywood Heros &amp; Heroines season pass, the cosmetics would have to not be copyrighted stuff obviously. But there are tons of ideas that could be used, for example: 

- somebody wearing dirty clothing that all looks like camping stuff (food, water, hatchet) on his back bling and a big beard could be called ""Survivalist from Spooky Scares: Part II"" 

- somebody wearing super bright tights with big goggles over their eyes, and a back bling that is a cape or something called ""The Tilted Tower Titan""

- somebody with a pretty generic 70s detective outfit; purple leather jacket, mustard button down shirt, bell bottoms, big gold chain, aviators. Call him ""Detective Daddio""

- somebody in a lab coat with crazy hair and a huge scar across his face. His back bling could be a crazy looking machine with buttons and levers all over it. Call him ""The Despicable Dr. Gizmo""

When I saw this I instantly love it, but it is no longer available. I wanted to see if you could bring it back to the shop. I also noticed that many people want it back. I suggest that you could make a throwback week when every day you put in the shop an old skin that the community wants. I hope that you consider this and hopefully you can make this a reality.

I also got an e-mail a couple of times (last was in 2nd of April) saying ""Account Locked"" because of multiple invalid login attempts which is stupid since my client is set to auto-login whenever i open it so i don't have to insert my password. 

Is it because people are trying to steal accounts, or why? And how can i log in?

Simply put if you have 6-7 traps in one building it's too op if there's still 70-80 ppl left just at the beggining. 

75 damage would be fine for the amount of traps around the area, more players walking around on low hp is good..

Now if you disagree be polite or at least have more wins than me because I'm sitting nice and pretty at 335 right now not including the squad or duo.

Seriously I have no problem for 125 damage if there was less of them no reason 4 traps should be placed at the start of a round unless they did less damage.

Look I get it. Our items on Fortnite are just digital toys. 
I dropped a few guns, epic and legendary , so he 'could see' what I had to trade. 
Granted I was not a fan of these and that is why I only dropped them. But it was 6 to 9 weapons and I feel some child (I think he is about 9 to 12) stealing and laughing when he booted me form his homeworld is a serious ethic concern. 

Want to know why we have school shootings? Well these little signs are ignored by parents and teachers... sure it seems like not a 'big deal' but it is a twisted personallity that continues to hurt others simply for a sadistic joy.

My main concern is if this kid does this to other kids. Man that would so wrong. 
I am a serious crafter on all games, so having tons of weapons and stuff is a promblem, I actually drop a few weapons every round.... but many of the younger players just go around shooting and weapons are very scarce.

I have reported his activity to epic and playstation network.
This scam was done 4/8/18 at 1:38 am. I have records of the invites and screen shots. You can see it was not just dennishampton38 taking an active roll. His co criminals also sent invites at the same time.

dennishampton38 has a youtube channel. only 8 subs

I am a parent and I would love to be able to send his parents info about their son's activity. Still digging on the internet but I'm hoping to notify his parents ASAP.

For his sake I hope his real name isn't Dennis Hampton.. who's partent would let their kids use their full name as a user id? LOL

If the revolver is classified as a pistol (which it is) and since it now uses medium ammo instead of light ammo, doesn’t that mean it has no place in fortnite? 

It shoots slower than its pistol counterparts which makes it worse at close range for all but those who can consistently land headshots and worse at medium range because it now has more damage drop off than all other guns that use medium ammo, which are almost necessities, ars. 

I believe EPIC needs to change how shooting works entirely personally, but they need to at least change how revolvers function. This all, of course, only matters if revolvers do work like other pistols.",FortNiteBR

I have an idea for a new mode that I think would be pretty fun. Hide and seek.

The game would center on a single named location/area (Tilted Towers or somewhere like Shifty+the two houses) and would basically work in an infection play style.

Basically, players spawn in and the circle is already small to the point where it’s only centered around the Hide and Seek area.  One player would be designated as “It” and jump out of the bus with (or glide to a platform with) a gray pump with 10-20 rounds of ammo.  This is for ending the remaining players after “It” finds them.

The rest of the players (99 for bigger areas, less for smaller) would spawn on the ground.  They have the time it takes for the player in the bus, “It”, to land to get into a hiding spot.  These players would spawn with 2 or 3 Boogie Bombs in their inventory.  They can use these Boogie Bombs on “It” in an attempt to get away after they are spotted.  

If “It” manages to down a player, that player respawns as a member of the seeking team.  The last person left hiding gets a Victory Royale.
(This is up for debate, maybe they have to avoid the up-to 99 seekers for x amount of time)

I think this would be a fun addition to Fortnite and expand its playability.  I know after grinding squads or solos I would love to be able to jump into a game that acts as comic relief for a few matches.

They can just use the melee weapon, have a very obvious zombie skin (easy enough to design) and then the zombies have a certain amount of minutes to turn everyone.

They start with 4 minutes for example, with every kill 10-30 seconds is added to the clock. 

The island would be smaller and there would be no cloud to make the area smaller.

Victory conditions remain essentially the same, it is still a battle royale with last man standing. However, *zombies do respawn* and the number of zombies will constantly be increasing while the number of living players will constantly be decreasing.

So as a living player you have to keep in mind your living enemies and the horde of zombies trying to ""recruit"" you, you might want to keep some living people alive in order to keep the horde at bay.

Hiding would help, building would help as always.

I'm not bitching about the homing missle because I'm not convinced it's broken. But to be able to fire 5 RPGs consecutively with no reload in between each shot is absolutely ridiculous and even master builders will be beat by this. It takes no skill, lowers the skill gap, and does nothing but remove competitive/tactical play from this game.

Please upvote and or comment to show your support to get this fixed ASAP. Thank you.",FortNiteBR

(Hardware: GTX 1070, i7700k, see more details in the DxDiag file, please see the real issue in the example FPS numbers.) When I start a game, I get maximum FPS I can get. When I start playing, it slowly decreases overtime. It is like the game is slowly capping itself down. (Lowest settings) This is how it goes:

Start-70 Alive: 400+ FPS https://s31.postimg.org/mjzbevdqj/400.jpg

20 Alive: 300ish FPS https://s31.postimg.org/pqtuyjg6z/300.jpg

Endgame (Top10) 200ish FPS (sometimes only 90-100)https://s31.postimg.org/uphdd2rpn/280.jpg

Some people can say, that these are high FPS numbers still, but people who have higher refresh rate screens will know the real issue here. The input lag that lower-100 FPS gives compared to higher numbers like 400 is also very noticeable. And we got these hardwares for a reason.



Fact 1 - most important!) When I make the character model disappear from the screen (pushing up to a wall, looking up while standing on stairs backwards, looking in a scope), my FPS resets back to the maximum 4-500 FOR THE TIME the character is not visible. https://s31.postimg.org/nnjfqwqor/480.jpg | After moving back my character on screen FPS jumps back to its original reduced state.
Fact 2) The issue (decreasing) is not this considerable on certain skins (Rust Lord won't drop until 100, it'll stay in the 250-300 zone.)
Fact 3) I don't have every skins to test but for example the Dark Voyager is completely unaffected by this.
Fact 4) After guiding a guided missile (character disappears for that time), when I jump back to the character, FPS is reset to its original non-reduced state, to 4-500 ish, then it starts reducing again overtime.
Fact 5) When my FPS is limited enough (200-250) when I stand still with the character I got that FPS, but when I start moving it drops down by 20-40 for the time I'm moving.
Fact 6) I found out that if I don't move with my character at all until endgame (yes, I have managed to do it), my FPS won't start dropping.

I have been dealing with this for a long time, got every scenario possible to reproduce this. First I though that there is a problem with my PC, because !-not everyone's having this-!, but after I found out a lot of people actually do, and considering the FPS limit completely goes away when the character model is not rendering on screen, this must be more likely a game-side issue (affecting certain hardwares I guess).

I was writing about peak FPS numbers here. (Looking up in the sky every in every case.) Back blings and pickaxes are not affected.

I found several Twitch streamers having this issue like: summit1g - Start: https://clips.twitch.tv/ShyFrailEggnogDendiFace
End: https://clips.twitch.tv/AdorableVibrantGrouseCeilingCat

You can see his FPS increasing to 160-170 when he stops moving (Fact 5), but overall he's got like 120 FPS at this time. By the time they finish this game he's got like 80-90 FPS. (You can check this, and track his FPS in the whole game if you watch the whole match in the VOD.)

I don't have clips but these guys have the same issue: Pikkaboooo, Tfue.

Note that Summit's got GTX1080Ti SLI, Tfue Single 1080Ti, Pikkaboooo and I got a 1080. These are not the FPS numbers that you want to have with these hardwares.


Now I reached the point that I can't play with any other skins than the Dark Voyager, even though I have bought many, which makes me even more sad. (Fun Fact: Default skins are also all bugged.)

Guess this is not reported cause 99% of the playerbase's not having even 100 FPS at all, and the other 1% is just OK with it, or they are not sensitive to FPS drops or input lag. (The FPS numbers tell it all.)


Let me know if you need any more information, I can answer all your questions, just help me get out of this hell.

Troubleshooting performed: (Some of them are really stupid, but I really wanted to fix this so I had to have hope in every small thing.) Tried all versions of Windows 10 freshly installed, about 4-5 drivers on the video card, Vbios flash, GPU overclock, Processor overclock, disabling threads, disabling multithreading, switching RAM sticks, overclocking RAM, disabling services mentioned in the basic troubleshooting, all possible options in Nvidia control panel, disabling firewall, disabling Nvidia shadowplay, tried windowed mode, windowed fullscreen, tried every possible ingame video options, tried tweaking config files, adding launch options to the game, installing older directx, lowering monitor refresh rate, disabling fullscreen optimizations, overriding high dpi scaling behaviour, win7 compatibility mode, administrator, etc... My hardwares are physically properly installed. Trust me, I tried EVERY possible thing that a man can try to resolve an issue. Date first encountered: Noticed about a month ago, but some people reporting that it persits from 2.5 so I guess its something wrong with these: (from 2.5 Patch notes) - Optimized performance of player animations to improve overall frame rate. - Eliminated various hitches caused by certain skins and items being loaded at unexpected times. - Character models, weapons and environment assets now utilize a Level of Detail system to improve performance.

- Jumping bug, if you jump to much; switch guns too fast or reload your gun you are not able to jump.

-Shotguns, I understand that shotguns are pellet based and some bullets wont hit the body but the fact a tactical shotgun or pump can do a headshot from 7-9 is pretty annoying during battles, I've lost many battles due to this problem.

-Floating guns, this bug can be game-breaking but I've only lost one battle due to it and this happens when you either switch to another gun or switch constantly and the gun you had equipped when switching would start floating in the air, I have a few screenshots of this on ps4 but I can't show it because I don't know how to transfer pictures to PC, this bug shows up alot in Fortnite moments.

-Launchpad, this one to me is kind of funny and I don't mind if you can't fix it but I was once in a 1v4 and I used a glider and jumped and it didn't let me deploy my glider but I laughed it off.

-This one is one of my annoying ones, sometimes when I try to build in the middle of a really intense build battle I always die of falling because it didnt let me place anything. (I'm not an amazing builder so most of the times was my fault...)

-Another one which has never happened to me would be falling through Player-building I've seen this twice in clips, Daequan's clip would be an example.

-Please don't add vehicles like they have in PUBG the game is good without them but if you try to add it make it balanced please.

-People complain about the fact guided missiles is the same rarity as rocket launchers but you can control it instead and it does the same damage so It's too ""OP"" but I really don't mind I love the guided missile and if people die from it they're clearly not wearing headphones or are not able to build.

-This one is a kind of unknown bug but when a player like me loves to use the tactical smg sometimes this bug is really annoying, on the tactical smg when you reach the last clip which I'm pretty sure is 12 bullets it doesn't let me shoot those 12 bullets in the middle of the fight and displays the ""Out of ammo"" animation.

-Sometimes you get hitmarkers with the shotguns but it does no damage.

Ok Fortnite I love your game please don't take this as a rant I'm only hoping that you fix these bugs if you can!",FortNiteBR

Its sad to see that ~~fortnite~~ Bugnight with developers, who think that weekly updates are a good thing, are the face of video games. This game is literally making me age twice as fast because I keep dying to bugs. 

Honestly I'm looking for downvotes cause I'm salty as hell about how more broken this game gets every patch, Epic Games seems to treat all of their communities with the upmost priority over money. (sarcasm).

Lets be real these small time companies having these massively popular games is not a good thing for video games. The next BR game is going to do the same thing that Fortnite did to PUBG. I hear both Valve, and blizzard are working on concepts for BR games for CSGO, and WoW respectably. 

Honestly, that is probably the best if one of these big time developing companies take over the BR franchise, we learn that these smaller companies get overwhelmed and just cannot seem to figure out how to pump out fixes, and listen to the communities of their games.

We all aren’t going to be spoiled 12 year old kids, who steal our mums credit cards. 20 dollars for a cosmetic item in a game is too, too much.

They instantly said, ""what's that?"" And I had to explain it to them and they told me they thought it was the full game. Keep in mind, I'd consider these guys being above average players with a ton of hours and not casuals who just hop on from time to time. 

This got me thinking.. I'm pretty confident that a majority of people playing don't know that what they're playing is a beta. Whenever I see articles or news coverage about Fortnite, it's never reported as a beta. Add the fact that there's purchasable cosmetics it's completely understandable how the average person wouldn't know it's a beta or what a beta is. 

To clarify, if you frequent this sub you would most likely have knowledge what a beta is. 

Just a couple questions: have there been micro transactions in other betas before? Also, how long does a beta like this typically last? I see a lot of people making excuses due to the fact that this is a beta, but do these problems just disappear when the game gets the final stamp of approval?

I decided to try this out and I played 5 games. Now before I did this little experiment I had only played about 190 games on solo, somewhere around there and only had 1 win on PS4 using my controller. I never really cared about wins and I was always a pc player but I wanted to play fortnite on my console since the graphics are better and my pc sucks at running games that require really good graphics. I hoped on fortnite attached my KB&amp;M and the first 2 games I lost I think mainly due to the keybinding and sensitivity so for my 3rd and 4th games I switched my bindings and sensitivity out. Played my 3rd and 4th game and landed near moisty and practiced building till the storm killed me. Luckily no one interrupted me. My 5th game I went in to play to win and it was down to me and this John Wick skin player. We had a building fight and he literally could not keep up building against me. It was literally me taking high ground every time and shot gunning him and him literally just building walls and not being able to take high ground. And he was actually good, just from seeing him build and play he was pretty good but he just couldn’t keep up with building. I ended up winning with I believe maybe 9 or 10 kills, mind you I haven’t won since my 105th game. It was literally no competition and now I definitely believe that KB&amp;M PS4 players are at a huge advantage when playing against PS4 controller players. It truly is unfair. Now I have only done 5 games and only one was a success. I will not continue to play using KB&amp;M as it is unfair and will use my controller from now on. I hope you believe me when I tell you this (although I know some of you won’t, but it’s ok). Epic should really create another server for players who use KB&amp;M on console.",FortNiteBR

I think this could help squad matchmaking a lot. I’m not gonna lie sometimes late at night I can’t use my mic because I’m loud and this would come in handy.

As such they either are terribly low \- or terribly high making the game hard to hear and then communicate with them.

Last night for example my son had a friend join us for 7 games, and he had his volume EXTREMELY HIGH. Even when I took my headset volume down to 1 this kid was so loud that I it hurt my ears AND I could not hear ANYTHING else in the game. 

Given the kid was otherwise friendly and a good teammate I regretfully had to mute him \-\- but I would highly have preferred to have some sort of ability to have a slider bar to adjust his volume in game to a reasonable level.

Ideally this would be nice to be able to supply a boost to people who have low volumes as well as damping those with loud volumes?  But at bare minimum the damping is critical because damaging my ears is not okay!

I shouldn’t be able to get a gold Scar for 500 wood (in Lonely Lodge nonetheless). And in what world am I ever going to cough up 200 metal for a Trap?

This is how I think vending machines should be readjusted:

Grey &amp; Green vending machines = wood.
Blue &amp; Purple = stone.
Gold = metal.

I shouldn’t really have to explain this, but the higher the rarity should match with a harder resource to harvest. 

In addition, I’m not sure how individual items would be priced out, but for example:

If you roll up on a gold vending machine and it contains a Silenced Handgun, a Scar, and a Chug Jug, they shouldn’t all cost 500 metal. Maybe something like this:

Silenced Handgun = 200 metal
Scar = 500 metal
Chug Jug = 200 or 300 metal??

Or maybe if you roll up on a purple vending machine:

Scoped AR = 250 stone
Launch Pad = 300 stone
Semi-auto Sniper = 350 stone

These are just rough estimates maybe you guys can come up with better numbers. 

But these two adjustments, in my opinion, would equal the value of the item you’re trying to redeem and infinitely make vending machines better. 

What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

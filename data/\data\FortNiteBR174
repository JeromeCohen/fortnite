I think back to October of last year to January and remember how much better this game was. It used to be just the right blind of serious and silly. 

Now the scales have tipped way over towards the silly extreme. The game became more and more catered to a younger, more casual audience. Most changes over the last 6 months have been bad for the game.

Why do shotguns have such a large spread in how much damage they can do while other guns have a fixed amount of damage they can do?


I believe this is why the ""spray meta"" has become such a prevalent issue, especially since the introduction of the P90. We've found that the P90 does a specific, guaranteed amount of damage for each shot, so why would anyone want to use a shotgun and risk getting killed due to RNG whenever we hit someone with it? Personally, I would rather take an SMG over any shotgun because I feel like I have a better chance of eliminating any given player with it due the constant damage output. While they're trying to shoot me with a shotgun once per second (give or take), I'm shooting several bullets from an automatic weapon and getting consistent hits, almost always resulting in a kill if the other guy gets low damage hits from his shotgun.


The solution is simple: have shotguns do a fixed amount of damage based on how far away the target is. 10 damage would make sense if the player is far away, while 150 damage would make sense if the player was say... 10 feet away or closer.

No other guns do damage based on RNG; why should shotguns be any different?",FortNiteBR

This is good for the entire playerbase AND Epic.,"Let‚Äôs face it. The skill level has increased. It isn‚Äôt an early season anymore where you can have no idea how to build anything except a 1x1 but still compete with anybody.

New players do not stand a chance. Bad players who aren‚Äôt new are probably not having as much fun. People have already stopped playing because getting fucked by someone better than you every game isn‚Äôt fun. ‚ÄúJust play Disco Domination!‚Äù That isn‚Äôt a Battle Royale, though. What if people want to play a BR still?

Competitively, I loved playing in the in-game tournament because of the skill based matchmaking. Near the end after I was getting points, I saw multiple pros in my lobby. I didn‚Äôt see a single ‚Äúbot.‚Äù Every fight was difficult. For me, pubstomping bad players doesn‚Äôt make me improve. And it makes the people I kill frustrated and they often stop playing. 

A ranked gamemode where you earn higher ranks based on your performance would solve this problem. Bad players could play other bad players and have more fun. Competitive players could play other comp players and actually improve. No need for scrims anymore. 

And to answer a few rebuttals:

‚ÄúActually I have a .1 KD but I love getting killed in pubs by people 50x better than me!‚Äù

You are the exception, not the rule.

‚ÄúWhat if you want to pubstomp, or want to play against better opponents?‚Äù

Ranked mode should not be the only mode. The normal mode should still be an option.

‚ÄúWhat about smurfing?‚Äù

Smurfing will always happen. Still, a ranked mode will be improvement over the current gamemode. Smurfing won‚Äôt be rampant enough to make ranked significantly worse. CS:GO made it so you had to connect a phone # to an account to play ranked. That somewhat helped the smurf problem. (Smurfing is a good player playing on an account with a low rank so he can shit on bad players)

‚ÄúHow would duos / squads work?‚Äù

Average rank of everybody in your party will be the one you are pitted against. 

**TL;DR: Right now, good players don‚Äôt improve from killing bad players in public lobbies. Bad players get frustrated and stop playing. Epic gets less money. This is a lose-lose-lose. Let‚Äôs make it a win-win-win.**",FortNiteBR

I'd like to start by stating that this post isn't made to bash on EPIC Games.

I'm gonna be stating my opinion about the game and what's happening. Players are playing less and less!

**The meta changes**

‚Ä¢ This is a very important topic. The meta used to change every season: Remember ""just build lol""? Building got nerfed, meta changed.

Then the double pump shotgun meta came, then it got nerfed. SMG meta came, nerfed again. This was okay, since the game would've died if the meta wouldn't have changed. But now, meta changes every two weeks instead of every season/month and a half. Explosived get buffed, next update they nerf them but they add glider redeploy, they remove items that are okay(like bouncers), then add the jetpack 2.0 aka balloons, they just can't balance it because there are way too many items. The guided missile should've never been added in that state.

**Weekly updates and bad thinking at EPIC**

At BR launch, weekly updates were a great idea. The game getting constant support and EPIC being communicative with the community was amazing, but these weekly updates should include bug fixes, not balloons, not more random weapons, not zombies, not unnecessary changes like the glider redeploy or explosive damage thru walls. BUG FIXES.

They're trying to please casual players(as in gamers that try most games but leave one if a ""better"" one launches) by adding a large weapon pool and mostly by nerfing building and making easy to do tasks easier(like nade launcher spamming). RDR2 launched, BO4 launched, some of the casual playerbase switched to them and the actual playerbase is left with spamming grenades like madlads trying to hit someone.

Where are the big build fights? I haven't seen any in a long time, not on PC, not on PS4. There's no more killing someone in a build fight anymore. When's the last time you thought ""I'll destroy the bottom by using a bouncer to get down safely and make the enemy take fall damage!""? Somewhere about 3-5 months ago, because you couldn't just jump anywhere to leave with your glider. You couldn't port-a-rift. It was more complicated and it usually ended up in someone getting eliminated and someone surviving. Now it's just ""No point in engaging, I'll just glide to leaky and fly somewhere else.""

I'm really thinking about the future of this game. Where can it possibly go? I've seen a few posts about EPIC killing Paragon and probably doing the same with Fortnite. With its massive success, they have to change something to bring that something they had at the start - the building. It was one of the reasons the game got massive success, alongside the item shop, the battle pass and some other stuff. I love the game, I just can't bother to play it in its current state.

That's all. ^^^^may ^^^^Kevin ^^^^rip.

#Event information:

So as most of you are aware there will be a on-time event that will be happening today in game. This was posted and confirmed by EPIC in [this tweet here](https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1058044009942261760). The event will be starting at 1PM EST (6PM UTC). The Fortnitemares challenges will also be ending at this time too. The event is suspected to be about the cube at loot-lake but this is not confirmed, you will only be able to view the event in normal game-modes and **not** in playground as confirmed in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9tlblr/the_event_on_sunday_should_be_viewable_in/e8y7gtb/).

#Meet-ups

A lot of you would most likely want to meet up and set ahead your plans for the event on where to meet-up. You can comment down below all your meet-ups and event planning to view the event below. If you have any questions about the event such as time zones then you can use this thread to ask others also.

#This weeks topic is: **The Storm**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on the storm to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* Is the storm perfect in the state that it is already in?
* Should the storms speed be increased to combat the wide selection of vehicles and the glider redeployment for faster rotations?
* Is the current damage to players towards the end circles too much or to little?
* Is the ability for players to constantly medkit and survive the last circle a good feature to keep or should it be adjusted?

Every in game event that has occurred (that I‚Äôm aware of) takes place at ridiculous hours of the mornings for Oceania. Todays cube event is happening at 5am my local time (Melbourne, Australia) which means a lot of Oceania will miss the live event because they will be sleeping (it‚Äôs a Monday, we have work/school).

It doesn‚Äôt seem fair that we should have to wake up at ridiculous hours or stay up for extended periods of time to watch a one-time in game event. To fix this problem I have two solutions;

1. Make these world events one-time events for each region. That way everyone, no matter where they‚Äôre from, get to experience the event live or
2. Make the event a few hours later, that way it‚Äôs not too late for the regions with a start time of 5/6pm, and not too early in the morning for areas in Oceania. 

These are probably terrible ideas but I just want to see these events live for once. :)

Sometimes when farming you don't have the critical hit indicator when using the pickaxe.

Reproduction:
Build a decent high ramp, jump off and press space ONCE. Pressing redeploy once makes it so that as soon as you're low enough to the ground the glider automatically deploys.
Hit a tree, you see no hit marker.
Go on the same ramp, double press jump so you instantly deploy.
Hit a tree, you now see the hit marker again.

I've tested this over 10 times.

I also made use of the feedback system but I reckon it would get more attention here. ",FortNiteBR

**Step 1: Find Your Timezone**  
Since this will be on the NA-West server, you need to check your time zone for the time of the cube event! A list of time zones are shown below:  
(All data is from a map by u/Ricekrispypoohead)

Quintana Roo: 1:00 PM  
**(If you wish to participate but your state/province/country is not on here, check out the map by** u/Ricekrispypoohead [**here**](https://i.redd.it/j5uqy1p216w11.png) **to find your time zone).**

**Step 2: Become A Member!**  
Now, it is time for you to become a member, to participate in the event, you should be wearing the **Calamity skin** on **Base Stage** (Just a tank top, shorts, and a leg band) with the clothing color **Purple**. This will help me and the others identify who is a member. If you can, use the **Crossfire** glider and the **Reckoning or Guiding Glow** pickaxe so that can help me out. **Also, this is important, if you see the guy in the description below, mainly just from the skin, dance and you will be fine, or just follow me, if you attack me, I will kill you**  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **I** will be wearing the **Male Plague Doctor Outfit (Plague)** with the **Frozen Shroud** cape. I will use the **Skull Sickle** pickaxe with the **Covered Crusader** glider and the **Virulent Flames** contrail (sorry I'm being so specific, I just want you guys to be able to tell it's me).  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Step 3: Queue Up!**  
The next step is to queue up on the **Na-West** server exactly two minutes before the event starts (I am in California so I will queue at exactly 9:58 AM).  
Here are some tips for queuing up that I saw on a post from u/ITheEqualizer [here](https://preview.redd.it/r7kr3ya7l8w11.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15155076d14b4fce38a1fa31ab879026ffa5b9bb). 

**Step 4: Drop in**  
We will be dropping at the warehouses by Leaky Lake  


[This is where we're dropping \(sorry for the bad photoshop\)](https://i.redd.it/szu580ym3aw11.jpg)

If you see me with the description above of the skin I'm going to wear, land on the rooftops, if you don't see me, just try and survive, but don't hurt anyone unless it's in self defense.

**Step 5: Gather Materials (And Maybe Weapons Just In Case)**  
Gather ALL the materials you can find so we can create a fort! Make sure to get some weapons as well to defend ourselves in case we get attacked (I'll have one) We'll build a small fort to protect ourselves, just make sure everyone can fit in it and we can all see the event.

**Step 6: Watch the event!**  
After all this, its time to watch the event, I wonder what's going to happen.

I really hope you guys participate in this event with me, and it would be really cool if you did, see you guys there!",FortNiteBR

I think it's time to change up the shooting model or it will undeniably kill the game.,"I always find myself and my friends that came from h1z1, pubg, and CSGO to be used to skillful shooting. In that case. No bloom. Where you aim, there the bullet goes. Whether  it's spray patterns or accounting for bullet drop it still took skill, not luck most of the time. Bloom makes your shots go everywhere and there is no way to control unless you take your time to tap fire but it's obvious the fact the the enemy by that time will build up or you will get sniped.

Bloom is killing the game after 1 year of playing with it and just adapting to it, which is impossible because you can't adapt to luck.

Message to EPIC : Why are you focusing on making the game easy to learn and master when you know. Your game is not granted popularity for the next 50 years, the casual gamer will move on undeniably. And the actual competitive and dedicated player that even spent money will want to move away since the game consists of RNG and very very stupid changes to make the game easier and consist of just people that don't take time to learn to play the game but rather pick up something op and dominate. If money is the only thing you find successful in this game, then how about you start making good changes and incentivise learning to play and maybe the more competitive players will decide to stay and maybe spend money? 

Imo. Glider re-deploy was one of the best changes you have made. It completly removes RNG from fights and disengagements and i like that.

**TL;DR** : The shooting model needs a rework to remove RNG completly. Add spray patterns or something similiar to h1z1's shooting model which i find fun and requiring skill. FSA is a very healthy feature  but at it's current state it is way too slow to reset which is very hard to quickly shoot without getting sniped or missing a shot because of bloom not reseting to FSA by the time you try. RNG= kills the game.

I don't think it will be.

The game requires way way way to much luck to be an esport.

Inconsistent damage rates for shotguns.
Insane Blume on all weapons.
No idea what guns your gonna get from a chest.
SMGs are way to overpowered.
Way too easy to get away from a fight.

Fix these things Epic. Make Fortnite great like it was.

I also think they should vault some weapons that are bad or way too good and don't belong in a BR.

Pump Shotgun: Way too low damage, with low fire rate, you usually only hit for like 9 damage.

P90: Do I really need to explain?

195,FrozenEthan,1541307035,9u0yxi,27,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9u0yxi/suggestions_to_stop_losing_players/,1,Suggestions To Stop Losing Players,"Recently I feel like Fortnite really has been hand feeding the bad players, and taking away any interest real gamers have in the game. Every update they add removes skill. It‚Äôs either another nerf to building, a new way to counter building, or someway to get around the map ridiculously fast. I feel like the majority of players who have played since Season 2 would most likely say Season 3 was the best. The battle pass was decent, the meta was consistent, pacing was perfect, and skill was rewarded. But now with recent changes like Balloons and glider redeploy, this makes getting into fights even more of a disadvantage, enabling third partying. The storm should be something scary that you can die to. Now it‚Äôs a joke. If you die to the storm you have to be absolute garbage. Another mishap that really pissed me off was the 35 free tiers some players got. Either give everyone the tiers or nobody the tiers. Imagine these three scenarios: You bought your way to tier 100 the previous day, because you really like Dire and want to use it while it‚Äôs still rare. You probably payed upwards of 50$ and then the next day, you guessed it, everybody else gets those same tiers completely for free. Consider this scenario; you‚Äôve been grinding Fortnite all season long because you really want to get to max tier before everyone else. You take off one day of the entire season, and that morning a ton of people get ahead of you. Same goes for people who bought the bundle. It really pains me to see Epic show they don‚Äôt care about everyone who dedicates time into their game. Just like every time they  change the meta, you feel like all your hard work is gone. Suggestions that most decent players will agree with:

Remove All of these:
Balloons

Glider Redeploy

Shockwave (Replace With Impulse)

ATVs (Keep Golf Karts)

Grappler (Replace With Bouncers, but only allow placement when structure below isn‚Äôt destroyed)

Port A Fortress

Grey Tac (Optionally)

This one might be controversial, but I really think P90s should also be removed.

Reduce amount of damage to structures RPGs do by a tiny bit

If you ever do an event like Fortnitemares, keep the normal gamemode. You wimped out this time because you knew more people would play regular than the crappy event gamemode. Zombies are so annoying.

Reduce spawn rate of six shooters

If you say a skin is an exclusive, don‚Äôt rerelease it. If it‚Äôs seasonal, say seasonal instead of limited edition.

I think all these changes would really benefit the game and add back the charm that the game has really been missing in recent times. All the pros that have moved on will probably give Fortnite another chance, and the game will fill all the old players with nostalgia. Skill will finally be rewarded and new players will have to learn how to be better to perform well. Big surprise right? If you have any other suggestions please comment down below.",FortNiteBR

This theory has three scenarios

background for scenarios 1 and 2: At 1 pm tomorrow Kevin will lose the last bit of liquid it has left,I personally Believe that this ""liquid"" is Kevin's blood. So Sadly if this theory is true Kevin will die at 1 pm tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1:After the liquid reaches loot lakes whole in the center it stays there for a bit. but without Kevin being alive, all of the floating islands( and Kevin) fall to the water,raising it back to the normal water level.Afterwards the update comes out,But during the update something incredible happens the blood from Kevin transforms loot lake into the anticipated ""lava lake""

Scenario 2:All the events of scenario 1 carry out in the same way up until when the islands and Kevin are falling.While Kevin is falling,Enforcers leader/S ""The hunting party"" Creates a giant rift taking away Kevin before it leaves,While this is happening The Enforcer ""Visits"" the visitor And prepares to ""Enforce"" His heavy shotgun into the Vistor's face (hehhehe see what i did there?)

Scenario 3:Kevin explodes sending all of its remains across the map,As the season goes on four events will happen

Number 1:The remains of Kevin will slowly come towards the center of the map

Number 2:Another meteor starts to come towards the fortnite map

Number 3:The visitor starts gathering rifts from rift to goes and rifts remaining from season 5

Number  4:The reason so many items are getting vaulted is because the ""hunting party"" is hunting them down taking them and building another rocket

Near the end of the season all 4 of these will collide and from here i could see four things happening

Number 1:The rocket,The meteor,and Kevin reborn get teleported by the rift creating a whole new map

Number 2:When all of these collide the power is so great it greatly changes our map

Number 3:After they collide it rips a whole in time Allowing you to chose which map from any season to play in

Number 4:Kevin dies and drags fortnite down with it (lol)

&amp;#x200B;

BONUS SCENARIO:

So basically fortnite goes cheetos fritos self deletos

(Lol)

First of all, the career tab. 
I am shocked that epic still hasn‚Äôt come out with a career tab on switch in FIVE months. It really sucks not being able to see your stats, as you can‚Äôt see your KD, your wins, status on global leaderboard, etc. I hate not being able to see my KD. It makes it almost IMPOSSIBLE to try out for good gaming clans/scrim servers(which are their own separate issue). 
Secondly, I think that performance on switch needs a MAJOR update. It‚Äôs almost impossible to keep up in a solid build battle at 30fps with other terrible performance issues. Rendering distance is way shorter than both other consoles, so sniping is way worse than other consoles. Not seeing many skins for performance enhancements is a minor issue(which doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that it needs to be fixed) except for the rare occasion where I tell a squad mate that someone is a default and we rush them and they turn out to be a black knight. Also, the removal of the game capture feature that allowed us to share our clips still hasn‚Äôt been re-implemented. I would record everything that I did that was cool and now for the past 2 seasons I have no proof of cool noscopes, trickshots, or hits overall besides screenshots. I never got any performance bugs while taking clips and reading other posts in the community no one else did either. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the FPS overall though. Switch gets the same FPS as mobile, capped out at 30! An average of 25fps with an occasional 30fps is garbage compared to both of the other consoles, and restricts me overall during fights. I don‚Äôt need anything insane, but I just want to have equality with the other consoles and have 60fps.
Everything said here needs to be fixed, whether it be now or later, it all needs to get taken care of. Nothing else needed to say, your move Epic.
(Also I know Epic has no control over this but the community‚Äôs view of the switch needs to change. Whenever people see that I can build on switch they get surprised, because no one gives switch players a good name, and they don‚Äôt help themselves. FNPL still has not implemented a switch league, and I think that if Epic changes everything I mentioned above, they may think about adding one.)

And yet, it's actually getting big time streamers praising it like it's some kind of god send and it is making me furious to no  end that this low effort trash is actually getting attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**AND IT'S LITERALLY JUST BECAUSE OF FAST MAT GAIN AND LITTLE BLOOM** 

These two factors are single handingly  carrying this worthless trash.......

So epic... since you guys love adding literally every concept ever submitted on this sub (and no this isn't entirely a bad thing) why not finally add these two measly changes to the game. And if it's busted or stupid or whatever, just revert it like you've guys done to bad changes in the past. It's ok if it goes wrong, the game has been through worse (early guided rocket,  early p90, double pump \*was busted shut up\*, jetpacks, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and I am absolutely not saying this is gonna end fortnite or cause any actual competition like pubg or codbr (what pubg should have been months ago) . But it sure as hell says something when two factors in a literal copy paste of a game is enough to get attention from large streamers.

step 2 if you do pick up a gun do the unheard of. DONT SHOOT. picking up the gun can be a good strategy so others cant shoot.

step 3 build up for others. this most likely will be an event at loot lake and be unvisible for others on the map. making a viewing platform will make the event as enjoyable for them as for you.

The other day, I came across a feature to uninstall the other mode from the Battle Royale and the core game, and I was wondering why can I just not uninstall the Battle Royale part and keep the core game on the other mode? I'm confused as to why they also had this set up as so since the other mode came first. I was wondering if Epic could make it an option to uninstall the Battle Royale mode and not the core game, since the Battle Royale is just taking up precious hard drive space. Disappointed about this and I hope this changes. Attached picture of settings below.

Lvl 80 to max him out was absolutely ridiculous, and it's obvious Epic knew it because they changed it for the next two seasons. So I think they should change it to XP and give the challenges to everyone who has the skin again.

I already earned the skin in Season 4, I shouldn't have to reach such a ridiculously high level too.

The idea of it was to remove bloom COMPLETELY and add recoil too all weapons.   


I was browsing through the internet and found an old [tweet](https://imgur.com/VpaFG6M) from late 2017 saying that Epic ""slipped up"" and accidentally added the model too early around Christmas. And it was meant to be added in the early 2018. But now, we are close to 2019. So what happened to that LTM? 

Would you even consider adding it back? Because IMO it would be a great idea to add it and see what the community thinks about it. Because right now, Fortnite has a huge community. We give feedback everyday and love to share our thoughts. So why would it hurt to even consider adding it back for a few days and see what feedback the community gives.

Recoil in this game would be so much more rewarding in my opinion. Because bloom is such a RNG based mechanic. And a really bad player who only has played on PC for a few months. Could out skill a pro player in a AR fight. This mechanic doesn't really feel rewarding in any way to me. Sometimes I literally can not hit a single shot. And sometimes I laser people. And adding recoil to the game would increase the skill gap again and would reward good players in so many ways.

Or what do you think? Would you like to see recoil in the game or do you want bloom to stay?

Please leave your opinions.

You can‚Äôt shoot one dude without 3 more hearing you and landing on top of you mid fight. Yes, they would‚Äôve tried to third party you the same way if redeploy was gone but before they had to run there and wouldn‚Äôt immediately have high ground over me midfight and was so much less frustrating to deal with.

I can‚Äôt fight 1 guy even on drop, without 3 more landing in from the most random angles ever, and even when you kill them all you run out of mats and shield, and just more dudes keep landing on you.

I had a game where I was in paradise where I dropped, 30 people left and I already had 8 kills cause people kept landing on me. I shot one zombie and then 2 dudes landed on top of me while zone was coming and zone was over towards pleasant park... like the fuck?

I originally liked this mechanic too but everyone figured out to use it a lot to third party, I don‚Äôt have a issue with players learning and getting better but I have a issue with having to always handle 3 dudes at once and if you make it out alive, you have no materials or meds and you have to run around with 60hp until just more guys land on you.

Challenges you can‚Äôt easily do in solo can be easily done in 50s. 

(And before you argue ‚ÄúdIsCo wOrKs tOo‚Äù I would like to point out that you can‚Äôt revive in Disco Domination. And in Duos/Squads, most random fill teammates that I encounter have some sort of mental problem that prevents them from going anywhere else besides Tilted or Leaky.)

Whether it‚Äôs the revive challenge, damage challenge, or any other challenge, I preferred 50s to do my challenges leisurely without a fake default or streamer building the Taj Mahal three times over and bombarding me with explosives. Or my teammates deciding to land anywhere else besides the place I suggest and preventing me from completing a challenge. 

50v50 lets me play for fun without going all sweaty and biting my lip while I fight a 12 year old Twitch streamer who trashes me on his stream after I kill him and he decides to start claiming I have aimbot. (And yes, that has happened to me once.) I prefer casual play over competitive play sometimes, and Disco doesn‚Äôt satisfy that need for me as much as 50v50 did.

There might be a lot of flaws in my argument, but that‚Äôs not the point of this. This is just how I personally feel.

Anyone else agree that any type of 50s, Soaring or normal, should be re-enabled? Why or why not? ",FortNiteBR

So as the title says, I and other users, who seem to have in common the fact that we use monitors with inferior res (Less than 1920x1080), have been facing an issue where the reticle appears smaller AND less opaque than everyone else. Which results in FSA becoming unreliable, long-range shots way harder to land and an overall hindered experience. We've had to stick with it for this long and we still have no choice but to play with a bugged reticle. The issue is, the middle dot is pretty much invisible, and it's even worse in FSA mode.  
Here are LOTS of ingame screenshots that show the issue : [https://imgur.com/a/osBt62aH](https://imgur.com/a/osBt62aH)  
Here is a comparative that shows the difference : [https://imgur.com/a/KEffnRO](https://imgur.com/a/KEffnRO)

This issue has been around and reported since 08/08/2018 : [https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/592790-no-middle-dot-crosshair](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/592790-no-middle-dot-crosshair)

It was bumped on a regular basis. I count around 15 other users on this thread alone that have said to experience the issue and that's on this thread alone, knowing that there are not that many people that post on these forums. Others have said to experience this on reddit for example.  
Most likely, EVERY user or at the very least a good amount of us, that have a smaller monitor, experience this.  
A 2nd thread was created with more details : [https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/721798-bugged-reticle-for-inferior-resolution-users](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/721798-bugged-reticle-for-inferior-resolution-users)  
The issue was reported on reddit several times on the main Fortnite BR sub, on twitter, as a private message to epic employees on reddit and using the ingame feedback option.  
I contacted the support as well and I was told to continue provide ingame feedbacks. Which I've been doing since. Many days I've reported this ingame, some times several times a day.  
I've been told 2 times that the info would be passed on : [https://imgur.com/a/i0Ta71T](https://imgur.com/a/i0Ta71T)?  
So much effort since the problem appeared and still nothing.  


I and many users have had to play in these frustrating conditions since the 8th of august. Which was 87 days ago... : [http://howmanydayssince.net/08/08/2018](http://howmanydayssince.net/08/08/2018)

You should have to repair your glider. Time to repair glider could be 10 seconds max.

You should be able to get shot off your glider by taking a certain amount of damage while gliding. 

This would add some necessary risk to redeploy but keep the smoothness of having redeploy.

As of right now you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything and can swoop in without worry.

I think these changes would make it more tactful and would add some counterplay to getting dove on. 

Also would give incentive to hit gliding targets to damage glider which could set up a nice 1v1 for you after they landed. Should balance things out a bit better imo. ",FortNiteBR

I recently bought an S10 for the sole purpose of getting the skin and emote.

I’ll say it again for the people in the back. I literally added a new line to my cell phone plan to buy the device which I will never use just so I can get the skin and emote. It did not hurt my wallet.

Is your financial situation different? Keep your comments to yourself.

Anyways, is the emote tied to only be used in the ikonik outfit or can I use them with, you guessed it, my galaxy skin as well? Im asking because everywhere I look I only see people doing the emote in the ikonik outfit. So are they tied together?",FortNiteBR

It was made before every other shield drinking post was made, but it got removed. Why?

It was on the block.

Even though it had nothing to do with creative, it was still removed anyway.

And another time, a guy was showing a game breaking glitch where you can shoot a rocket through a ramp. And it was removed again. Why?

It was again on the block.

It still had absolutely nothing to do with creative. But, since it had the block on it, the mods decided it had nothing to do with BR.

So what do they expect us to do? Post that bug on the creative forums? The thing is it’s gonna get removed because it has nothing to do with creative and it’s just a bug showcase.

TL:DR don’t remove posts just because they were made on the block or even have the words creative in them. Some people can’t find an RPG in BR since they’re super rare and it’s so much easier to showcase a bug in creative since you’re not hit in the face with BR RNG and the fact that you could get easily killed.",FortNiteBR

The explosion will be massive, leaving a wasteland in place of everything nearby. Next season, the theme will be radioactive and apocalypse.

And you need to listen to the people on this sub. It is becoming a boring sub and it’s because of the rules you invented and the random and inappropriate ways that they are enforced.,"I remember when this sub was AMAZING. It felt like the same crazy energy of fortnite and epic was in this sub. It was a direct extension.  

But now this sub is a pale imitation of its former self.  And the reason is the rules you have invented and the blind and random zeal with which you enforce it.  

This now an highly policed sub that generates the same exact type of content day in day out.  It’s like a news site with updates on weather, business and sports.  It’s boring. And because of the zeal with which posts are removed I dont even want to bother posting ideas that I have because I’m sure it will be a waste of time because you’ll remove the post. And use your poorly written subjective and very broad rules to justify removing it.  I’m sure you can find a silly rule in your encyclopedia of rules to remove this post.  And you probably will. 

But this sub is boring.  And you have made it boring.  And the way you behave reminds me of the mods in the r/nomansskythegsme sub before it literally imploded (the sub was deleted then the admins got involved...it was chaos...look it up if you don’t know about it).  I’m serious. I’m getting deja vu.  And a hallmark feature of that sub before the implosion was mods removing post after post after post while citing a tome of stupid and poorly written rules.  Sound familiar?  


 u:mrpopotfs and u/epicericsw you need to check in on this.  Just because this sub was great before doesn’t mean it won’t turn cancerous.  We all love this game.  Adore it.  It’s why people go through effort to post things here and the mods and their rules are draining all of this positive energy.  They are making on of your best PR tools less effective.  

If this post is removed.  I’m done.  Good bye. I’m not going to waste anymore time here. I’ll just use Twitter",FortNiteBR

It says that siphon was removed due to excess aggressiveness, which is ironic coming from the company that has two variations of the “take the L”, the obnoxious laugh and the salt on wound emotes.  If excessive aggressiveness was a legitimate concern, these emotes would not be in the game as they are toxic/aggressive by design.  With that being said, I’m not sure what the real reason was to remove siphon from pubs/casual games but I think we would all like to know as the one reason that we have been given does not make sense given the aggressive/toxic emotes sold by fortnite. 
To their credit and to appease the siphon supporters Epic offers Arena (which the anti-siphon crowd loves to reference).  However, Arena is not the same as public/casual matches.  At higher levels it has long que times and becomes a hamster ball fest.  Plus a person moves up based simply on eliminations without consideration for how many games it took the person (which is flawed logic in my opinion).  Now that we have gone almost a month or more since 8.20 and the real good players are coming back to public without siphon - we are back were we started before siphon was added in season 7 (it is really difficult for a new or below average player to enjoy the game).  I think a good solution would be to keep the non-siphon mode for pubs (fortnite classic), keep Arena for the competitive e-sport players and add a public solo version with siphon.  By having three options - each type of fortnite player would have a mode in the fortnite universe that suits their mood and skill level.  I would guess the newer and/or below average players would play the classic version, while average to above average players would enjoy the mode with siphon and the really demented would prefer Arena.  This seems like a win-win for the players and epic.  Lastly, hamster balls have got to go - I was watching the end of a public game tonight and 3 of the last four players were In hamster balls.  It was ridiculous and it was not the fortnite that captured the gaming world’s  imagination.  I understand, as streamers such as Sypher have pointed out, that there may be some end-game performance benefits for keeping hamster balls in the game, but they are not good for the game.  There are obviously a lot of talented people at epic - surely they can figure out a better solution than hamster balls.
Just so you know, I making this post as a big fan of fortnite and am hoping that somehow these suggestions will get before decision makers for consideration.  My fear is that fortnite will die in my lifetime and I won’t be able to play the game that I have found endlessly entertaining.  I just want to do whatever I can to try influence epic to continue offer the best fortnite experience(s) that it can. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

I was left with 1,250 V-Bucks to use however I wanted. Later today when the shop updated, as I was checking out the new skins, I accidentally purchased the Hopper (of course it had to be such an ugly skin). Now I’m stuck with 50 V-Bucks and a skin I don’t want all because Epic thinks it’s a good idea to give us 3 refunds to last us seemingly until the end of time. Even 1 refund per season could work. Or, as countless people on this sub have suggested in the past, a “confirm purchase” button to avoid situations like this one. Not to mention the fact that the reason I accidentally purchased the skin was because I wanted to see the selectable styles, which on Xbox is X in the locker. In the shop, however, X is used to purchase items. I’m not necessarily saying this is a tactic to get people to accidentally buy things, but it definitely couldn’t hurt to make the buttons the same. Just seems like Epic is either doing this on purpose or they’re simply ignorant, but considering the amount of posts I’ve seen about the same or similar issues, I doubt that’s the case. I’d love to know what everyone else thinks about this issue. It could be that I’m blowing it out of proportion because I’m mad about having a skin I don’t want, who knows.",FortNiteBR

Console players will never be at the same level of pc players no matter what anyone says. 

First, the amount of “great” pc players vastly outnumbered the amount of “great” console players. So much in fact whenever a console player goes into the competitive scene they are (most of the time) the only ones. This sets up my argument

Second, console players have a major disadvantage at having only one finger to control the most important aspects of ANY shooter game, being moving and aiming. Pc players with a flick of the wrist can do a 360 and still land hits with precision. While console players have to move their thumb right and and back and then react to whatever. This is of course a major disadvantage as they can move across screen astonishingly fast while being accurate, while console has to look at he target and move one finger to such target and when such target moves has to recollect and react with what happened. You could simply say “Up your sensitivity.” But it does not work like that on consoles. (This is hard to explain, so y’all prolly are going to be mad confusion when reading that mess^^)

My third point being is the massive frame rate indifference there is. Yes some PCs are garbage and will have the same or even lower frame rate compared to console. But being said if a console player is in one of those games where in the end everyone is not trying to die and is building, frame rates for consoles dip. But a more major issue is that things appear faster for pc (obv) but a frame, can make a significant difference in a gun fight, build fight, etc. Seeing every detail as fast as possible can make someone significantly better.

My fourth and probably the most important point, that I see no one talking about is the time difference when clicking a controller and when clicking the button on the mouse. It’s a small very small difference but it changes everything. Grab a mouse and then grab a console controller, one in your left and one in the right. Tap both at the same time as quick as possible and you will feel that the mouse is slightly faster. This may seem to some of you, as insignificant. But think of it this way, a console player and a pc player are standing across from each other, both press their selective buttons at the same time, the pc player wins. This may seem uncommon but, how many times have you complained that you shot first, or that the person who killed you m u s t ‘ v e predicted where you were, or above all he just was faster (Nah). 

As a pc player drops from above you, he turns towards you, sees you faster, and clicks at the same time as you. You die ofc. As you watch as he default dances on you, you click to go to the next game. The same thing happens.

Of course this is just a theory, a GAME THEO..
But, this is an opinion. I play console but have played on Pc. I’m garbage at pc, and I consider my self above average on console. Unpopular Opinion: Console players will always lose to pc players. How to deal with it? Simple, switch to pc or delete the game. Which I would never do. I will continue to play in arena being SO close to the champions league, but yet not making it because I get into a lobby of pc players. Therefore I write a Reddit post complaining about how ridiculous the skill gap is. But hey what do I know.",FortNiteBR

It's wacky but there are issues.

1. Red supply drops don't appear on map. Other LTMs have those, and it's easy to fix by adding them.
2. Make supply drops and items float on lava, especially red supply drops if the circle is over Loot Lake or Lazy Lagoon.
3. Add regular supply drops that come in waves, always landing on the indestructible roof.
4. Once the mascot has been destroyed, the remaining mascot will decay at faster rate to bring the game towards sudden death quicker.
5. Have all players be under constant slurp juice effect for health only. Eliminating opponents will restore shields.
6. Enable glider re-deploy but only if you manually jump and platform doesn't break under your feet. If teammate shoots down the floor, you're eligible to redeploy.
7. Add unlimited-use vending machines to both of the floating bases to be able to dispense weapons and consumables in exchange for materials. Kinda like Bed Wars! All weapons from vending machines are Legendary.
   * Consumable Vending Machine: Shield Potion (wood), Slurp Juice (stone), Chug Jug (metal)
   * Trap Vending Machine: Spike Trap, Cozy Campfire, and Launch Pad
   * Weapon Vending Machine #1 (long range): Thermal Scoped AR, Suppressed Sniper Rifle, and Hand Cannon
   * Weapon Vending Machine #2 (medium range): SCAR, Suppressed SCAR, and Suppressed Pistol

First, I'd like to give some background.  I did not get the Omega Lights either.  

I really did and still do want the Omega Lights.  I researched all possibilities that the Omega challenges might return, but found nothing but clickbait YouTube videos (sometimes, I really hate the Fortnite community smh).  I reached out to Epic Games directly to see if they could re-enable the challenges for me, but they explained that they could not make exceptions.  I even looked into buying an account and merging it with my own just so I could have the Omega Lights.  

In my attempts to get the final tier of the Omega skin, I came up with some interesting facts and arguments over this mildly controversial topic. Epic is most likely not going to bring back Omega challenges and here's why:

Epic Games is not interested in implementing things that do not
     a) increase FortniteBR's player count or
     b) add an incentive for people to buy more skins or in-game items.

Epic Games is a business, they are only interested in making money.  And really, that's what a business should be doing.  If Fortnite didn't make any money, nobody would bother to make it.  The only reason I can see that Epic would allow players to unlock the Omega Lights would be to put an end to people selling accounts.  However, even if they re-added the Omega challenges, people would still sell accounts with the Black Knight or something.  

I hate to crush the hopes of everyone who never got the Omega Lights.  I completely empathize with you, but it's not going to happen, so please stop spamming this subreddit with complaint posts and get over it.",FortNiteBR

I am now able to expand on it a bit more after covering some stuff up/ confirming some stuff.

The thing that comes out of the vortex in the sky will be the Storm King (he appeared in StW). He will have a slightly different appearance due to the damage he sustained from his “defeat” in StW. The mechanics on how he will be fought will also be different from StW. 

The reason for him coming to BR is because the main story leads decided that at some point, the two modes would need to crossover but weren’t sure how. The Storm King was their solution.

I also learned that this is basically going to trigger the “end of the map”. I put that in quote marks because they want to keep the map, but still have some kind of end of the world type of thing happen. From what I’ve heard, they have went with the idea of  the Storm King ravaging the island, destroying main points of interest. Once defeated, everyone will be teleported to the in-between (the place that players were taken when Kevin exploded, the white place with those tubes) where we will once again be greeted by the butterfly, who will take the player towards one of the floating orbs of light. Inside that orb of light is the map before loot lake was dug up. This will allow both maps to be playable at once. The destroyed map will be reshaped and rebuilt, posing as the new map. This will mean two storylines at once. 

I can confirm a military POI too. Don’t except it too last long though as it will be built right next to the site where the Storm King will begin his rampage. I don’t deal with the art department too much so that’s the only POI I know about as of current.",FortNiteBR

Please only read and comment if you are interested in discussing competitive settings and general priorities for Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

General:

* Audio improvements or rework
* Remove edit delay
* Turbo build delay back to 0.05s
* Buggfix for traps
* Performance improvements and stability

&amp;#x200B;

Competitive mode:

* Vaults

1. Heavy Sniper *(unhealthy mechanics with little counterplay)*
2. Boom Bow *(damage to high, no soundqueue, easy to hit)*
3. Grenade Launcher *(basically spam explosives, do not belong in a competitive environment)*
4. Scoped Revolver *(polluting the lootpool)*
5. Normal Pistol  *(polluting the lootpool)*
6. Tactical Shotgun -&gt; to be replaced with heavy shotgun (*making all shotguns viable early/mid/late)*
7. Normal Scar  *(M16A4, Silenced Scar, AK build a very balanced AR pool)*
8. Infantry Rifle *(little use, polluting the lootpool)*
9. Scoped AR *(again, sees almost no use)*
10. Thermal Scope *(well again)*
11. Turret  *(...)*
12. Ballers *(no words needed)*

&amp;#x200B;

* Adjustments

Went to go get the challenge done myself for my buddy and me, and right as I was about to hit the last number, the guy gunned us down.

Every update in the last couple months has contributed to more and more bugs and more frame drops. After today, I cannot build at all without frames dropping from 60 to 9. Literally, dropping down between 9-21 FPS every 5-10 seconds of building. My frames drop down to 25 when I'm just farming trees. I also played a couple games yesterday where the entire server kept freezing.

Here's a list of bugs still unaddressed in the game. Note, I have a fiber optic wired connection and I'm on a PS4 Pro.

1. Ghost shots

2. Random jump fatigue

3. Getting shot around corners and behind cover

4. Aim assist feels weaker at close ranges

5. Audio...I don't even know where to begin. There are random ghost sounds of reloading, equipping weapons, and healing wherever you run even though no one is there. Trees make a sound like they're being hit after you've run away from them. Wall destruction is nearly impossible to hear. Directional audio makes it difficult to impossible to determine another player's location

6. No aim assist in a bush

7. Pump and sniper not shooting

8. Building delay when trying to build after being in trap mode

9. Traps have delayed placement

10. Getting shot literally through walls

11. Shadows on console - at least an attempt was made to make it easier to see, but it's still extremely difficult to see other players in shadows

12. Getting stuck inside ramps - other players can phase through your ramps easily, so it seems like that's the intended mechanic, but you can somehow still get stuck inside ramps and be unable to move

13. Phasing - after last week's update, phasing was changed to address an issue where players could edit/reset a floor and be phasing through it still. However, now players are phasing through builds even more than before

14. Frame drops - seriously, it's impossible to play

I think replacing Team Rumble with any other big team mode is a big mistake for Epic on these times. Team Rumble could become a permanent mode and it would always be a popular mode and a fun mode. Food Fight just lacks those traits which is why not many people like it.

And of course, challenges. We want to unlock Ruin but with this mode currently it's very hard to do challenges, especially those that mention map locations. Team Rumble has no big barrier in the middle, it's just straight up death match and nothing else which is why it's perfect for challenges.

The Food Fight Ltm wasn't ever good since it came out and thsi time with all these bugs it's proven Epic just threw it in the game for no reason and called it a day.",FortNiteBR

Like it was 5v1 in the end, I build across trying to get over and a dickhead knocked me down and I die to fall damage. Real fucking funny. Like let people try out the mode.

The end game is literally worse than 50v50 hide and seek. Searching for that 1 guy in like how many layers and layers of builds? Then dumb asses shoot each other's building dropping team mates into the Lava. Let other people try to enjoy the mode that enjoys it, rather than ruining it. 

Maybe the mode might be a bit more enjoyable if there was redeploy. Who in the right bloody mind thought of inifinite grappler.. It forces people to cluster fuck rather than spreading out. I rather glide and take 15 dmg to reposition myself than get shot down. It also might make the game a bit faster.. rather than dragging to 20 mins+

A lot of people say heavy snipers are fair since they have a long reload time, but if you're sitting in a 1x1 in the middle of zone, you have all the time you need.

I farm 999 wood every game but since there's no shield per kill (or even shield in general), I end up using a large chunk of that wood in a fight. Then, you have half the lobby literally just hiding behind rocks and trees waiting to bop somebody or to simply third party a fight. The game has become insanely slow-paced and campy.

I quit end of season 7 and recently heard about “arena mode” sounds great, fight people in a ranked mode.

I load up Fortnite for the first time in a month (previously played 6-12 hours everyday since release) to give it a try and hear on a YouTube video that console players are again forced to play against PC players.

Instantly closed fortnite.

Why is this so hard? 

Console v console 

Pc v pc 

Switch v switch 

Mobile v mobile 

Unless I opt in to play Pc players it shouldn’t be a thing. It’s honestly ridiculous and one of the many reasons people quit this game.

Only people that will disagree are bad pc players who want easy kills against a console player with a inferior machine and peripherals.",FortNiteBR

Because here's the facts. It cost Epic virtually nothing to create the skin. The cost of artists and programmers. Once the skin is designed Epic distributes it digitally just like any other skin. 

The exclusivity is fabricated. The skin has no more inherent value than any other skin in the game. In terms of supply and demand Epic has an infinite supply and very high demand due to the exclusivity. 

Epic literally has us by the balls. They did it with the Galaxy skin. They're doing it now with the IKONIK skin. And they'll do it in the future with some other skin. It's bullshit. 

They get away with it because it's a promotional skin to sell Galaxy S10 phones. The problem with that is as the phones become obsolete over time, the skins will still retain their exclusivity.

Personally, I feel like it's the perfect mode for casuals, and it always seems weird how Epic seems to insist on removing it despite the fact that many people want it to be a permanent fixture of the game. Heck, even people who dislike the mode would probably agree that it's the best for doing challanges (like traveling to three different pirates camps, or some of the race missions). I know we have Food Fight now, but I don't think it compares to TR. Especially with some of the changes made to that mode, like how you can no longer see the arrow over teammates, or the fact that everyone seems to be using Peely so you have no idea who's on which team. Plus, just in general, the mode isn't that fun. Constantly having to float down after getting while you were sitting in box for 5 minutes shooting one of the mascots isn't exactly my idea of exciting game-play, but that's just me.",FortNiteBR

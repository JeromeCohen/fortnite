I do feel like I'd spend more money if the skins were seemingly better. Now, I'm not saying the skins are bad. No no way. I wish not to be downvoted to -5000. I'm simply saying that the success Epic has, it is kind of disappointing seeing the same tactics shittier companies used such as \*cough\* Bluehole ( pubg ) with their mmorpgs just sell reskins and different colored mounts etc.

I hate Fortnite with a burning passion and consider the only good point of it is to attract 10 years old kids elsewhere than the games I like. So let's explain why the game is bad and why I don't understand his popularity.I will do by order of triggering the 1rst trigger me the least and the 4rth make me mad.

# 1#the RNG is everywhere!

RNG aka ""random generated number"" is what make all the in game random things.when in good doses it can be fun make the game more interesting. But in fortnite everything is submitted to RNG the loots(that ""acceptable"") to the damages. That just unacceptable for any multiplayer game to use that kind of RNG(damages) and that make the game feel a lot more like a test of luck than anything else.

# 2#no gameplay depth

If there's something that can make a game good it's his gameplay depth : the fact that a mechanic have multiple level of understanding and mastering. Ex : in Mario 64( a game with a good movement pallet) you can do basic jump that don't go that far but with a good mastering of the jump mechanic you can cross big gaps. In fortnite the only mechanic that could have a learning curve was the building mechanic ; keyword could : the building mechanic have a flat learning curve and little to no effect on the other mechanics. The only two use are move and shield that all.

# 3# the game abuses on dirty tricks to keep the player and make him spit his money

that maybe the point that make me so triggered about this game it's use more dirty tricks to gain money than EA.

So let's list them :

FIRST) the fact that the game aim directly kids. Do I seriously need to explain ; if you want someone the spit you his wallet in his face use there kids and voilà : a million dollars a month.

SECOND)the game keep putting the buy-able content on the face. This one is not hard to understand : more you see it more you want it.

THIRD)regular """"""""""""content"""""""" updates. That make the game feel a bit new and cooler without doing that much.

# 4# the community more toxic than undertale fandom

what is a fandom : it's a community but 10X more horrible. 

this is maybe with the 3# the reason I've loose all faith in a brighter future.

Fortnite community is made of kids that are immature, dumb, and horrible that will invade every other community for there games without understanding completely how much we want to murder them. Maybe there's some adult  and mature peoples here but everything I saw outside of reddit  (I'm not even joking)   was some 10 years old garbage without any braincells. If you're less than 16 take a minute to think about all the people that hate you, despise you, and consider you like garbage because you've used Fortnite poses IRL(I'm that kind of person).",FortNiteBR

This is for all platforms because I know they all have some sort of optimization flaw that could be improved. 

For those who cannot afford a decent build to maintain 60 FPS even with low settings, I do not know how you can play this game. 

Ever since season 4, my FPS has gone down a little bit after each patch. It’s really annoying to not have a smooth gameplay experience throughout the whole game. If they could optimize popular places like tilted or the floating island I feel like it would help a lot of people with frames. 

I honestly would like Epic to slow down on releasing skins and focus more on optimizing the game as it is still in ‘early access’.

I saw you coming.

I saw you from a fucking mile away.

As I downed one of the last opponents and built a wall around him so I could finally - FINALLY - get that trap elimination

I saw you coming

Oh yes. I fucking SAW THE THIRST IN YOUR EYES.

Even though you wouldn't get credit for the elimination, something in your heart just drove you to do the dumbest goddamn thing i've ever seen.

You broke my trap and shot the guy twice. No credit. No recognition. No stat boost or increase to our chances of winning. Just fucking raw stupidity.

And I hate you for it.

For days I've struggled not to get the trap elimination itself, no. I've struggled to FIND the damn things. I've tried staying out of the circle in 50v50. I've tried staying in the fights for the entire match. I've tried solos, duos, the lot.

But I can't fucking find the things. Not until today. The end of that round was the biggest fucking rush I've had in a long time - realizing that maybe, just maybe, I had the opportunity to finally get that fucking trap elim. 

But you.

You my friend.

I hate you.

I don't hate much. Very few things in fact. But you're an exception.

I don't even tend to get mad at videogames, especially not this one; it's too silly and fast-paced to stay mad.

That changed today.

My rage is boundless and I cannot be consoled.

May your buildbattles forever end in you falling off your own tower.

Sincerely,


A slightly disgruntled teammate",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing since mid Season 3. I thought for sure I would have improved by now, but that obviously was not the case.  


I've tried finding decent videos on YouTube for tips, but the videos I've found are your typical 10:01 long videos of them repeating the same obvious things just to drag the video on for their YouTube money.   


Here are some issues that I'm aware of.  


1. I don't have a desk or anything to play on. I have a laptop so I have it on a laptop tray in front of my bed and I have to use my keyboard and mouse on my bed.
2. I choke easily. The moment I get into a fight, I get nervous and move my mouse around too much and can't hit a shot.
3. SMGs. I can't counter them. I actually just raged quit from playing with friends because each game I've played tonight, I was killed by an SMG because nobody knows how to use a weapon other than that.
4. Back to the choking. Whenever I encounter an enemy and they start building, I just get so nervous and intimidated by how fast people can build and edit. Within seconds someone can already build and edit through a wall and finish me off so quickly.

A few more things that I don't understand: 

1. I'll be crouched, not moving, and my crosshair will be on an enemy. Even if this enemy is not moving, my shots don't hit. I don't hold down my mouse to fire, I do single taps to shoot for more accuracy. 
2. I was just playing the new Disco mode with a friend. I snuck up behind someone with my blue pump shotgun, aimed at their head, yet only did 7 damage. This person then turned around and eliminated me with a tactical shotgun with only one shot. ***Excuse me, but what?***

I love Fortnite and it's fun to play with friends. But it's getting to the point now where I just feel like I'm a burden for the squad when I choke so easily and miss my shots after playing so long. If anyone has any legitimate tips for me, or even helpful videos that aren't just clickbait that they could share with me, I'd greatly appreciate it.",FortNiteBR

The shop is updated every day at 8pm with new featured skins coming every Thursday and Saturday. New skins get leaked bi-weekly (enough to fill 2 Thursdays and 2 Saturdays with new skins). If any of you have seen the latest leak, you'll realize that there are only 3 days worth of featured items instead of 4 (bullseye won't be a featured skin since she's uncommon). Seeing as how that's the case, I guarentee that means we will be getting ghoul trooper either this Thursday, or this Saturday. Since she's already in the files, it would make since that she wouldn't get leaked. If they decide to add in alternate styles or give her a pickaxe or glider, they'll do so with a hotfix.

My own theory is that they will release a set of challenges for ghoul trooper to unlock a back bling, and maybe if you complete both the skull trooper and Ghoul Trooper challenges, you'll get the scythe. I know that's a stretch, but you have to understand that Epic bases all their idea and changes off of the mentality of ""how can we do this in a way that we'll get the most money?"" ",FortNiteBR

This kinda irked me because the styles weren’t even partially unlocked. I truly believe this is kind of a gimmick for the future seasons. 

In the past, Everyone was upset that they couldn’t unlock the final stage of Omega. So season five allowed for the Ragnarok to be unlocked overtime no matter what season. This was the greatest idea of the EPIC  if they were to continue this route.

Now I do frequent Reddit often, I have seen plenty of post reguarding the grind is too much for these styles in the past. Seeing as most of you don’t purchase tiers, By the time that you actually reach tier 100 you have to unlock each style for the skin from the moment you obtain tier 100. 

So by The end of the season you should be close to if not already at tier 100. Basically to sum it up you’re going to be tier 100 again in  season 7 before you unlock all the styles for season six.

I don't know how you trigger the bug but it happens frequently, it happens to at least me or one person I am facing once a game.

You can see that you have the bug when you receive damage to your health when there is still one shield left.

You can also see that an enemy has the bug when your shots deal exactly 1 damage less than they should.

Here are some examples:

[I hit him for 18 on shield and then 19 off shield](https://i.imgur.com/KgfBuHb.jpg)

[I hit him twice for 26 and then twice for 25](https://i.imgur.com/Kti2myq.jpg)

[I sniped him for 89 with a gun that's supposed to deal 90 damage](https://i.imgur.com/n4YX9Hp.jpg)

[Here I shoot someone with a deagle that's supposed to deal 75 damage](https://i.imgur.com/sALdWga.jpg)

[Here I shoot someone for 33 and then 32](https://i.imgur.com/bIsW0lm.jpg)

[Here I shoot someone for 31 with a gun that should do 32 damage](https://i.imgur.com/CnUopv5.jpg)

Damage dropoff is out of the equation as there are 4 different damage values, none of which are 1 damage below the point blank range.

If you still don't believe me, I have 2 clips that are proof of this bugs existence.

[Here's the first clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/IntelligentTawdryNigiriDansGame)

Dakotaz is at 100 health and 28 shield, then he drinks a mini to get to 150 then kills a guy and walks into 2 traps, which at the time should have done 75 damage each. Notice that he survives with 1 health and 1 shield.

[Here's the second clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/OpenOutstandingCockroachFloof)

Winter drinks 2 halfpots to get to 100 shield and then tanks 2 grenades, each of which should deal 100 damage, he survives the first grenade with 100 health and 1 shield

In both clips, the players didn't use slurp juice, you can check winters vod [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/322407156) , he initiates the fight at 00:19:45

I don't know how this bug works or when it's triggered, but the fact that there is a bug in the game, that makes players deal less damage than they should is unacceptable.

I can safely say that I have survived numerous fights because people did less damage to me than they should have.

If you know why or how this happens please comment about it.

1. All ammo types should be capped at 500. 
This would make it so you could not spam with the mini gun or ARs or SMGs. 

2. Have a heavy weapon system similar to exotics in destiny.
This would make it where you would only be able to have one heavy weapon (GL, RPG, Minigun) at a time which would counter rpg/minigun spam by the same person.

3. Last, make it so the minigun overheats after 100-150 and requires cool down time, I’ve seen this suggested before but I’m restating it.

The worst feeling that's starting to happen a lot lately is ramp rushers.

If a player tags an unsuspecting enemy at a good distance, out in the open, for 40+hp, that enemy should not be able to ramp rush the shooter with confidence.

I've seen it happen too often lately where a players tactical advantage IN COMBINATION WITH getting first shots on the enemy, results in getting ramp rushed with ease.

This feels wrong and should not be possible in the game.  I take no issue with defensive building as the games called FORTnite but offensive building has got to be removed from the game.

Tactics should matter in a game like this.",FortNiteBR

Epic, when it comes to skin's, Hollowhead is probably THE laziest skin we have seen yet, for many reasons. Here lately it seems like we are getting more and more recolors as shop skins then unique skins, This goes back all the way to the getaway ltm. You have several recolors when it comes to cuddle team leader, john wick (the getaway skin plus the new jack gourd skin) and here recently you have come out with the new bundle that is essentially raptor but blue (which you already did with the twitch prime pack 1), and now Hollowhead.. Honestly A headless horsemen style pumpkin head skin could have had so many good concepts and ideas behind it, but it just seems there was no real effort on your part to try and do any better then a recolor, and it is made even worse when you look at it alongside how much you have been pushing Skull Trooper/ranger the past week.. I mean no other skin has been in the shop this long at one time, and it just so happens to be one of the most hyped skins in the game.. When you look at it like that, it adds to the frustration that there seems to be a sort of laziness when it comes to other Skins as of right now. Ultimately, there are going to be people who like these skins, and who will buy them, which is awesome for them, i wont be because i dont feel they are worth it, but that isnt really what this post is about. It is meant to be about how it seems you are starting to slip down a slope of putting in the minimal effort, and still getting paid a decent amount of money to do so. I am not just saying that ""Oh epic games is just money hungry"" But it definitely makes it harder to defend against that argument when you are doing things like this.. There are plenty of awesome fan skin concepts that have been thrown around on the subreddit for months, i am sure any number of them would have had no problem with you using their concept to be put into the real game, i know i wouldn't mind. I know that you could be working on some awesome unique skins as we speak, but at the time of writing this, there isn't much, and that is partially where my concern is coming from right now. At the end of the day, Recolors can be fine, but they need to be done in moderation, and they need to be done really well, otherwise it comes off an attempt at a cash grab, and ultimately, i just feel that with all the attention Skull trooper has getting, you kind of set other skins for this years halloween by the wayside. Of course i could be wrong about all of this within the next week or so, but we will see.

TL:DR. It feels like Epic is doing more and more recolors as of late, which feels lazy and makes currently halloween skins feel lackluster in comparison to the attention skull trooper is getting, and epic needs to fix this otherwise they risk making their image of being a cash grabbing, money hungry gaming company worse in the eyes of its player base as a whole.",FortNiteBR

(which i feel would still be very strong in comparison but it's diversity to say the least) there are a few downfalls to this being that the double barrel may be objectively stronger (not sure on this considering the range etc.) as would a single shotgun + smg in current state,  the unnatural feeling of not being rewarded for hitting headshots, although i feel this would be expected by the user if you're running double pump etc. it comes with the downfall which i think is completely fair, also i'm not really sure how they would implement this consistently, for example if you picked up 2 shotguns early game to deny somebody else one you would instantly be put at a disadvantage based on this idea.  


There's a lot of upside and downsides, i've thought about it a bunch, because i couldn't really think of any other ideas other than buffing shotgun damage as a whole or implementing a more complex damage chart, for example being point blank in somebodys face gives you X amount of bonus damage (even for body shots).  


This is just an idea, i'm not 100% on it myself i'm just speculating as it seems such a controversial thing in the community right now and i don't feel like EPIC tried to compromise that much as a whole before completely removing it from the game with the current delay, please let me know you think and/or put your own ideas down, it seems like this has a been a massive issue for a majority of the playerbase (in terms of disagreement) and there tends to be a lot of conflict when this conversation comes up absolutely everywhere that you read!

     I just went on a huge session of research and I learned something big about the Dire tier 100 skin. 

     Let's start with last season. Last season was quite obviously based on Norse mythology, but everyone thought that that had ended. I think not.

     Ragnarok was the huge thing last season, this season, it's a little  inconspicuous. We really don't know the theme...But, I think it's still Norse, with a touch of Halloween.

     Now, Epic played pretty smartly I believe by putting Red Riding Hood in this battle pass, but that was a trick. They wanted us to believe that Dire was the wolf in the story, but Dire is a whole other story.

     Fenrir is the bringer of Ragnarok in Norse mythology, which oh so happens to be a wolf. You want a bonus, which I don't think is a coincidence? Well, first let me tell you about Dire wolves.

     Dire wolves are way more ferocious than regular wolves. They're bigger, stronger, everything. Now, Fenrir, is so big, that in the story, he's thought to touch the sky when he opens his mouth. But, that was just a metaphor to human troubles and their extensiveness. However, that doesn't change what Fenrir is, or what he's believed to be.

     He is believed to be a Dire wolf, so... What do you think?

So bassically I think once you kill a player their builds should turn into yours. You would be able to edit their walls place traps on their builds and existing traps placed by the player wouldnt hurt you. 

Overall i think this would just improve gameplay and I have a few key things it would help with.

1: editing down from build fights. After a build fight tou generally wanna get down as fast as possible. Especially if your being shot down.

2. Last minuite traps. So often enough to notice ill push someone, pump them, but right as im shooting them with my sub or whatever I have to follow up they trap me. So out of the fight no one really wins. Its just a pointless engagement where both players go back to the lobby. This is especially annoying in duos or squads. Youll kill the guy but the trap will down you. If its on a wall you could survive but if they place it on the floor of the 1 by 1 your basically dead. 

Now I get they may have out skilled but its just so pointless. No one wins the fight in this situation. Its barely even out skilling. Its panicking placing a trap and dieing. 

What do you guys think. And thanks for reading.

### Introduction to Focused Feedback

Focused feedback will be a thread made every week to discuss a certain topic such as an item in game and discuss its place in the current meta, any issues it may have and how it could be improved or nerfed to match the game standards. These threads are aimed to isolate the main discussion and concerns about whatever topic is set for that week and to keep it within the thread.

We are going to be making these Focused Feedback threads every week with a new topic to discuss and have meta type discussion within this thread.

We have also created a focused feedback [wiki page](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/focusedfeedback) which will be updated with all the weekly threads and you can find all the topics on here as the weeks go by.

The type of discussion we expect to see in these threads would include:

* Its current state in the game
* Improvements which could be made
* Any negative alterations which could be made
* If something needs to be removed completely and the reasoning why
* general feeling and community consensus of the current topic

---

#### The first topic we would like to focus on this week is: **grapplers**

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

Discuss what you really enjoy or really dislike about it, any and all conversation/feedback is welcome and accepted.

Keep discussion relating to the topic set, any irrelevant content would be subject to removal. Please remember that the [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/rules) still apply.

After he got into mid school (between elementary school and high school) he found a friend...then another one and the number keeps going up Untill Root for 16 friends... And he was happy until fortnite got popular...

He was going to college and get lessons from the doctors and after noon he goes to his house and play ps4 with his friends...there was no argument...just *Fun* ...but Fortnite ruined the fun and so Root's relationship got broken into pieces... Pieces that are impossible to fix... And so root is alone in this cruel world...

Are you guys happy? Happy about what happened to Root? 

He was having hard time dealing with this world and you people just ruined him.

Toxicity is what ruin everyone...its why Root is having hard time getting his friends back...TOXICITY IS THE REASON THERE ARE NEWS ABOUT PEOPLE CANT EVEN CONTINUE LIFE AND SO THEY DIE IMMEDIATELY OR GO INTO MENTAL BREAKDOWN...

He is in hospital getting therapy...he can't move his leg nor his hands...he is exhausted because no one is helping him...its more than enough to see his mother die from a car accident by a reckless toxic punk who thinks he is superior and he is always right to do it...and got away from it.

468,1machi,1539436346,9ntngn,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ntngn/question_about_240hz_monitor/,1,Question about 240hz monitor.," I duno much about refresh rate and fps, so this is all new to me. Recently bought a 240hz monitor

\- Me, who has 6700k + 1080ti computer. I play on 240hz monitor and my fps range from 100-240fps in-game.

\- My friend who has way worse computer than I do. He plays on 60hz monitor with around 100 fps in-game.

Whenever my fps drop below 180 I start to feel some kind of lag. In tilted tower or in 50vs50 team fights my fps drop to as low as 100-120. It is barely playable. I feel so much lag that I can't aim right anymore. Whenever me and my friend get into big fights in tilted tower, I keep telling him I'm lagging. But he is always confused and told me how is that possible because my computer is better than his.

Is it because I got too used to 240hz and whenever my fps drop or fluctuate my refresh rate is going all over the place? So basically I'm playing at 100hz at one point then jump to 140hz at one point then back to 240hz when no team fights? While my friend on the other hand is constantly playing at 60hz and he got used to it? What should I do here? Spent thousands on a new pc? New i9-9900k and 2080ti? I highly doubt this upgrade can keep my fps above 240hz at all time in Fortnite. I just don't think it is possible in tilted or large team fight. ",FortNiteBR

The game is no longer that new and innovative (building was the main innovation anyway) and it just seems like Epic is pumping out more and more skins and the game isn’t evolving very much.

Basically Fortnite is like it’s own skin of a cash grab card collecting type game and we all fell for it. 

It has the basic gameplay of a fun shooter, but the focus is on collecting skins and emotes to flaunt to other players.

Now 10 year old kids think it’s ok to spend $20/week on in game skins they use for a few days and then never look at again when the new one comes out.

Feels like it’s fucking up young people’s expectations and perspective on value of money and what video game companies should be offering for 10,20,40,60 dollars.

I haven’t bought the new battlepass personally cause I just don’t see the point in all the challenges anymore. But that’s just me as a 30 yr old who played this game since inception and also played Paragon for 1000+ hours. Fortnite just doesn’t offer the gameplay depth to keep me interested now.

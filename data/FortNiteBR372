I think they are correct. Think about it: the theme of this season is space right? Astronauts, the rustlord (starlord) skin, all this stuff. 

What if this wormhole would lead to a new map? Seeing that the Epic company has expanded so much since the success of Fortnite, they totally could have made a map by now. This wormhole, I believe, will be the gateway to this new map. Dont get me wrong: I still think something will happen to Tilted. But this 4th season definitely could unveil an entirely new map. 

Its all just a theory though.",FortNiteBR

If you are chat partying up with friends, Q'ing up at the same time as friends, attempting to get into the same game, and meeting up, THAT should be considered cheating (and currently is).

If you are in a match by yourself and you run into a random person, and for whatever reason you decide to not kill each other (dances/emotes/sharing guns or shield) and then team up afterwards, I genuinely do not think this should be considered cheating.

My reasoning:

1.) This is natural strategy in a BR style scenario. People form temporary alliances. This is a trope within the genre, and a natural development you should expect in a game of this style.

2.) Anyone could potentially team up in this manner. Attempting to form an alliance like this is a risk. You're just as likely to get one-pumped in the head as you are to make a (temporary) friend.

3.) ""Team"" killing is on in this situation. If the members of this temporary alliance are not careful, they could end up doing more to harm than help their partner.
      3a.) Entering an alliance like this severely limits your ability to safely use traps, grenades, and explosives. Especially if you are sharing a base.

4.) In the end, these people still have to kill each other. Betrayal might not come in the top 5, you must expect it as a possibility at any moment.

Now I understand that the main flaw in my suggestion is that Epic has no way of telling if these teams are Rando's who met in-match, or friends who exploited the game to end up in the same solo. 

I don't expect them to change the rules at any point, because I have no idea how they'd be able to solve that issue, but I felt it would be a good discussion to have within the community.

Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

I’m not sure if Epic is planning on increasing the amount of materials you get from farming soon, but as it currently stands I already spend a boring amount of time in each match farming materials. 

Adding in vending machines which require materials in exchange for items, is surely just going to increase the amount of time each person spends farming. 

More farming and less fighting makes this game more boring (as shown by the fact that Blitz was the most fun many of us have had playing the game). ",FortNiteBR

Firstly add a 10-20 second gap between available uses. The worst part of the guides missile is that you can fire it over and over again with a very short time period in between shots.

Secondly make it a 1 shot kill (give it 1 health) it is insanely hard to shoot down especially on console so 1 health seems fair to me

Thirdly give it a shorter range. I feel like it's lifetime is not enough it needs to cut out after a certain DISTANCE not TIME.

They also frequently bring up the topic of giving skins out based on the number of wins a player racks up. For example; if a player gets 100 wins in any game mode the get a new skin. It is ideas like this that make me upset and that have been plaguing the video gaming community for a while. Rewarding the players that have no life while punishing us casually players for not spending more time on the game. I want a system the doesn't praise people for time committed, but rather for skill, which is why I am suggesting the idea for a legendary skin skill based reward system. I would like to see Epic games spend a little time and develop a truly mesmerizing original skin. A skin that would make even the skull trooper scared. And then I want them to put it in the game as a reward for any player that gets 25+ kills in a single game of any mode. This idea would cater to both casual and hardcore players, while still encouraging people to grind out games in hopes of acquiring what would be an incredibly elusive and rare skin. Unlike the battle pass (John Wick skin specifically) this reward would be a status symbol as there would only be one incredibly difficult path to unlocking it. Only the top percent of players would have this, and those who didn't would be driven to get their. Please support this thread if you want to see this happen in Fortnite!",FortNiteBR

77,SalvationInDreams,1522772373,89fi2u,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/89fi2u/mobile_was_released_nearly_four_weeks_ago_time/,8,Mobile was released nearly four weeks ago. Time for some feedback on the platform.,"I see a lot of threads or comments about the mobile platform unnecessarily pushed aside. However, now that we have the full release available to anyone on iOS, I think there are a lot of aspects that need to be discussed, most especially issues that were present on release and persist to this day. For the record, I’m playing on an 8+.   

- First, yes, mobile is fun. It sucks to control it at first but it gets better as you get used to it. It’s awesome to have this game on the go. However...   
- Playing on mobile makes you worse at the real game. It teaches you the wrong lessons about approaching engagements, firefights, etcetera. It’s almost a different game. I have my share of wins on both mobile and PC, but I always need a couple of games to get back in the groove when I switch platforms. This is perhaps to be expected, but it isn’t just a question of controls - it’s how those controls impact playing the game.   
- Building is relatively meaningless under pressure. Outside of transportation, cover from distance shots, or 1x1s in the final circle, it might as well not be in the game. This is slight hyperbole but still - engagements won with building are very different and are usually because the other participant is fighting their controls rather than you.   
- The gun meta is totally different due to the aim assist. It is necessary but it makes SMGs very very good, as the fire rate plus lock-on make me them quite powerful - even the grey ones. It also means that shotguns are good only in a fairly specific range due to fire rate and the inconsistentcy of aim assist. Still, it’s not really great to have someone jumping with an SMG that can’t miss, that can’t be hit, and you die. Been on both sides of it. I’ll take it but it’s not really fun. 
- The controls result in too many random fights, were the winner has 5hp and the loser just barely dies. It’s unsatisfying no matter what side you’re on.   
- As I said, aim assist is quite unreliable many times, pulling things (most often) wide right. This results in hilariously bad shotgun duels where two people could basically look at one another point blank, empty the barrel, and miss constantly. This is merely one example of the problems. If you disable the assist you’re at a meaningful disadvantage but enabling it means you’re fighting it half the time. This needs a look.  
- Controls are most definitely a work in progress. Sometimes you’ll switch to build in the middle of a fight. Sometimes turbo build fails and you just fall. Sometimes the left joystick won’t register at all off of the jump. It’s glitchy and problematic.  
- Sometimes when you go to shoot someone you can accidentally replace your active weapon with a weapon that was on the ground. This is completely unacceptable and can wreck you mid-engagement. This has persisted despite some of the improvements they made a week or two ago.  
- Stats for the mobile platform. When? And will they be backdated? I selfishly want credit for my hard-earned wins!  

I’m very glad we have this platform, but I really want to see it improve.

When they first came out they were honestly so dope, unique; locked behind an entire road of challenges in the Battle Pass. But literally the day the skins dropped the value of them immediately dropped. Literally everybody has them. I feel as though those skins should hold value to them, where if you see them in the lobby you just look in awe. Now it means nothing if you have a skin like that. My pitch is that you lock exclusive skins behind achievements/playtime/season level/prestige, I'm not asking you to not get rid of the fact that you can buy out the entire pass. That's your hustle and your grind. It's an easy 150 dollars that way. I just don't want to see John Wicks or Black Knights hiding in bushes.

This isn't pubg where everyone goes prone in the grass as soon as the 4th circle hits, you build, you fight, and you counter. It's easy just learn how to do it. And people saying that the missile is too common, it's a legendary, no it's not, you can't even find one laying around like you can with scars and silenced pistols, I've been searching for one since it came out and I still haven't gotten one from the supply drops, the only time I obtained is when I killed another guy who had one.

Stop saying everything is OP, they are not, the same was said with every single new gun and weapon epic added into the game, just stop! Learn to gain experience, that's the only way to win the game.

One idea would be if you fire the guided missile, you become visible on the map, basically like a radar and your spot is revealed as a red dot, so its risk reward, you make yourself vulnerable as you show up on the map, but again its fair in terms of you can still guide and kill someone.

The only other thing i could think of is the timer is toned down, i dont know how many seconds you get to use the rocket but maybe halving the time you can use it maybe?

Week 7 (this week-starts Thursday), levels 60-70,  include the dark voyager which insinuates we need to go to deep space or something is coming from deep space- I’m not crazy the description is “from the vast darkness of deep space.” And telescopes show up.

Week 8, next week, levels 70-80,  the meteor strike is imminent and we have to pass some sort of test- the IQ 200 and pickaxe describes as “ready to pass the test”

Me when I unlocked Black Knight: KNIGHT THEME IS MY FAVORITE AND IM THE MOST BADASS KNIGHT OF THE SET, NO NEED FOR THE SHOP EVER AGAIN I WILL SAVE MY MONEY GG

After a few days when quite literally everybody is running around in the new insanely cool skin (and after dying to it a bunch of times as well), it kind of gets....well....uncool. Then we wait for the newest one to ""refresh the cycle""

- A new and amazing skin is datamined or pops up in the shop
- Repeat cycle and claim this is THE skin
- Switch skin after a bit 

The Raven will suffer from this the most, which is why I had this idea and think exclusive achievement based skins should be put into the game. 
 
***Disclaimer:*** *I am not bashing new and great looking skins and the sale of them, Epic is doing this very well. The build up, the hype, and the fact that it cost a large chunk of change to ensure that lots are sold but there are still some that cannot purchase every amazing legendary skin.* 

The point of this discussion is to address the routine pattern of the newest and greatest skins and why there should be exclusive skins that are acquired through achievements. I will get to some of the ideas of the achievements as I feel it should be fair to everybody. 

**I feel like exclusive achievement based skills can go one of two ways** 

- Complete the achievement (easy/medium/hard/insane) and unlock said exclusive skin* Less cool skins can be unlocked with the easier achievements, etc.

- Complete the achievement (easy/medium/hard/insane) and gain access to the exclusive skin store with the right to buy certain skins based on the amount of achievements completed*

**Achievements can range from anything like:**

- Win 1,000 Solo Matches (Unlocks super insanely cool skin like a spin off of Kratos from God of War idk)
- Get 50 Pickaxe kills (medium tier cool skin like a guy dressed in a sport uniform or something) 

If I see someone else rocking the god of war skin - I can admire the fact that someone else won 1,000 solo games and it is STILL cool that we both have it. Not load up the pregame lobby and seeing tons of battle hounds, Wukongs, and John Wicks even. 

I'd love to hear what anyone else thinks

**EDIT: Credit to user /u/Krunklock for his additional idea on this**

""They can make take the same skin and give it a bit more color, or a few additional accents for achievement based rewards. Like, just take the bunny skin...everyone can just buy that, and it's all over now. But if you win 100 games, you get the bunny skin but either a different color, or with a better looking mask. That way, people that can't play enough to win 100 matches in a week, can still get cool skins, but reward players that grind or have a higher skill level.""

Also while ""winning"" they are ruining fortnite for the rest of us. I dont know about you guys, but my friends dont play fortnite, so I am forced to play by myself. So guess what. I stumble upon these people, lose and then get angry because of them. So why should their immaturity destroy my game play? For fuck's sake.

Don't get me wrong, this weapon is not OP. Everyone knows it can be countered and dealt with. The problem is, this weapon is an anomaly of the game and does not represent the core principles of fortnite thus far. This weapon promotes opportunistic camping in players rather than skilled gameplay. 

This hasn't been a problem with any other gun in fortnite, but this weapon feels cheap to use. I don't like getting kills with it because I know that I didn't actually ""beat"" my opponent. And getting killed by it is the most annoying thing because I'm always in a gunfight with another team. Long distance interference between quality team fights will always hurt the game, and Snipers are hard enough to land on moving targets that their impact to team fights from a long distance requires combat skill. These rockets can heavily change every game without any combat skill.

   I've played Fortnite for months now, and in that time, I've only relished upon ONE win. One, very cheap, victory royale. And I get stressed out. I mean, one should when they drop in anarchy acres and then they immediately get sprayed down by some Dark Voyager or whatever.

I was just near quitting entirely, until the V2 Sniper Shootout was announced. I'm not the hottest trigger in the West, but when it comes to snipers, I bask in that glory of getting a headshot from 100 metres away, and watching my foe burst like a firework. In Fortnite, snipers are God.

 I played my first few matches of the limited time event, and I said to myself, ""Wow. This feels different. Better. FAIR."" Because in Shootout, no one can get the drop on you. Everyone is off target. Everyone ""sucks"". And that makes firefights, and the whole of Fortnite in general, a LOT more interesting.

So I propose to the Reddit community, and Epic Games itself, that game modes such as sniper shootout are made permanent, so that low-class noobs like myself can still cherish that warming and humbling feeling of playing a game of Fortnite Battle Royale.

Slurp Juice gives 25 shields, 25 HP during 25 seconds (1 per second) and this makes it unuseful during gun fights. Have mini shields? Good! You can get 50 shields within 4 seconds. With Slurp, you get 4 HP and 4 Shield. 

Okay, so my point above proves Mini Shields are more useful in gun fight. What about other situations? Beginning of the games its the worst healing based item (Behind Bandages and Med Kits), because it gives you only 25 shields. 

You can only carry 2 Slurps (50HP/50Shd). Pretty poor compared you can carry 10 Minishields (250 Shields), 3 Med Kits (300 HP), Chug (100HP/100Shld) or Two big Shields (100 Shields).

After reading that part you might think that Slurp is equally good as Big Shields. Well no. You can only use ONE Slurp at the time, so you have to wait 25 seconds to get 25 HP and 25 Shield. After that, you drink another one. So you have to wait 50 SECONDS to have full effect to Slurp. That is pretty absurd compared that you only have to use 15 seconds to get full effect of Chug. Actually, you can build 1x1 base, drink THREE Chugs within the same time it tooks you to get full effect of Slurp.

Pretty awful return for Epic healing item. 

How to fix Slurp? I have few suggestions.

A) Make it Rare healing item, found in stash of 2 and you can carry up to 5. Keeps current effects.

B) Make it Uncommon healing item, found in stash of 1 and carry caps at 2, keep the current effects.

C) Keep it Epic, found in stash of 1, but you can carry 3. Have effects right away.",FortNiteBR

You're probably all sick of these stupid text posts making theories about the comet and what it will do, but hear me out for a moment. I did a bit of thinking, and in my own opinion, **I believe the meteor is going to lead to the introduction of a new POI**. While there is no substantial evidence within the comet-related content to lead to this idea, this theory is based mainly upon an example of a similar situation that happened in game. What situation was this, you ask? *The lead-up and introduction of Lucky Landing*.

Let's look at how Lucky Landing was introduced:

* The first sign of Lucky Landing was the introduction of Shrines in version 2.5.0, released on the 13^th of February ([Patch notes as evidence](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v2-5-0-patch-notes)).

* These were small, sparse buildings with a Chinese theme to them. The two important things to notice here was the inclusion of 2-3 chests per location, and the total amount of shrines only amassing to ~7.

* 15 days after the inclusion of these shrines came update 3.1.0, notable for *the introduction of the new POI Lucky Landing* ([Again, Patch notes as evidence](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v3-1-0-patch-notes)).

You may think I'm just rambling off by this point, so let me get to the point. Let's review what we've seen about the comet:

* With the comet, came the introduction of various campsites located around the island. While it's true that they were not officially mentioned in the patch notes for the update they came with ([Version 3.4.0 specifically](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v3-4-patch-notes)), there could've been a possible nod to them with the line:
&gt; Hop around, you'll be sure to find lots of Easter Eggs…

* The campsites *are small and sparsely spread around*, there are at least *7 different locations* where they can be found, and each one *can have up to 2-3 chests*.

* *It has been less than 15 days since update 3.4.0.*

With these facts, it's pretty prominent that **the campsites are just another iteration of the shrines**.

Now with the *what* out of the way, let's talk about the *when*.

Version 3.4.0 was released on the 28^th of March, and it is currently the 4^th of April, meaning there has been just about 6 days since the introduction of the comet. If the campsites follow the method of the shrines with great detail, the new POI should be released in around 9 days, or about the 13^th. 

As for the *where*, I'm not entirely certain as to where this POI could be. So again, I looked to the shrines. [This is a map showcasing all the locations of the shrines](https://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/e_sharpen:100/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto/v1/gameskinnyc/m/a/p/mapcov-c7b37.jpg). We know that Lucky Landing was in the end situated at the shrine at F10. The only thing that stands out to me at this locations is that it's devoid of any kind of POI, therefore being a healthy spot for it. If we use this kind of thinking on the campsites, we could make an educated guess as to where this POI could be. [This is a map of at least 7 locations of campsites](https://i.imgur.com/S14o1D4.jpg) (Sorry for the poor resolution). We know that Lucky Landing was decided to be placed in the *general area* of one of the shrines, and where there was space for a new POI. Let's go over each location in detail to see whether it fits these guidelines:

* D3 is, as it stands, too close to Pleasant Park, and moving it anywhere else nearby would make it squished between several unmarked locations. An unlikely location.

* H3, as it stands, is a bit too close to Wailing Woods. However, moving it north into the dry area would give it some breathing room. A possible location.

* B5, as it stands, is a bit too close to Snobby Shores, and moving it nearby would be difficult with the sports center and Pleasant Park. An unlikely location.

* F5, as it stands, could possibly fit in its location. But seeing as there's a big open field south of it, I would see it going in there. A possibly location.

* F8 Has a fair amount of promise. The mountain it stands on has plenty of breathing room for a POI, while also having a little bit of extra room in the South-West. At this point in time, it's a likely location, and the one I'm placing my money on.

* H8, as it stands, seems a bit too close to both Moisty Mire and the prison, but a relocation Southwards could see it fitting in. A possible location.

* I7, as it stands, is a somewhat promising locations, with lots of space for a new POI. The only problem would be the removal of the race track (or 'Gus' as it is know as). A somewhat possible location.

These are only 7 locations, mind you. If anyone else has found another campsite, please be sure to inform me about it so I can add it to the list and map. This has been a long post, so let me wrap up the final section quickly: Context of the POI. What is it going to be exactly?

If the campsites are any indication, this new POI will either be a large campsite with telescopes, or, and in my personal opinion being more likely, an observatory.

Well that's it. Please give me some feedback on how this all sounds, or possibly some new information. If you managed to make it all the way through, thank you.

**Tl;dr** I believe in a bit over a week from now, a new POI will be introduced, located somewhere around F7 to F8, being something related either to a campsite or observatory.

**Edit:** I completely forgot about the location at I7, my bad. Adding it in now",FortNiteBR

[Here is a video](https://streamable.com/xjpl3) of my last few games from tonight, all embarrassing gunfight failures.

I've been playing for almost a month now. I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 games under my belt but ZERO KILLS. I'm getting better at building and various other elements of the game, but everything falls apart when I get in a gunfight. 

I have difficulty switching between weapons and between build/weapon mode. These are things I'm working on. But this post is specifically about aiming.

I see others play, kills and aiming just look so effortless. As you can see in my video, it's rare that any of my shots actually hit their target. It just seems impossible to get the reticle to line up with the enemy. In the last game in the video specifically, I unload on the guy with two different guns and I don't even hit him once.

This happens again and again, and it's really demoralizing. It's not that I'm looking to win the whole match, just to win a gunfight every so often. Friends that I've roped into the game have surpassed me in skill and I'm considering quitting because losing every time I encounter another player is just not fun anymore.

I'm not making excuses, these are my failures and my fault. I just want to be better. If anyone can offer any suggestions based on what you see in my video, I'm all ears. 

I'm on PC with a keyboard+mouse.

Epic, if you're reading this, please add some sort of a practice or sandbox/bot mode. It's sorely needed.",FortNiteBR

Just curious to see what kind of computers you guys have and how they run the game. I'm looking into purchasing a pre-built computer (i know, i know.... margins have come down a lot) that will be used for school (CAD, engineering) as well as gaming! 

What kind of computer do you play on and how does it run fortnite? Do you think you'd ever try and upgrade due to poor FPS/performance?

PC I'm looking at (I'm sure it will run it great, but bouncing between spending another ~~$200 just incase it makes a difference):

My reasoning is that hats affect gameplay too much:

- Your eye gets used to simple player models (male and female, cosmeticless) and when the new hats get introduced every other day, your snap aiming gets wrecked (well, not wrecked, but you definitely start aiming slower) so this affects gameplay

- Different player model color schemes may be perceived differently on various map backgrounds. Spacesuit against the sky is harder to notice than the usual model (if not on its own, then mixed with some bush). The variation of this is a previous post about

And I landed right next to the warehouse because someone else was heading towards it. Then I grabbed a gun and went straight to this guy to kill him but he already went outside of the warehouse and was just building towers out of wood (I thought he got all the wood from the pallets in the warehouse,there are quite a lot).  
Anyways after I kept trying to kill him he continued to build himself up with bricks and metal. I was like ""When did he get all those materials?""   
After I finally managed to kill him by chopping down his towers and letting him die by fall damage (LUL btw) I collected his loot obviously and I got like 800 from every material.  
  
So is that possible ? Hacking materials ? Was this reported already ?

I have dealt with this weapon almost every game I get to top 6-9 and when I see it I think ""ahh that's cute"".

1) To use it you have to be completely stationary.

2) It's loud like no other, you can tell where it's coming from, from a mile away.

3) It's really slow, so it's not like you have 0.0000009 seconds to react.

4) So many ways to counter it:
    A.- Shoot it down, not hard, just three shots.
    B.- Wait a little and when it's really close so that it      can't maneuver away build a wall in front, and just like that the missile no longer exists as it collided with the wall and exploded.
    C.- Push the guy. He is not moving and if he stops controlling the rocket you will notice. 

So stop complaining about this gun. This are all disadvantage and the advantages it provides is just the ability to steer the rocket, a slow easy to kill or block rocket. 
Matter fact, I think the only people than complain about this is the people that have been killed by it, I'm not saying I will never get killed by one I know that will happen but it does not make it op just because you can control it.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I encounter teaming in solos almost daily, and have done for about 2 months now. I am on XBOX, Oceania servers.

Despite reporting every teamer when I can see their gamertag, it's clear nothing is done about them. Some users which I've reported have dozens of clips uploaded to Xbox Live with even more evidence of repeated teaming, and there are still clips uploaded over a month since I first reported them.

Every time I report I just get the same template response from Epic;

&gt;Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.

&gt;We understand that this issue is important to our players, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

&gt;Out of a respect for player privacy, we cannot share the details of any action we may take as a result of your report with anyone but the party or parties directly affected, but we thank you for your vigilance in helping us create the most friendly play environment possible!

Honestly, it feels like no action is being taken against teamers by Epic. Have they made any statement about the issue, besides the spiel in their FAQ - which is clearly not working;

&gt;**How do you handle teamers in solo play?**

&gt;We’ve built a system to automatically ban teamers in solo play.

&gt;If you ever encounter a player teaming be sure to also report them using the in-game feature. To find this you need to navigate to the settings menu and then click the “Feedback” button. You will then be given an option to report a player.

Lately, I've seen teamers in Black Knights skins, John Wick, and today the new Easter Bunny skins. The least Epic could do is permaban these accounts so there's some form of punishment, and then IP ban people who continue to make alt-accounts to team.

I get there's people who claim to have never seen teaming, and others who don't think it's a big deal, but all I can speak from is first-hand experience and frankly it's just annoying at this stage.",FortNiteBR

* 2. Enjoy!
* /s Fortnite wouldn't want to just remove the weapon entirely - so I have found out how to **Balance** the weapon.

We can balance the weapon by first getting rid of the ability to control the missile and replacing it with an ""auto home"" ability basically shortest distance between missile and person once it ""sees"" a person. If it doesn't see anybody it will continue in a straight line until someone is spotted. 

Reasons for this change:

* fixes scouting (which is soooo broken)
* fixes people getting killed while firing a guided missile. 
* makes guided missiles more predictable
* makes guided missiles more ""stupid"" (straight line algorithm)
* prevents self/team casualties (as stupid as *that* sounds)

Also with this fix they should make guided missile launchers more common and prevent users from spamming it (only able to launch after first one runs out). I understand that with this balance we would get less Ninja lv plays but I think it is a better alternative in the long run. Thx and have a nice day.

(PS4),"I've been coming across a bug that is making fortnite close to unplayable in some situations. I'm unsure if anyone else has had issues with this but its only started within the past 2-3 days for me. 

The issue occurs when switching from building mode back to a weapon (pressing Triangle), my characters weapon or pickaxe will be stuck in the air and I will be stuck with the building notebook thingy in my hand, unable to do anything. Sometimes its worse than others, some situations it will stay stuck and require me to press Circle and Triangle a couple of times to fix. Others its easier. 

This is not a major issue when just roaming around and bashing tree's, but when your in the middle of a gunfight where every second counts and your player is stuck without a weapon it can be very costly. As I have found out after dying multiple times due to this bug. 

I'm not sure whats going on right now, but the game is just general buggy and not working smoothly. It's quite frustrating but I'll just have to suck it up and keep dying #2 due to this bug, until Epic gets round to sorting it out. They're doing so well right now so I'm sure this will be a thing of the past very soon!

However there are a plethora of problems that, instead of slowing down and fixing, EPIC covers up with more STUFF. I emphasize that word because it’s the issue! Fortnite has too much stuff and it is overwhelming and ruining the fun a lot of the time for me. Day in and day out I’m worrying about 2 overpowered rocket launchers, grenade launchers, multiple different sniper rifles, overpowered and buggy shotguns, grenades of all different kinds with some effects that are un-counterable, and then match it with a base shooting mechanic that still feels unfinished and uncontrollable. I don’t even want to mention the unbelievable amount of skins epic tries to distract us with, I’m more ok with that tho because it hopefully helps fund development for fixing some of the problems. 

This games could be popular for years and be amazing but if Epic keeps adding stuff to distract us from the problems in the base game then I’m not gonna support it any longer. I don’t want to see more guns and crappy needless stuff. I want to see refinement and polish, 2 things this game is lacking more and more every day. There are no company’s that do anything without a call to action so every voice matters and I wanted to get mine out there. Thank you for reading. ",FortNiteBR

Once you learn the ability to call out where players are at in a quick, descriptive way that your teammates can translate into enemy locations can be a key decider in the reaction time the rest of your team can have that can ultimantely save your life. 

So is there or are there any tips in this game to help figure out what to call certain things?

So far, me and my friends have came up with a few ""unique names"" for some locations on the map.

* Death Mountain (The mountain north-west of Fatal Fields, with the house and basketball area, due to some bad experiences we have had there)

* Flat Top Mountain (The mountain right outside of tilted that has chests all along it)

---

But how do you help distinguish more CQB areas in towns and also in more open areas? Salty isn't bad because each building has a unique design (red brick, shanty house/treehouse, blue house, small house) but what about the other towns and factory areas? *Examples; Tilted, Flush Factory, Factory Near Flush, Factory Near Salty, Snobby, Retail Row, Pleasant, etc*

I know we struggle with callouts in Plesant Park, because there are two blue houses beside each other, and other houses that are very similar, tilted towers, and open areas of the map where there are just hills and open land?

---

**TLDR;** Are there any tips on how to call out and more effectively communicate which buildings enemies are on, which level they are on, direction, distance, etc? What do you prioritize saying first and what do you typically say last in your callouts? We are just trying to improve our communication so any tips would be appreciated from anyone in the community that has any.",FortNiteBR

In the writing below I will express my thoughts on some of Fortnite's mechanics.

1. -How shields are broken as of now
 Right now shields are not that common and are pretty much essential (unless you spend your time sitting in a bush, cough cough) and are hard to come by endgame, and it's pretty much DEVASTATING if you don't have any backup health by the end of the match, and what really makes me salty is that you basically have to kill the person twice if they have max shield and you're down to a measly 75 health, giving your opponent a large advantage at killing you.

-How they can be fixed
Shields should be more  common and easy to find. Also, to make it more balanced, shields should only go up 175 (not sure if that is valid right now though.)

2 - How RNG is a bad element of the game
- You drop in at greasy grove, oh look! It's a SMG, why not pick it up? It's weak but useable. Oh no, some guy with a better SMG has spotted me, and he is just as nearly as skilled as me, but unfortunately I cannot outplay and he kills me. Right now guns and accuracy are based on luck. You need better guns than someone pushing you with a gold rocket launcher. Basically, 1 on 1 fights are usually depicted on who had the better luck with recourses and guns. (Oh, and, don't forget about the shitty accuracy implanted in this game that is COMPLETELY random when it comes to close range.) Part of this game is RNG, and think should be fixed somehow.

- How it could be fixed 
Every certain amount of players, players should be given a gun of rarity that they already don't have to balance the RNG in this game. Also, just please, for the love of god, make accuracy skill based (AHEM AHEM *rocket launcher* AHEM AHEM) instead of being random or downright  stupidy accurate.

They back this theory up with the fact that the fortnite map looks like Poland and that a meteor hit a city in Poland which is in a similar place to where tilted towers is now and this is what is also going to happen in fortnite.

To make this clear, I am not saying that the map isn’t based off of Poland. However, when tilted was originally put in the map, the developers wouldn’t have known that it would have ruined the gameplay so they wouldn’t have put tilted in the same place as a city that got hit by a meteorite deliberately ( sorry I don’t know the city’s name) unless they planned to blow tilted up all along. This means that tilted was probably just put there randomly and not based off of a particular polish city which makes me believe that the theory that tilted will be hit like the polish city was probably isn’t true.

There are other theories out there that say that the meteor will hit tilted but I just saw a flaw in this one and thought it was worth mentioning. Please tell me if I missed anything :).",FortNiteBR

3. Add the game to steam so I can count my hours.

4. Some more stats and some way of implementing a skill based  rank without ruining the base game e.g your ratio of kills to revives/ survival rate over a week or season.

Basically, ended with him endlessly shooting missiles and AR-spamming me until I inevitably lost.

I'm not saying this to whine or complain *I am a little salty about the loss though :(*. The weapon isn't perfectly balanced. Maybe have it only be able to shoot 2-3 rockets per pickup?

Duels.,"So I doubt this will get much attention but this is something I've been thinking about for a while now and would love to see put in the game at some point. I have been playing games competitively since Cod4 on gamebattles doing tournaments and running ladders so I always love competitive aspects of games. I'm not sure if it has been suggested but here it goes. 

Solo/duo duels. Possibly Squad duels as well. One of my favorite parts of this amazing game is the rare build fights that I get into. A good build battle gets my heart racing more than being the last two in games now a days. A duel will allow players to just focus on each other which will almost always end up as a build fight because that's how you win most 1v1 fights against competent players in solos. With a game mode like this it would allow higher tier players to get better at build fights while letting lower tier players get a taste of what it takes to win more battles in royale. This mode would be quick and incredibly fun while raising the overall skill of the fortnite population.

Some points I thought of for the duels.

-The map that could be used is the spawn island or even a portion of it as it's big enough to allow anything to happen and small enough so your not running forever.

-Players can start with a decent amount of materials. Possibly 500 of each material. So not much time is spent mining.

-Random guns spawn next to the character spawn so you're somewhat ready from the start. Guaranteed AR and Shotguns in those spawns which are a necessity for all fights.

-No Grenade/Rocket Launchers. Or very limited ammo for them if they are present. (It's too easy to win fights with rocket/grenade spams)

-Boogie bombs/Impulses/Grenades allowed.



This is just some things I thought of that I think would work for the duels but ofcourse everything is just a suggestion. Sorry if this is poorly written but I'm doing it while in class lol. I'm sure there are better ways to lay it out but y'all get the idea. Let me know what you think :)",FortNiteBR

The vibrations while parachuting onto the island say “SOS D5 418”. SoS and D5 as we know means help at Tilted Towers, located at the D5 square on the map. 

418 has been said my some to by April 1st, 2018, which does not make much sense. But it clearly says 4/18- April 18th. With this we can presume the destruction of or something big will be happening on April 18th, at square D5: Tilted Towers.  ",FortNiteBR

After switching weapons there is a potential for it to just freeze in the air at the start of the take out animation. The weapon is then unusable until you switch to another weapon and switch back.

This bug is starting to get out of hand, it doesn't only apply to weapons but building as well, I wasn't able to get the screenshot of my pen and paper freezing in the air and me being unable to build as I died very shortly after experiencing it, but I have screenshots of my axe and revolver freezing.

Frozen pick: https://gyazo.com/9b4b82dcd74e92602aadd521384bcdc2

I could get a billion more screenshots if I wanted since spam weapon switching for a few seconds will end up freezing one of your weapons at some point. Epic Games, fix this, its game breaking and I've lost plenty fights due to this.",FortNiteBR

I have such a hard time breaking the wall and killing the person inside.  They can build a wall/ceiling faster than you can shoot them and you are making so much noise, someone usually comes to intervene.  Thoughts?  Are there any strategy videos on this?

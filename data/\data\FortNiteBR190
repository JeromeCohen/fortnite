Gone are the times of most players in a lobby being terrible players that can't build. Nowadays most fights, particularly in solos, are a hard fought fight meaning it won't end quickly. This means there is more time for other players to come in and third party you. On top of this, a better average playerbase means more aggressive players. With more people backing their own skills, more people will be willing to push towards gun shots and building then in the past. This results in multiple people pushing towards you while you are in a fight causing third fourth and fifth parties. 
Tldr; if you aren't enjoying fortnite as much this season, it's because the average player is better then in the past. ",FortNiteBR

In his games room we have a PC , an Xbox, 2 switches and a PS4 and often have squad games where his friends will log in to their accounts on one of our systems.

Over an average week there may be 5-10 different accounts all playing using the same WiFi connection.

No one uses any cheats or hacks and I’m just wondering if epic will think it’s odd so many different accounts are being used from the same WiFi network and if there’s anything wrong in doing so.

Obviously none of his friends want to get banned for any reason and I’ve seen reports here of accounts getting banned for apparently unknown reasons.

I myself have a switch account and an Xbox account and a PS4 account with different skins on each so play with different accounts regularly .

The damage from traps and the increase of droprate is so fcking stupid why would you want to step the trap game up it takes no skill. 70% of my battles i lose against traps during a build fight everyone just use traps as their defense weapon because they (always) have one.

Degrade the droprate and the damage, because it takes no skill to use it everyone i fight when i get them low hp they use a trap to box me in. And do not tell me that it is my fault, some sitautions you cannot avoid getting boxed and that is where your enemy just puts a trap and then dead. Not fun

The Crazy Castle spray hinted at the haunted castle at Haunted Hills. The Sushi spray hinted at the Sushi Master skin. The Strawberry Paws spray hinted at the Hime skin with her back bling, Shiro (cat with a bow with paws in a similar position). Good vibes spray hinted at the Hippie skins. Laser Chomp spray hinted at the Laser Chomp glider. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at the sprays in Season 6 and which ones are hinting at something. Meow Moon spray could be hinting at cat cosplay skins (well for women, dressing up as a cat is very popular for Halloween parties). Manhole cover: if you look at the image in the centre, it looks like a new location so possible new location in coming or addition to an existing location. Llama De Muertos (Llama of the Dead) to me is hinting at a Llama themed skin that has to do with Mexican holiday, Day of the Dead so it would come out around 1st November to 2nd November (the actual holiday day) and so maybe Epic plan on doing a respectful short event for this holiday.. who knows. Also adding more I guess evidence is the Game Over spray that has a grave stone with a llama on it: dead llama + day of the dead llama. Finally the Oni spray is most certainly to me hinting at an Oni skin with that exact same mask.",FortNiteBR

The tank would shoot a rpg and deal huge amounts of damage to structures but the time to fire again would be 10 seconds. The tank would be randomly generated across the map, The tank is meant to destroy large bases, port a fortresses and port a forts. 

&amp;#x200B;

The plane would be a small war plane and it would have 4 seats 1 for the driver and the other 3 to shoot or dance the plane would have a limit as it only has 200 hp and a limited height range.

jumping off will result in the plane crashing and you will be able to re-deploy your gliders

* Only comes with the skull trooper

* No OG purple, edit styles are only green and blue

* Every kill, it glows brightly for .5 seconds

* At 4 kills it gets a trail of blue or green depending on the style you chose

* At 5 kills it gains ghost floating out of the portal

* 6+ kills it just gets brighter 

* The Backbling event ends at *October 14th, 11:59PM ET* (Less than 3 hours from the time of this post)

* The event is complete 20 matches by October 14th, 11:59PM ET and you receive the backbling by the 6.10 update later this week

* If you miss out on the event, you can still get the backbling via doing the normal challenges that come with it

* ""Wait, how do people already have it??"" - well if you had 3 daily challenges stacked up at the release of the challenges, you could have gotten the backbling by last night 

* Any questions, just comment below and I can answer!

I have created a shortcut that I have tested for a couple of days and should run fine (barring any abnormal posts from u/stormshieldonebot)

This shortcut allows you to check the current Item shop for Fortnite without opening Reddit and searching for u/stormshieldonebot’s latest post for the latest Item Shop.

#Requirements

This requires an iPhone, and iOS 12 to be installed, as well as the Shortcuts App to be [**downloaded off the App Store here.**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8) 

#UpdateKit

I recommend downloading UpdateKit as well, which enables the Shortcut to be updated if any issues arise, or if a more efficient method is found or if there is a need to add any more features to the shortcut. You can [**download UpdateKit from here.**](http://www.mikebeas.com/updatekit) 

UpdateKit was created by /u/MikeBeas and RoutineHub, where FortniteBR Item Shop Image is hosted for updates, was created by u/hmhrex

#Download Shortcut

You can [download the **FortniteBR Item Shop Image** Shortcut version 1.0 directly from here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6c51e0f1d51b48ffb640e55f84d471ad)

Additionally, you can [go to **RoutineHub** and always download the latest version here whenever it is updated.](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/250)

Special Thanks to u/MikeBeas for UpdateKit, u/hmhrex for RoutineHub and allowing the automatic update of Shortcuts to be possible, /u/SK4T3RG4M3R for the original Fortnite Item Shop Shortcut, enabling me to understand more of how to create Shortcuts and the use of RSS feeds and how to filter the results.

About a week ago (or two at this point) I logged into Battle Royale after doing playing Save The World and found that all my set cosmetics had been changed. Upon closer inspection I found that my Valkryie skin and backpack/wings  and The Dragon Glider that came with her where missing (about 40$ worth of cosmetic) and I have the Norse Glider, and the Norse boat  glider and skin for the Dark Glyph set (which I never bought/earned). Along with my trails list looking smaller but not to sure about that one. 

So I contacted Epic Games support and after a few messages back and forth they finally sent me this list of information (list provided below), I needed to provide  (which is ridiculous in my opinion for just account verification) and it's been almost 3-4 days since I provided this information and I have yet to get a response or get my items back.

•	Your public IP address(es) (IPv4), which you can find by searching ""What is my IP address"" in your internet browser; if you use multiple devices, please include all IP addresses
•	Date when you created your Epic Games account
•	An invoice ID for any Epic Games purchase you made on the account (the Invoice ID begins with an ""A,"" followed by 8 digits; example: A12345678)
•	Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account
•	Original display name for the account
•	Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account
•	Date of your last login
•	Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected


So I don't really know what to do at this point as I'm completely frustrated that I have lost my 40$ cosmetics and have no way of getting it refunded. So any help would be appricates.

Yes, some people would not like this. However, considering that the store items rotate so often, the items would not lose too much rarity.

It felt like an actual survival battle royale, and now, it’s absolute madness.

Back then I would’ve been lucky to get two kills, now I’m at least scoring ten a game (light flex) in a breeze. 

9/10 battles are build battles. (add melee weapons, please, i’m sick of people jumping around in 1x1 spaces, spamming with a shotgun, it’s claustrophobic). And the battles that I don’t get into build battles with, like if i encountered a true noob, it really takes me back how we would all crouch and walk around constantly through the match, having no idea how to build like the architectural god we are today.

I absolutely still love the game, but I really do miss the night time, the swirly clouds in the sky, and the pulsating storm clouds.

Of course, with a game like Fortnite, change is inevitable, but i feel like they really took away a lot of little details that made Fortnite BR very different than your typical BR game.

Also bring back the old school then music. I’m talking about the first song that would play in the first main loading screen, and then the second song that would come on when you selected “Battle Royale”.",FortNiteBR

By waiting thirty days, you can make sure you save your V-bucks for something even better that could be released or save yourself from using a refund because it turns out you really didn’t like the skin. When the skin comes back and if you still really want it, then you know it’s worth your money.

For those unaware, skins are on a cycle and always return 30-40 days after they were originally released. The only exceptions have been Season 1 skins and Powerchord. You don’t have to worry about your skin being gone forever (exception would be holiday skins such as 4th of July). Shoutout to u/CarlosTheCar. He can tell you roughly when a skin will return to shop. 

Edit: Also, this tip will save you from buying a skin that turns out to have a dumb bug such as the scuba skins or the powerchord armpit glitch.

Sometimes You can click on the highlights button, it bring up the UI and it wont let you click on anything. Very very infuriating when you hit a really nice shot or got some really nice kills in a game only to find out you cant even get them. Possible cause could be tabbing out of game for too long. Seems to not happen when i constantly have Fortnite in focus. 
Is anyone else having problems like this or is it just me? Very...very annoying.",FortNiteBR

Revives:

* it takes too long to revive someone
* multiple people reviving a teammate, should accelerate the revive procces
* if the revive is interrupted then the counter should not drop to zero but instead diminish slowly
* revive should grant XP just as kills do (Battlefield games)
* there should be a revive gun that accelerates the revive for teammates or a syringe that revive instantly but with single use
* when playing 20v20, just as I can revive anyone in the whole team I also want to notified if anyone is knocked down

HUD:

* I want to see the silhouettes of my squad mates at all times (u know as shadows thru walls)

Scoring:

* critical assists points when assisting a teammate to knock down an enemy, by dealing lots of dmg
* assist points when assisting a teammate to knock down an enemy, by some dmg
* points for donating items to other players in the team (especially medkits, bandages, shield potions, chugs)
* points for repairing allied structures
* points when reviving someone in the storm

Other:

* I what to be able to carry someone on my back, so I could carry downed allies away from the storm and into the circle (I of course being unable to fire any guns, use items or build stuff)

It‚Äôs a nightmare scenario as it gives away your position, wastes your time, and wastes your ammo. It ultimately makes the game come down to who is better at spamming walls (and has more resources) rather than who is better at aiming.

With a cool down on building implemented people are no longer able to spam walls as fast.

the idea i am talking about is a grenade like tool, which autoconstructs a base.
My idea focusses on two things:

1. The needed materials are not used from your inventory but from the grenade.

2. Console players (such as i am) are *normally* not as fast in building as pc players. This tool would help even not that good players to build extremely fast.

To the details:

In my imagination this grenade would probably build a tower with a base of 2by1. There would be stairs inside ( the ones that do a 180 so you can reach the top). After three stairs (so 3 blocks high) you would have a room with windows to the outside so you have cover but can also shoot. Maybe there is something like a balcony all around. Also a roof should be there to give you more cover.

At the bottom where the stairs begin should be one or even two traps to prevent enemies rushing in.

Technical Details:
The base snaps to the nearest floor under the ground and builds up from there. The entrace is facing the user for quick access. 

Could be found in three stages:

* rare --&gt; wood
* epic --&gt; stone
* legendary --&gt; metal

Our squad had pushed on, you were bringing up the rear, and suddenly I heard shots. 
We all rushed back to kill the enemy, and I looked through our group frantically, but I couldn't see you.... and there it was.

In a pile of loot... a gold grenade launcher.

I salvaged what I could from the ruins, to help bandage up the rest of our team, but there were no bandages to bring you back.  There was no taste to that chicken dinner.

It would be a nice break from Battle Royale mode, as great as it is, for a quick blast while you might be waiting for friends to finish a Battle Royale game. 

For example, all maps would be based on current points of interest, like an expanded Tilted Towers, Lucky Landing, Retail Row. Outside the boundaries of the map would be the storm that has zombies randomly spawning (inside only to keep you out). 

Weapons, mats, ammo, and heals have rotating spawn points, heals are pickups rather than inventory items that you have to consume.

Building would be limited in that it disintegrates after a certain amount of time to discourage camping, without harming defensive building/build offs. 

Your respawn is on a cool down that increases slightly each time you die, but can be reduced by being ""picked up."" 

This is just something I've been thinking about for a while, and would reinvigorate the team Deathmatch scene.

This game with two of the more recent patches have rendered it more and more unplayable. It's terribly sad as this is one of my favorite games ever (I'm not even that good XD). This post by ""u/Stef4Q"" has been very good for the community and encouraging for me to know that I am not the only one noticing the terrible state of this game. I encourage everyone to visit the thread I put in the comments. At one point, this sub would downvote anyone to oblivion for talking bad about the devs, and rightfully so! The way this game started out -- with great developer support, great patches, and wonderful communication to the community -- it is scary to realize that this has been on a steep decline early into the game's life.

What's more alarming is that Epic has not patched any of the known bugs. With every new addition to the game, five bugs come with it. Some well known bugs that have not been fixed include:

1. Building steps and walking through them

2. Severe lag when trying to pick up a dropped weapon in squad mode or LTM modes

3. Bloom bugs such as hit markers not coming, or damage numbers not being shown when making contact

4. Shotgun pellets doing incorrect damage (sometimes the crosshair isn't conpletely in the target and *does* show correct damage, obviously this isn't always the case.) This has been a bug since the inception of the game.

I'm sure there are many more I am missing but these are just a few. This post isn't about how bad the devs are, because they have made the game better besides the ignored bugs. One of my favorite things they have done is optimized the game. I have a terrible PC and a low budget, I have to run the game at the lowest possible settings. It runs for me at a steady 40 fps. Before the patches (back in October) it was running at 20-25. The devs aren't bad, but as of late they have added new elements and ignored blatant bugs.

I think one of the things we can do is to ask famous streamers to draw awareness to the absence of the devs. Dakotaz has said on stream before, ""This is the best game I have played"". DK is super chill and respectful and I think the devs share mutual respect for him. If we can get Ninja, DK, Ceez, Camills, etc. to raise awareness on Fortnite, the number one streamed game currently on Twitch, we can help provoke the devs to return this game back to its once great form.

As fun as it can be to drop at Tilted, I kinda feel like this entertainment comes at the expense of the rest of the map. Everywhere else on the map is emptier because of the chaos going on in the middle.

I think it would be cool to have an urban-themed map in Fortnite BR that was based around the Tilted Towers design. It could be a lot smaller (maybe 1/4 of the size) and a lot denser than the current map, filled with buildings and streets of various sizes. Without playtesting, it's tough to know whether this would actually work, but I think there would be potential for Tilted-style chaos at the drop, followed by tense close-quarters sneaking. Then you could remove Tilted Towers from the current map and return it to a more open outdoor style.

Most of you guys are probably unaware, but many of us have been experiencing a very annoying issue that renders the game literally unplayable for us. I reported it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/814bea/patch_310_undocumented_changesbug_megathread/dv1wavj/):

&gt;A few seconds into the match (during the bus ride or during your free fall), the game goes into a loading screen, and then [""A PROBLEM OCCURRED: Client failed to register with server.""](https://i.imgur.com/kr1WW6D.png) screen pops up, and you get kicked.

I Googled it and found a couple threads from Epic's forums, and they both had tens of pages each. One guy has found a temporary solution to this issue, which was to create a new Windows user. It did the trick. After a while, with the release of 3.1, the issue was said to be fixed (according to comments, I had no time to play). Now, with the 3.2, it's back to being an issue. I tried to play a solo game yesterday and it hit me. I checked the relevant thread [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/189921-client-failed-to-register-with-the-server/page4) (which again, was merged down with the other thread and has shrunk; many comments have been deleted), and finally a dev responded today with [this](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/189921-client-failed-to-register-with-the-server?p=204871#post204871):

&gt;Hey everyone, we're looking into this one but need some help. Can anyone supply me with game logs, in-game names, dxdiags, and your system information? To get logs check this out HERE. To get your dxdiag check this out HERE. For system information just type 'system information' into your computers search bar and take a screenshot of what you see. In order to upload logs here copy/paste them into a text file or google doc first, then upload it here. Thanks for helping everyone!

I wanted to help them with info they require, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to post on that thread. I'm already logged in to my account. My email is verified. I tried to subscribe to the forum/thread and then refresh with the hope that the 'reply/quote' button will show up, but nothing. At this point I'm not even sure if it's an individual issue, or no one else can post, period (because as you can see, no one has given the staff member the information he's requested for).

Just thought I‚Äôd share an experience that happened recently whilst playing Fortnite!

I was in a Squad game with 3 randoms who all knew eachother. We just so happened to win the game! So they sent me a friend request and I accepted.

We played all afternoon and won a few more games! The problem was, I didn‚Äôt have a mic to communicate with them, I could only hear what they were saying.

I later received a message from the 3 guys asking for my address so that they could all chip in together, buy a mic, and post it to my address!

I‚Äôve never seen friendliness and kindness like this in a game EVER?! It‚Äôs incredible who you can meet playing this game and kind people out there!

I think Epic is doing a great job at keeping up with the community's expectations.

Yesterday I ran into very sad problem. I decided to try the new game mode and hit the Fill button (Awesome mode btw), and I got matched in my squad with a man and a woman that appeared to know each other (I will refer to them as the couple from now on, whether or not they are an actual couple is irrelevant to the story) and a young boy/kid (nothing pejorative in this naming). 

All of us were using Voice chat. The couple wanted to land Lucky Landing, while all our 16 teammates wanted to land Retail row. The kid and I decided to land Retail Row (bare in mind that the bus was flying over retail row first and then going to greasy grove) but the couple did not change their mind after seeing us dropping first. This is totally fine, nothing negative was said at this point. 
Fast forward a few minutes. Another team landed RR, a lot of fights, I grabbed a couple of kills and the kid did help. Meanwhile the couple is bragging about how good their loot is etc. 2 minutes later they ran into a huge team and get killed without grabbing any kill. (They were the only two that decided to break off our team), while on the other hand, our team won RR. 
They started spectating us, with the guy spectating the kid, the woman spectating me. They then proceeded to flame us, calling us bad, then insulting us with words like retarded, stupid kid, racist slurs etc, with each insult escalating. I was not saying a thing, but the kid was desperately trying to justify himself and apologize. 
Since I am a little more experienced with toxicity(24 years old, I played other competitive games like Lol/overwatch), I know better than letting people bringing me down and I muted them quite rapidly. The kid was not doing this, and all I could hear was (from him) : ""Why are you so mean? Why do you insult me..."". My heart broke when he started crying. I commanded him to mute the two haters, and then spent the next 5 minutes reassuring him that he was not stupid / retarded etc.

The kid was by no mean the best player I have ever seen, but it does not justify cyber bullying. He was very good at heart (he even offered me a gold bolt action sniper because he told me he was bad with it). We ended up wining the game and the kid was so happy to get his first victory.

TL, DR: To protect the integrity of young people that plays the game, we need to be able to report the abusive bullys. One very simple answer is to use Voice Chat ban(temporary, increasing with the amount of repeated reports). If people are not mature enough to not ruin the experience of a kid playing video game, they should not be allowed to talk. ",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôve been playing PUBG for a few months (only 70ish hours and I‚Äôm not very good) and I am kind of interested in trying out Fortnite, especially since it is free. I initially was turned off by the cartoony look of Fortnite, but that is just a difference in style, and would probably be pretty easy to get over once I started playing. 

The bigger obstacle for my brain is the whole building mechanic. It does not look fun to me and looks like it would be hard to master. Is there a game mode without building or is it an integral part of all of Fortnite (I guess the word ‚ÄúFort‚Äù is in the title...)? Am I just being dumb? Is it easier to do than I am thinking?

I am probably going to download it and try it this weekend  anyways, just looking for some input. What else can I look forward to in Fortnite that PUBG lacks?",FortNiteBR

This is how I would implement the crafting table. It doesn't have to be a super complex thing with multiple recipes or anything. Around the map there will be crafting tables that appear as often as chests, and glow with their own unique aura and color just as chests do. When you access them you are brought to a window where you can quickly trade your resources in for basic guns, then upgrade the guns rarity with more resources. This is the basic function of the table, to alleviate the luck based aspect and add another element to the people who can't find a decent gun but can survive and gather resources. That needs to be rewarded too. So if a crafting table does ever get implemented in this fashion, then It would be nice if gun drops around the map became more rare as well. 

It adds complexity to the game as well. This is where the fun part of the crafting table comes in. There will be an option where you can try to combine two items together. There will be no recipe table, and this will be purely trial and error. Obvious ideas are a boogie bomb launcher, which would be able to be make with boogie bomb and grenade launcher of course, or you can make pre-existing items, say a medpack and shield potion gives you a big chug.

Another suggestion - Add an entirely different game mode. How this game mode begins I'm not sure, either it can give you access to the entire map at once, or instantly put you in a small circle (about the size of the circle thats not the smallest but 2nd to last or 3rd) As soon as you drop in you already have 500 of each resource and drops for good items start immediately. Basically this is to practice and just enjoy the late game experience without going through a whole BR game. I think it would be nice.

This mobile announcement should've been all positive news, instead of ""FORTNITE COMING TO MOBILE, GREAT NEWS FOR ALL GAMERS (*except those who have already invested/supported our game on Xbox*).""   

We get it Epic, Sony paid you for a partnership. This deal apparently locked us out of being able to play cross platform with our friends on PC. But now it blocks us from playing with mobile users too? Is that what you agreed to? I ask that you go back to look at the exact wording of said ""partnership/Xbox block"" and see if it will at least, and I mean AT LEAST let us use our accounts/cosmetics that we have already spent our money on the mobile version! I don't think this is too much to ask from all your fans on the Xbox version. To me, partnerships should only be marketing rights, or exclusive skins, etc, but not something that limits your game for the greater good.  

Some of you might be rolling your eyes and saying who cares about the mobile version. A lot of us want it for the other added benefits. Say you are away on vacation and don't have your Xbox with you, with the mobile version you can log in and collect your dailies, or purchase that skin that is only available for one day (before Brite Bomber is back for another 32 days in a row).  

TLDR: Did you sign a ""partnership"" that block Xbox users from giving you more money and continued excitement about the game? We don't have to have crossplay, but at the very least let us have the cross-progression as you call it with our accounts on mobile and pc... ",FortNiteBR

The solution is decreasing the amount of buildings, maybe only having one or two 6+ story buildings, and decreasing the amount of loot in general there.

Increasing the amount of buildings and maybe having some bigger buildings at Pleasant, Greasy, Retail, etc. would also help spread the population out. It‚Äôs crazy how often i‚Äôll land alone at Greasy.

Getting shot and are low on health, throw down a smoke and a 1 by 1 and heal inside, the enemy won‚Äôt be able to see you so is good for mini shields or other meds etc
Also you‚Äôre teammate is downed and you‚Äôre getting attacked, throw a smoke and revive them.
Also if you are pushing someone you can throw smoke grenades and they won‚Äôt see where you are in the smoke so it is basically an invincibility potion as long as you are inside the smoke.

I know a lot will disagree with me but I really like smoke grenades and don‚Äôt want them to be removed from the game.
I suggest to all you reading to next time you see a smoke grenade, carry it and try one of it‚Äôs uses above, I‚Äôm sure you will realize they are actually not bad, it‚Äôs just no one tried them or gave them a chance.

I don't get it...,"So I've played FPSs and other games for 20ish years. I've played many big shooters including UT, Quake, CoD, CS:S, Gears of War, and currently primarily playing Overwatch. I've seen a lot about FN BR and PUBG, and decided to try this out. I mostly play FFA so I didn't think BR style would be a big transition.

I've played about 15-20 matches so far and... I just don't get it. The mechanics I get... Find items, harvest, build, etc. But something about this game just isn't clicking. I feel like the damage is really random, lines of sight are wonky at best, and the gameplay just seems really inconsistent. Overall, this game doesn't really feel ""fun"" to me. I know I don't have much time in but Overwatch had me drawn in in the first match (I got a PotG on my 3rd game). In the games I've played of FNBR I think I've gotten maybe 4 kills. I'm not a pro at shooters by any means but I'm definitely not bad at them either.

Don't place restrictions on what your users have purchased though.  That is unfair treatment to me.

* Many people live in very loud homes and keep their mic on (without talking) so we can also hear how loud their home is
* If the vernacular these kids use today carries on into adulthood, they will either never be employed or we will have a very dumb society
* The assumption that someone is a skilled player based on their skin is outrageous. Skins are awarded for time-played, not skill.

My idea is: if you win a game u will receive a chest, which you can unlock (maybe with a easy challenge) and it will contain a random item (from v-bucks, skins over an emblem or just a new colour option for the emblem). 

I think it would fit pretty good inter current ecosystem of the game ( good players will not have the opportunity to receive unlimited v-bucks or skins because the odds are very low for them but on the other hand they are still hyped when they win a game).

Basically from what i understood (I dont play much) some of their popular 'dragon' weapons can be levelled up with playtime to grant more dmg, etc Just like weapon rarity in BR, however with patch 3.2 all their weapon stats got reset to the basic and all the effort people put in grinding got laid to thrash.

I know a lot of people say we killed paragon, which is partially true since it was the rise in fortnite that took the devs away from Paragon, however slowly it's becoming evident Epic are chasing after money. Yes i know its f2p and I respect that, but that doesen't give them a free pass for the shitload of money they earn in microtransactions. Im not saying it's bad, but Im 100% sure there are gonna be douchebags in the comments telling me i should be greatful for Epic. I am, but just because they are f2p does not mean they earn nothing, it means they have a different strategy for earning money.

This had led STW players to believe Epic is trying to juice out as much money from Fortnite as they can, and it looks like that seeing that they are now working on mobile so that more people can play and buy vbucks, and those coders probably came from the content and bug fixing team for both games.

I say, let's re-roll to patch 3.1 for a bit, so STW can have their proper weapons back, and then come back to a normal 3.2. I don't even play STW, but it hurts to see a community get fucked up like this when BR is over here gliding. If Epic goes down this path, STW will have the same fate as paragon, and lets not forget STW is the reason for our existence, and the players there made this mode f2p.

Let's show STW we care about them.

EDIT: answer for a question many are asking:
Im saying revert it for a bit so Epic can fix the problem. in patch 3.1 sTW was fine. Let them fix the issue and then we come back to 3.2. Just to show STW that we support, because even though epic could re-roll the patch for STW only, it would still cause some problems, so they might as well just reset it to normal rather than working backwards.

But then I realized that it's just terrible for everyone.

Let's state the obvious - it's an obvious cash in. Epic wants fortnite to be even bigger, that's obvious. But this is not the way to do this.

Most of the casual players probably won't even be able to play the game correctly - because 1. It's a graphically intense game on UE4 that I doubt will be optimized on mobile for a long time and 2. It's a third person shooter (WITH BUILDING MECHANICS) which is gonna make it even harder for players to play on touch controls, without a controller, kb+m...or an emulator.

Which leads to the next subjects - emulators.

PC players who will get tired of losing games on PC will get a mobile emulator, and wreck some android players on their servers. And the fact that apparently andrid stats and wins convert over to other systems, this gives players even more incentive to do so and abuse the system. THough soon they won't even need an emulator, because epic is planning PC AND ANDROID CROSSPLAY... what the fuck?

Also patches will be a lot slower or have less content due to the fact they have to focus on multiple platforms now.

Tldr: epic please don't do this. Focus on PC and consoles instead.",FortNiteBR

I don't know what's causing it but you need to look into it. Tacticals at purple/blue &amp; pumps shouldn't be hitting single digit numbers when you're in someone's face. Even if my reticle was even slightly off their body. Take a number, add it to the shotguns that you think is low enough, and stick with it. Stop rolling a dice everytime I take a shot at someone. I don't want randomness in a Battle Royale where I'm trying to outlive 99 other people. I have to outdo them in building, surviving, killing, strategy, shooting, etc. And when I'm in a situation where I've been successfully been doing all of that and I rushed someone in a 1v1 I made weak, I expect to finish him off with a shotgun shot that'll kill, not tickle him.

With the recent introduction of mobile Fortnite, xbox has yet again been excluded from cross-play whilst the other platforms can all play with eachother.

From what I understand, Sony are unwilling to implement cross-play with xbox users, whilst Microsoft have openly said they support it. Surely if Epic Games included xbox into the cross-play, Sony would either have to decide whether they wanted to accept it or opt-out, which they would decide to stay considering the popularity of the game. It doesn't seem to make sense why PS4 users were put into the cross-play pool when Sony are the only ones against the idea of doing it with xbox.

It just seems wrong how xbox are excluded when they want to be a part of it, and Sony are included even though they are the ones who refuse to play with xbox. If Sony doesn't want cross-play? Don't prioritize them over Microsoft, it's their loss at the end of the day and they're depriving an entire community from joining in on the fun. Also, this isn't a post to say that I want PS4 players out of the cross-play, I'm simply saying that Sony is the reason why xbox isn't included, so they shouldn't have priority.

If not, is it possible to have two different pools of where xbox users can cross-play with PC and mobile, and PS4 have their own version of the same thing. Let me know what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

I have 2 friends, Bill and Ted (not their real names), who I used to talk about video games with. I wouldnt say we were best friends, but they were still good people and I enjoyed hanging out with them. We would talk about video games all the time, ranging from Elder Scrolls to Assassins Creed, Battlefield to Minecraft. We had a good thing going on -- until Fortnite came along. 

Ironically enough, I was the one who introduced them to the game. I found out about it back when it was just the PvE ""Save the World"" mode, and told them about it. They thought it was interesting and looked it up, only to to find out that it had added a brand new battle royale mode. I fucking hate multiplayer games, save for Battlefield (idk why I like it over the others), but even with BF I still get pissed as hell playing it. So I just brushed it aside and let them do their thing, but then it turned into something big. 

Before I knew it, Fortnite was everywhere -- and my friends were talking about it nonstop. Its all they ever fucking talk about anymore. Fortnite, fortnite, and more goddamn fortnite. Jesus fucking christ its annoying. They dont even have exciting stories to tell. 90% of their conversations are as follows:

Bill: Bro you know what I did on Fortnite last night?

Ted: No, what ya do?

Bill: Some guy was chasing me, so I hid around the corner in a bush, then he just walked right past me, so I shot him in the back and took his stuff

Ted: OMG BRO NO WAY 

Bill: I KNOW RIGHT IT WAS AWESOME

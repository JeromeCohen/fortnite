&amp;nbsp;

We mentioned in the August [State of Development](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-august-2018) blog that we’ve been working towards adding sub-region matchmaking. We’ve just enabled this feature for the Southeast Asian region. Follow the link above for all the technical details and read more below for additional information.

&amp;nbsp;

**What’s sub-region matchmaking?**

This is a new feature we’ve implemented that will find the data-centers that are available in your region, determine which one provides you the healthiest connection, then place you in a queue that is pinged to that location to give you the best available connection. Depending on your location, players will experience varying improvements to their ping and other network related performance.

&amp;nbsp;

**When will this feature be implemented?**

As of today, September 10, we have launched the Singapore data-center and implemented the logic that allows for sub-region matchmaking. While Asia will be the first region to receive this, we plan on enabling this matchmaking process worldwide in the future. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Will I always connect to the closest sub-region?**

**No.** Not in cases where the player population for any given platform/playlist combination is not sufficient to guarantee a reasonable matchmaking queue time. In cases like this players will be defaulted back to the “primary” data-center for the region for that match.  So you may notice a difference in your in-match network conditions if you ping better to Singapore than Tokyo depending on the time of day you’re playing, the platform you play on, and the playlist you select. We will be monitoring this feature closely and making adjustments as we find the right balance between network performance and match wait times.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is the endgame?**

Our final vision and goal for sub-region matchmaking is to allow players for each region to automatically connect to the data-center which offer them the best possible network experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

As we expand this functionality to other regions, we will be able to both provide significantly better service to underserved areas as well as optimize the experience for players in regions which already operate out of multiple geographically distributed data-centers. We’ll continue to determine which regions would best benefit from additional data-centers and keep you updated on these new locations as we add them.

&amp;nbsp;

Please continue giving us your feedback on this new feature and let us know what you think!

The Drum Gun embodies every single bad decision Epic Games has ever made (god knows they make a lot of them). It was core to the rise of the spray meta, and still is after its nerf (which allegedly did nothing). Yes, I mean the patch where they also nerfed the Dual Pistols (? good job Epic, that one really was necessary).

This gun embodies the intended reduction of the skill gap of the game by our godly developers to cater to casual / bad players (the main source of income). It does so by targeting the biggest skill indicator in the game : building. That was further shown with the nerf to the materials' starting hp, which Epic did not have the choice to revert after the backlash. (Wow they're amazing!)

It's been more than 2 months since its release, and it is still the single meta defining weapon, reducing loadout/playstyle diversity. 

I have come to not expect good things from Epic, but I still hope that, at the very least, the Drum Gun will be vaulted for the start of the next season.

Have a great day/night.

My husband loves it, and I have taken to watching some of his games while I’m winding down for the night. The game looked like fun (and also super complicated. Which is why I never bothered to try it before). Anyway, I started in playground, and then after poking around here, decided I should try 50v50 to get some good practice building and shooting for real. 

Well, I got knocked pretty quickly, which was to be expected. My husband was watching me, giving me tips. A teammate came up and healed me. My husband said ‘wow, that’s unexpected for 50v50. Do an emote to thank them.’ 

I had just learned how to do emotes like 30 minutes prior, so I panicked and quickly clicked through to do one before they ran off - the one I landed on was the ‘popcorn’ emote. 

My husband let me know that that was a pretty bitch move of me to do, but also couldn’t stop laughing. 

Soooo if you healed a super noob in 50v50 last week, and they popcorned you once they got up - my bad. Thanks for healing me. 

Also, I got my very first kill last night and I was so excited that I snap chatted all my husbands squad people. (I don’t know the lingo yet)

They were very proud of me. This game is fun. ",FortNiteBR

People are very afraid of this happening to skull trooper, and it is understandable

So here I present a solution to the issue

Epic should do something similar to the Tomatohead challenges. A set of skull trooper challenges that would upgrade skull trooper, so that people who already have skull trooper still have its rarity. After around a week, which should be enough time for everyone to complete the challenges, skull trooper gets put into the shop.

That way, the original skull trooper owners can still keep a rare skull trooper, and everyone else gets skull trooper.

For the upgraded skull trooper, this so called ""leaked"" skin can be used (down below)

It’s stupid how I can spam your wall trying to get in but since you have better ping I can’t get in because your wall builds faster then I can enter. 

It’s also off putting the other way around, whenever I build a stair, wall, floor etc and people jump through it easily and kill me because of it. 

Now this isn’t me complaining because i’m a potato but instead of where I think Epic messed up and how they can possibly improve the game. At least in my eyes. 

Imo, the game started going downhill around whatever patch nerfed shotguns to hell &amp; buffed turbo building to the point where you can hold it and it will build anywhere you look. 

Shotguns whatever ya know, no point in beating a dead horse anymore. It’s obvious epic doesn’t really want to touch shotguns anymore. 

But turbo building on the other hand. I think they should nerf it just enough where you can get into a box where someone is turtling and just holding left click. (Obviously if you’re faster with individual clicks I feel you should be faster than someone just holding turbo build)

I don’t need to tell you how much of a problem this really is. Yeah turbo building is great and all but I really feel like it’s too op.",FortNiteBR

As the title suggests, the need to be able to select a piece without placing it to pre edit it is really no longer needed. 

I can understand for rotating the piece sure but if all I had to do was place 1 piece down before I could rotate it. I would take that over this 2 click ( or click and hold WITH delay) shit ALL day. Kinda frustrating I have to slow down my gameplay because the game can't keep up with what I want to do.

So many times I have needed to pull out and place a floor above me quickly while being pressured, but since it has a delay it makes it useless trying to heal in between an enemy shooting out floors/pyramid's trying to get in.

Add a toggle so that the people who like the current system can keep as is. But allow those of us using controller, a way to push above the current building speed, and get that skill gap ceiling pushed just that touch higher. The delay makes it feel super clunky.

 There's many videos of people explaining exactly what I'm talking about and what's wrong with it on youtube, that have a few 100k views if you need a visual of what I'm talking about.

Bursts and Automatics are comparable, and it pretty much comes down to personal preference.

Pump and Tac both have the respective places as early game shotguns, the pump being the higher damage, slower fire rate option.

Double Barrel vs Heavy once again comes down to opinion. The double barrel is the only thing I’m iffy about but considering it legit can’t be used outside of 5 meters, I don’t find too big of a problem with it.

Semi vs Hunting Rifle vs Bolt vs Heavy: once again, all preference based, all pretty well balanced and have their respective places and uses.

LMG: Close Range, extremely inaccurate, good for breaking down builds but not much else.

SMG’s aren’t bad either due to their limited magazines and high very rate, it’s easy to counter.

Splodes are whatever but I feel like the Tommy is the lone thing holding this meta from actually being really terrific. It baffles me as to how Epic just made all those changes in the last patch and left the Tommy completely untouched. What are your guys’ thoughts?

Loot lake will be drained by the cube. 

The cube is a device used by an alien race called the enforcers (the week 7 skin I believe) which place domes around the map as they cannot survive the normal atmosphere. 

Wailing woods bunker will be turned into a chicken diner and eventually turned into a theme park. 

Lonely lodge will be damaged from the cube exploding at loot lake and will be turned into a tourist place like dusty depot diner with rideable canoes, caves and rivers.

Loot lake will have a large black hole where users will be able to enter the dark world where they can go around the map but they cannot see other players and other players cannot see them, and the use of weapons is disabled. 

The season 6 battle pass skins will get the dark variant when in the dark world. 

This information came a day before that week 10 loading screen showing the Brite Bomber touching the cube and the dark variant of them showing was added to the game. 

When the cube gets to loot lake it will be the start of season 6, the little cutscene will show the drift outfit (battlepass tier 1 outfit) touching the cube and the cube zapping them but they are not being affected until the cube explodes.

May I also say how loot has been popping out of loot lake over the past few days, this may be related or a bug, I’m not sure!

The route of the cube has already been leaked but here is the rundown of locations left to go.

- West side of wailing woods (inside the forest)
- South of Lazy Links
- South of Pleasant Park

1 - have more interactive game modes like high stakes, people like something new especially when you can earn items 

2 - Make battle pass challenges something different, trust me, people aren’t going to keep doing he the same exact challenges for “skins” if the game gets boring they’re going to flat out quit.

I actually have a pretty big theory that I've fine tuned with the help of reading other theories. I think the Enforcers may be a group of individuals (As seen in week 7, they are multiple people) that come from the future with the cube and are using it to potentially destroy/reshape many areas of Fortnite's world for a reason that may be devastating for their future, or some other reason I haven't plugged. The description for the skin is ""Balance and order must be restored.""

Brite Bomber is from the future. Her description is ""The future looks bright...."" and I feel the dots represent a mix of hope and despair. She knows what the future looks like already and came back to Fortnite's world long ago to change something. Brite Bomber see's Dark Bomber, or whoever that is, through the cube because it's a reflection of what she will become in the future now that the cube is in place. This is why she looks so distraught about it in week 10's loading screen. The Enforcers may have a messed up vision of how they should fix things and it may result in a mix between future and present, or cause good people to turn evil or something.

All of the loading screens leading up to Week 7 were basically Brite Bomber and Drift having fun, but I think there's more to it. His description is ""Journey into the unknown, and find your way to victory."" Drift goes one upgrade in every loading screen, implying he's been earning experience and training. He's from Earth, representing one of us. She may have seen something different in him, and decided he'd be a good candidate to train in order to prepare for a way she had to stop the future from becoming ""dark"" instead of ""bright"". All of the loading screens are the break times and bonding experiences they have between the training. It also would explain why some ordinary human is in some crazy outfit that eventually even spews lightning.

However, week 9's loading screen doesn't fit very well with my theory because it just shows Drift fooling around. I feel like if he was tasked to be the chosen one to deal with this alongside Brite Bomber, he would have been more serious by week 9. That's the only part I can't understand.

Brite Gunner, Bomber's counterpart, hasn't been seen at all during any of this. His description is ""Look on the bright side"". I think he will play a key role in season 6, when we'll be plagued with evil, to help Brite Bomber and any other new skin/old skin overcome what's become of them.",FortNiteBR

2 blue emotes.
1 Purple, 70'ish tiers.
First legendary, moonwalk emote, in the 90 range of tiers.

Corruption is the main ""theme"" although it's held loosely.
By popular request from the staff team, ""Kevin"" is the Tier 100 skin, which acts similarly to the Galaxy Skin, where the skin is a moving picture. It'll be the same type of purplish-black glow as the cube, and ""glitch"" out, resulting in a good skin that fits the previous Tier 100 skins. (Darker theme)

You will be able to select music from the current theme, to the old one. Unknown on whether this is accessible to free players.
You will also be able to select battle bus music, and theme (christmas, birthday.) More to come in the following months!
Weapon skins are also coming, they already have different weapon skins depending on the weapon level in Save The World.
2D emotes will be the minority, you will see these the least in the Battle Pass.
There will also be Vehicle Decorations.

Similarly to how Burnout got a female counterpart, ""Dark Bomber"" is going to be an early skin! The rest are mostly loosely themed, but I can tell you with certainty that you won't be disappointed!

**Map Changes**

The staff messed around and is giving you guys a sneak peek on Loot Lakes future demise. Lava Lake, will be this seasons Dusty Divot, or Moisty Mire, if you will. This area will be drastically changed.

Loot Lake is no more, the cube will flop on over, and preceding the end of the Season, there will be no live event in which the volcano forms. But you will see some cool effects based on all of the Runes, I won't spoil it for you guys! ;)

Of the affected area, tilted will be slightly effected, as will pleasant Park. Epic toyed around with the desert mechanics, I can't say for certain, but the NorthWestern region of the map will either be snowy, or the empty spot (hogwarts) will include a new POI. They've become dissatisfied with Junk Junction, and the stadium was a flop.

In the Twitter promo video showing the Capoeria emote, many pointed out ""Crazy Castle"" POI being shown off on the right side.
This was a big mistake. They've been planning this location since Season 2, hence the theme of knights, and spicing up the map even further. This was scrapped but was heavily considered and will join the map in Season 6.
The Viking village will stay, don't worry.

Every spot that Kevin burned a rune into, there will be a new POI there, all of which are small, with the exception of loot lake. So don't expect anything huge.

Wailing woods will not be what it once was, this is a spot which Kevin has burned into, you'll expect to see some fun changes.

Oh and Factory/Factories will be back later into the season.

**Misc**

The item shop is getting revamped. 3 featured items is the key, with 8 daily items. It will look complicated but will function very well.

While this last update improved the switch drastically, Nintendo will work harder to push 60fps. I can't promise it'll happen, but Switch owners could see a good FPS bump in the future. Nintendo will also work on an exclusive cosmetic with the modelling team. Amiibo could also function in-game to prevent everyone from signing into a switch to get the exclusive, but this isn't definite.

Epic Games accounts will have the ability to go offline.

AFAIK there will be a lobby background which centers the volcano.

Animated loading screens will definitely be a thing. These were tested by the getaway LTM loading screens, they have little effect on gameplay and loading times.

Skin Preset options will be present for those with 2+ skins.

Durrr Burger meal will become a consumable in the game, can be found in many restaurant like areas (this is why dusty diner was introduced, for the blank point in the middle) and will restore your health or shield to 100. It depends which one is lower. If you have 50 shield and 15 health. It will restore your health.

Slurp Juice now stacks to 3.

Clingers will be vaulted.

The crossbow will come back.

Pump Shotgun will revert to the Grey/Green colour scheme to accurately represent it's effectiveness. The tactical shotgun will not change.

To increase effectiveness and gameplay versatility, any type of grenade will be held in a separate new slot, that does not take up trap or inventory slots. AFAIK pressing Rb/Lb, R1/L1, and R/L on consoles will activate this ability. 

Smoke grenades will come back.

A higher quality map will be implemented.


Expect much more changes for QoL. This is all I feel like saying, this will be the biggest change to the game since v3.0, please give your support to the staff, it really helps push through the stress.",FortNiteBR

I assume people aren't spending a ton of money right now because new games are coming out, they are tired of Season 5, they didn't like the skins in the store, and lets be honest the performance is just pitiful. Whatever the reason, I assume Epic decided to roll out the Power Chord as an easy way to grab some money. The same thing happened with the Red Knight. They released it right in the middle of the whole SMG thing, and I guarantee V-Buck purchases were at an all time low.

Why is this important? Because if we plan ahead and spend no money in late October, I would bet my left nut that we will see the Skull Trooper on Halloween. ",FortNiteBR

Most people got it only for the back bling, and few actually liked the look of it. But now that nearly half a year has passed before it has returned, people are ready to spend everything they have just to get it, and there must be a reason.  I think it's because of the ""rarity"" of it not being in the store for so long that has people wanting to get it so badly. And I can't think of any other skin that has been gated by time this long to warrant such hype and praise for it.

Reminds me of that Steam Dev Days video, where one of the panel speakers says that people don't even care how it looks, they like a specific item just because of its perceived rarity.

You get in a position where you are in a box with an enemy. This happens a lot when you are in a build fight and fighting to obtain the high ground. Anyway lets analyze your options if you are in this situation. The trap is placed you have .5 seconds to react. You either 1. figure out which wall the trap is on fast enough and destroy that trap and walk out of the box or 2. destroy any of those walls so you can escape. 

Now I am all for a nice trap kill. I appreciate them. It's a solid way to show your skill level if you can trap someone. Now here is why I am making this post. The skill level has gone down. Epic has made it where it takes literally no skill at all to trap someone, So now everyone is doing it and not even trying to build and shoot eachother. Odds are you will miss a shot or two and not kill them in time and they can place that trap before you kill them because of how quick the trap goes off after you place it. 

Here is my situation that has happened. I would be fine if there was a concrete way to get out of a box with even one trap, but there is not a way at all to do that against a smart player. They box you in and place a trap if it's only one you could destroy it but more likely you can't react in time because its .5 seconds so the overall reaction is break out of that box using the closest wall you got. Well here comes builder pro. all they have to do is hold left click on the wall that you are hitting and boom you are stuck in that box with no possible way out without taking damage. There is not a point in the game where you can hold W and break the wall so you are able to get out in time, builder pro is too fast for you to do that. 

The only suggestion that I have is make the reaction time a little bit more than .5 seconds or do something about builder pro, or lower the trap damage to a point where it's still a nice play but you won't lose 90% of your health because odds are you are not getting out of that box with these tools that have been given to players and you are dead even if you reacted fast enough and its just the system not allowing you to be rewarded for that.

What do you guys think? Am I just a noob or have you experienced the box with no way out after trying SMG spam and pickaxe spam?",FortNiteBR

The LMG has a large magazine as well, but low accuracy to balance it. Light ammo SMGs have a smaller magazine and very high damage falloff, but great close range accuracy. These weapons are balanced well. 

Then there’s the drum gun. It’s accurate, does a shit ton of damage, has great range, and holds FIFTY bullets.

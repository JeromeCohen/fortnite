They're either too easy or too hard; too short or too long; they either reward you simply for playing the game or take you out of the main game to play mini-games. No matter what Epic does, somebody is going to complain about the state of the Weekly Challenges. 

If you're one of the people who complain about the Weekly Challenges then I've got some good news for you: The Weekly Challenges aren't for you.

Most of the people who complain about the Weekly Challenges being too easy are the top X% of players who can level up quite easily on Eliminations and Wins alone. These are the same people who suggest Epic add a ""Win a game"" Weekly Challenge when the majority of players probably only win one or two matches a Season let alone a week. 

The Weekly Challenges have more casual players in mind. They exist for people who are lucky to get one or two kills a game and who probably luck their way in to a Victory Royale every now and again. It's a way for those players to level up without having to be great at the game. It gives them something to do when they get frustrated at being beaten in to the ground game after game. 

Which brings me on to my next point...

The Weekly Challenges are designed to extend your playtime by adding other objectives besides the main objective (survive) to the game. That's why multi-stage challenges exist, to make you play for longer. If you could complete all the challenges in one match then most people would probably end up playing less.

Now this isn't to say that you shouldn't be doing the Weekly Challenges. They're a good way to level up your Battle Pass if you don't get to play that often and they're a nice distraction from the main game but please, if you're gonna complain about them, maybe take a moment to think about why they exist in the first place.",FortNiteBR

Step One: Change your Xbox Gamertag / PSN Name. (It may cost $$)

Step Two: Change your Fortnite Display Name (Using Epic Games Website) (Don't Forget to save and *IMPORTANT* make your Fortnite Display Name the same as your Gamertag / PSN Name)

Step Three: Open the Fortnite game in your console. (If your name is still the same as your old one in the game, Quit Fortnite and Restart your console)

Step Four: After Restarting your Console, Open Fortnite and your new name should be there in the lobby and in the game.

I actually did this and it worked (I did this last Sunday)

If this did not work comment and tell me the problem. I might be able to help you. I did this on Xbox and changed my Gamertag and Fortnite Display Name from GamingAbel101 to AbelMinarYT. 

If you are on PC just change your display name. *You can only change your display name ONCE every TWO Weeks*

I used to love this game from Season 1 until early Season 4. I never bought any skins as I never understood why I would buy a set of pixels but I used to play about 5 games every 2 days. That changed at the start of Season 4. The game got too childish, a lot of the locations were changed and it just didn't have that feeling that it once used to have to it.

Why ? I think I know why very well as probably others do too. Epic Games keeps listening to the children playing this game. The moment I saw the fact that Season 4 was based on super-heroes I knew it wasn't to be the same game and, at least for me, I was right. It's still sad to think that a game which I have played for months became a disaster and all because of the bigger part of the community consisting of children under 12 year of age.

Epic Games should stop listening to their suggestions. I understand that a lot of them wanted the classic skins back and they did come back but a lot of the owners of these skins were mad, and I understand why. I like to collect money for example and I have banknotes that are way over 100 years old. I would be extremely mad if they were to be reprinted now as mine which I spent years to collect were as valuable as ones that you can find pretty much everywhere. The game is 12+ and there's a reason for it.

Now this is coming from somebody whose favourite games when I was 5 were Resident Evil, Half Life, Fallout and DOOM but that's not what matters here. What matters is that the developers of games shouldn't listen to every random child. If you are to listen to somebody listen to a person with experience in this domain, not just any player. They should only listen to people who have played way more games and that can speak for the majority of the people, not just to the audience that brings them the most money.

To me Fortnite is becoming nothing but a memory. I will try to remember the best parts of it like when I used my first trap and it killed somebody or how I sniped a player while hiding in the bushes in order to win the game but sometimes we have to know how to let go of part of our lives, whether it's a game or something else.",FortNiteBR

When games get this big, no game is going to kill it. Let’s use Minecraft as an example. I never saw a game come out and kill Minecraft, it kinda just withered away by itself. (no pun intended) So, what I’m saying is, Fortnite most likely won’t be killed by another game unless some revolutionizing game comes out which is unlikely. Fortnite will just slowly die as other games come out and and people become bored of the game. 

When Fortnite dies, that’s when the entire Battle Royale genre dies. I think that’s why Fortnite will die faster than what Minecraft did, because Minecraft was game with endless possibilities with no rules. Battle Royales can become repetitive very easily. 

Y’know Minecraft is still played by a lot of people today but not even close to the numbers of people were paying at their peak. So, if the developers were to keep sending out constant updates and new items,

I want to apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes and typos, but english is not my first language ...

I play Fortnite since the release. I'm an older guy (44) and I started gaming when I was 8 years old. It's a fact that my reflexes aren't comparable to all these kids in between the age of 10 to 16. So when I discovered Fortnite back in August 2017, I instantly realized that my own son (11) would soon be better than myself and so it was. By now I have accumulated a little over 200 wins, but only 19 in solos, around 50 in Duos and the rest in squads where I was carried from start to finish most of the time, sometimes by my son's friends. All in All I would call myself the typical adult recreational gamer.

My point is this: Whenever I encounter one of these so called sweaty kids in their soccer gear with Love Ranger wings that we all know, it's not their building abilities that send me back to the lobby, it's the constant bunnystyle jumping while shotgunning my sorry face that makes me mad. My aim is pretty solid, average I would say. By this I mean that I do MISS some shots from  time to time, especially when using shotguns. But nowadays these sweaty kids jump at you from their 5 story tower that they errect within a second and shotgun you in the face and that results in insta-death all the time. I cannot defend myself against this. I learned how to deal with these building pros over the time but the shotgun-to-the-face-thing is just something that I never can counter. If you're not able to hit every single of your own shotgun shots you're dead every single time. 

another approach: The shotgun is imho - besides the sniper weapons - the only gun that can kill you with a single shot if you're running around on average HP, let's say 75 health and 50 shields. EVERY other gun needs at least a couple of hits to kill you and I like that. It gives me a chance to react when I'm attacked. But when one of these modern kids jumps me with his shotgun and his building skills ther's nothing I can do ... 

Please dont get me wrong: I dont want to sound like a whiny person ... I accepted the fact that I keep dying to these Shotgun-Kids a long time ago, but can we have - at least for a limited time - a mode WITHOUT shotguns, so that everybody needs at least two or three hits on a player to actually take him out?

I would be OK if EPIC calls it the ""Old-Man-Mode"" ...",FortNiteBR

Whenever I go into solos, every other player I come across in the lobby is a really good player, and I have to sweat my a** off to kill them, let alone to try to get a win. However when I go into squads, all 3 of my teammates are default skins, 2 of which are afk and the other one never lands where we mark, and dies within 20 seconds of landing.

This has really been annoying me lately and I just can't get my head around why the players I come across in solos are all gods, while the players I get put with in squads are all complete bots. If anyone else out there has experienced a similar thing then please let me know, because Its really sucking all the fun out of the game for me.

It doesn't matter, it's supposed to be more casual and keep players coming in, but good players and bad players alike need a separate ranked mode. Not random pop-up cups with almost identical rules to pubs, an actually ranked mode, with the same core mechanics and a different rule set.

**I think I speak for all of the competitive community when I say this is what we want in competitive modes.**

**The increased farm rate, shields/health per kill, and mats per kill (aside from the fact that mats no longer go into your inventory) are good changes. I think 500/500/500 is a little low but it's not too terrible.**

Storm: Should have a predictable late-game pattern to eliminate RNG determining who gets zone on crazy storm shifts.

Deagle: Nerf/Vault

RPGs: Should only spawn in supply drops, and should be nerfed. Rockets should only drop in stacks of 1 from ammo crates.

Chests: Should have a guaranteed healable 100% of the time. All items should be at least uncommon.

Shotguns: In a decent state but you don't need 4 different pumps. Grey tac should be vaulted or tacs should be buffed in general. (And please fix the issue of these guns not shooting at all. Other guns have this issue as well)

Grey/Green Pistol: Vault or severely buff

Dynamite: Vault

Chiller Grenade: Vault

Bottle Rockets: Vault

Mounted Turret: Vault

Sneaky Snowman: Vault

Bush: Vault

Boogie Bombs: Nerf to a much shorter stun time or vault

Balloons: Either nerf to make them much louder or vault

**Even though most of these items aren't ""op,"" they clog the already severely RNG based looting system. It goes without saying but RNG should be absolutely minimal in the competitive scene.**

Planes: No turret, no booster, 100% spawn rate

Quad: 100% Spawn rate

Rifts: 100% Spawn rate

Players: Should start with max health and shield to eliminate RNG. Mats should be immediately put into a players inventory after a kill. If you are the last to damage a player before they die, you should get the kill.

Edits: Should be as they are, however, you should be able to edit your opponents builds after you kill them.

Traps: Should become yours after killing an opponent (Maybe. Not as important but a suggestion)

Building: Remove turbo building delay

Remove circle when switching between shotguns, to fix the double pump, just make it so you have to pump the gun before you can shoot it (as in, shoot, switch, the second pump has to actually pump, and then shoot. Double pump solved).

Audio in general needs a huge improvement.

Ziplines should have a button to activate.

Many various bugs that have been around for ages still haven't been touched. Please prioritize fixing what you already have before adding more items to an already clogged loot system.

I think that's all the main ones. I used to love this game, I hope Epic can make amends to their mistakes.

**It's sad that a game like Apex can come out and upon release do things so much better and more intuitively. For now, I'll be playing that, but if Fortnite gets fixed and competitive gets sorted out (WE WANT AN ACTUAL RANKED MODE) then I'll be back.**",FortNiteBR

**now im pretty sure epic aren't changing  planes and ziplines because their intentions for this season were to have them act as some sort of item (like the hop-rocks, rifts and ghost rocks). and seeing as most of them were removed as their season ended (excluding rifts) i think epic are waiting until season 7 has ended to remove them.**

this is still really bad as we have been asking for them to remove them since i'd say a quarter into the season, and is partially why i don't know if i can trust epic with massive things such as zip lines and planes. who knows maybe we gets submarines next season, literally acting the same as the planes.

So basically Fortnite has been bombarded with incidents of stream sniping almost every season. Streamer mode and Anonymous mode helped but the problem is still there. It got worse for streamers apparently in the recent pop up cup since these modes are not allowed there.

So, suppose there is no kill feed on anyone's screen, then is it really possible to stream snipe? or, suppose in the kill feed, we make a slight change. A player can see only his/her own elims in the kill feed. He/she can't see any other elims/knock outs. Plus, no one else can see that player's elims. What do you think? Will this eliminate the problem of stream sniping?

one of the main reasons I don't like playing it is because, the challenges are too grindy, and I get DESTROYED almost every match! and if you get destroyed every match, every match feels like this

1#. drop

2# get a good gun

3# miss almost every shot

Season 2-4 were probably the best seasons in my opinion. I got to battle people without having to worry about getting hit by a plane. I'm pretty sure this post had been made before, but I've been having a lot of problems lately and why not go to Reddit about it. #1 I've been having problems with pumps. Every time I play the game I shoot my shotgun (or at least I click on my mouse) and instantly switch to my SMG. But guess what, my shotgun doesn't even fire. How long do you have to wait for you're gun to fire. And I know it may be like shorter than a second and someone's probably gonna say ""it's not even that long just wait"". But in a game like this, where I get rushed by sweats it's important. And bloom is really annoying. I literally have to stay still to actually shoot at someone, and I'm probably going to get shot. Not only that, if you are using an AR, and you aren't staying still, and the other person is, they hit all their shots on me, while I probably hit one shot. Deagles are pretty OP, being able to one shot wood with one is broken. Ziplines need an interaction button. I have a maximum in 27 ping but still have really big lags, and someone's I spike up to 300 ping right in the middle of battles. Planes need a lower health bar.

Imagine if you were to die, and when holding O or whatever button you do to exit the game, it initiates matchmaking and allows you to continue spectating the game you just died in. Then, when the server is ready, you take a simple loading screen ride over to the new server.

This would be a great way to reduce unnecessary time loading in and out. Obviously we sometimes like to change our cosmetics, but for those days where the loading screen is just a slowdown, perhaps we could merge it so one could simply spectate the game that just ended until the new game is ready.

Lets start with planes:

They are too overpowered and annoying. There is \[roughly\] nothing to balance it out. The planes feel like Season 3 guided missile. Just with mounted turrets. And they fly. Forever.

The planes were fun within the first 3 weeks but then all hell broke loose.

The amount of tryhards and otherwise toxic players:

I enjoyed fortnite season 4 to 6. People didn't ram planes in your face every 5 minutes. Epic needs to implement Player Based Matchmaking into the game so casual players (like me) will get in games with other casuals. Also, the toxicity of fortnite has reached it's peak point, making it \[almost\] impossible to play on fill. I know, epic cant do anything to fix that. But they could do something with Player Based Matchmaking.

Amount of Vaulted/Annoying weapons:

I feel like the amount of vaulted and unneeded guns has risen. Epic has vaulted almost half the guns which they've brang out since season 1. Yeah, some of them where long awaiting the vault however some others where unneeded.  The grapple , for example, got vaulted because of an easily fixable bug. However there may be other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have to say, thanks for your time and patience.

I’ve one two solos and one squad and I’ve gotten close to winning a couple times. (Recently got second, died to a Mello skin with a rocket launcher).

I use a Pro controller instead of the Joycons. (And I believe I use the combat pro if that’s what it’s called)

I’d really like some tips to get better at the game and win more. I am sort of okay at building and fine at shooting people (got an 8 kill game once, my highest probably, died though.) any tips are welcome. Thank you for any help! ❤️

I dont really play everyday (especially since getting to tier 100)  and to be honest i do mostly play for fun and not for kills or wins, but i still lose like 90% of my fights, sometimes to actual noobs. I recently got to play off my friends pc where i got good fps and though I didn’t win a game, i did win more fights and got about 3-5 kills per game in the few games i played (compared to my usual 2 kills at best, if i even get a kill at all).


So i was wondering if my laptop just not being meant for gaming and therefore me getting fps drops on top of my bad fps when there’s a lot of building or more than about 5 players in a small area is what’s making me play so badly, or if i just happened to get lucky in the few games i played on my friends pc. 

I did consider getting a gaming pc, but due to my current situation I won’t really be able to get one until christmas this year. What i wanna know is if i’m really just a horrible player, or could it be that my laptop is just horrible for gaming and the fps make me lose fights? knowing myself i will lose interest in the game eventually (won’t be anytime soon but i know that eventually it will happen) and since i havent really found that many other games i’d enjoy playing, i dont wanna drop 1000€ on a new pc to play just one game, when my laptop is great for everything else i need it for, its just not meant for gaming.",FortNiteBR

Why I think half of you are clowns, and why I think this game is so great.","Context: Literally started playing the day after Christmas. Since then I’ve played a lot. I bought the battlepass early January. I’m at tier 100. Level 79. So I didn’t get all of the XP bonuses early on. 

I won a solo Battle Royale within the first four days. I didn’t deserve it. I have won four solos total. All within the first two weeks. That’s because I played on my iphone. ADS is OP on my iPhone. I didn’t even consider picking up a shotgun on the iPhone. I’ll melt your face off with a sub. Lock on, and that’s that ass. 

On January 12, I switched to XBOX. I have a few squad and duos wins since I switched. No Solos. ADS is not OP on my XBOX. I had to reinvent my game on XBOX. I use shotguns. The game IMO is also much more fun. 

I have a mic. I don’t understand some of “you people” don’t have mics. Stop spending your money on skins and buy a damn mic. “Shoot, move, communicate.” 

I bought the Rex skin upon its most recent release. This somehow gets me street cred. I play with no skins way better than me, and some of you will act like assholes to them even though they’re better than me. Then you follow me around like I know WTF is actually going on just because I have an epic skin, and I can communicate cardinal directions when we’re in contact. Stop being jerks. And stop boogie bombing your teammates. 

This game is challenging. That’s what makes it great. It’s different. The building mechanism is fascinating. The culture of FN is fascinating. I do okay as a noob, because I’ve watched a few videos that explained that I should keep my shotgun at eye-level and other basic building tips. Also, I practice. 

I shouldn’t win regularly. If I did it would cheapen the Victory Royale when it does happen. ",FortNiteBR

Enforcer - Enforcing is typically associated with an authority figure, namely police officers who enforce the law. They came through rifts which are shown to sometimes be the gateway to other dimensions. Therefore they are inter dimensional authority figures that try and restore balance (as the skin description reads) inter dimensionally when needed. 

Restoring balance in this case being returning the motel sign and they might behind returning the Tomatohead back to the island as well. I personally think if they are trying to restore balance and are enforcing presumably inter dimensional law, they were after The Visitor as well as trying to correct the results of his crime which my guess would be miss-use of dimension hopping and tearing a giant fracture in space and time.

It’s known that the cube is the heart of the storm king in stw (I’m not too sure on that). So maybe The Enforcers found the perfect opportunity to seal up the tear by dumping whatever remaining energy the huge rift in the sky had to the BR Island using the cube. This sealed up the main rift while getting rid of the worry of the storm king ever returning. All that stuff with cube monsters afterwards wasn’t on purpose I’m pretty sure. 

Now, I don’t know if The Iceberg was destined to collide with the BR island or if the cube explosion drew it towards the map but here’s my guess on what went down before that. I think there was a council, judging by The Ice Kings little conference room area with the table under the throne room. The Ice Elemental and Fire Elemental one day broke into an argument when the fire man was meeting with The Ice King and his entourage. This resulted in a fight that was short lived because The Ice King had his people nearby. Sacrificing everything to not witness his already perfect ice empire melt, he imprisoned the fire elemental deep in his dungeon, and then froze everything over, entering a hopefully eternal slumber. 

My guess with Sgt. Winter, Lynx, Powder and A.I.M is that they’re not Iceberg natives but instead go on expeditions to conquer new lands. They conquered the Iceberg while The Ice King was inactive but saw that it was drifting towards another island. So the Sargent sent a single A.I.M bot in a Stormwing to scout ahead on the BR Island. Another guess is that Lynx designs the AIMs and makes them. When the Iceberg collided with the island, she saw the remnants of the Carbide and Omega films and using her prowess in design, she made her own suit to aid the Expedition army. Powder probably does the same thing as AIMs but is there just Incase they make an error. Trog could be a remnant of The Ice Kings entourage that went mad. Zenith could be any old explorer who also came across the Iceberg.

The warmer climate of the Island wasn’t enough to melt Polar, but it was enough to reawaken The Fire King who slowly started to melt the huge mound of ice. The Ice King, in a last resort of effort after reawakening as well uses cube fragments from Loot combined with his own ability to spread ice and snow across the island, just as the cube spread its corruption around the island. However it is no use, and The Fire King is fully awoken. The Ice King, slumbering again as the spell took lots of his power is unaware of this as the former prisoner unshackles himself by sneaking into the castle. He then uses the energy he collected from the warm climate earlier to melt the snow The Ice King but on the island, restoring “balance”.

He goes into the desert and regains more of his former energy. What happens next is a mystery but here’s my guess. Before the cube explosion, it cracked then dropped a lot of its energy into the hole in Loot. We’ve been experiencing Earthquakes in game. My guess is whatever is a result of the energy that Kevin dropped into Loot is what is causing the Earthquakes. It may also be the Fire King trying to restore balance by disconnecting the Iceberg from the island. It may be a combination of these things and he’s melting the iceberg and the earthquakes because of the energy under loot will cause a massive tsunami that floods part of the map. I’m unsure, we’ll have to see

They feel more like chores you don't want to do, but have to anyways.","The Battle Pass used to be so much more endurable before as of the past few season. The introduction of stage challenges that do nothing but waste time, considering the fact that you can't even do multiple stages in a match is the most annoying, tedious thing ever. Not to mention the boring challenges that go with them, such as the Shooting Gallery and Time Trail challenges. Multi-step challenges that can only be done one per match have ruined the battle passes for me moving on thus far. The only interesting thing to do in this game thus far, if you can even consider that, is just doing challenges. The issue is that the formula for challenges recently just tires me out and makes me want to finish them even less.

Real challenges should be things like, ""Get a Win"", ""Get x Amount of Kills with Any Weapons"", etc. Something that is more rewarding to the player and encourages people to get wins. Let's be realistic, LTM's have only served as a way for people to do the certain amount of challenges they need to and then leave. Literally all I've seen people do, myself included. The truth is, challenges need some sort of revamp. They're getting far too boring and too chore-like for me to want to even try to finish this Battle Pass. I'm at Tier 85 and can easily get to 100 by finishing the challenges, but I just haven't felt the motivation because it's just running around the map doing meaningless objectives that they call '""challenges"", when in reality it's just run here and do this. That's not a challenge. Never has it been considered one, it's just tedious. Hopefully I have some people who agree with me on this, challenges just aren't interesting to me anymore.",FortNiteBR

OR a .44 Magnum (Rick from “The Walking Dead”) that’s take Heavy bullets (HIGH damage, slightly faster than Hand Cannon)

OR a Silenced M4 Benelli Shotgun (similar sound to “No Country for Old Men” motel scene. very unique, terrifying sound, powerful close range weapon)

OR Portable Electro-Magnetic Railgun PEMR (only Legendary, very rare, does 175 damage to body, 400 damage to Head, extremely long reload, slow &amp; loud charging mechanism before projectile leaves, cool animations) 🧐

In my opinion, it was perfectly balanced in the current state of the game, it was good, but not so good that it was OP. In DPS the Submachine Gun tops the Suppressed everytime (for the same rarity of SMG). The DPS for the suppressed are 198, 204, and 216. For the Submachine Gun it was 204, 216, and 228 (for the different rarities). 

    On top of that is the fire rate of the Submachine Gun, which was twelve bullets per second, compared to the Suppressed SMG, which is only shooting at 9 bullets per second. The only thing that is better about the Suppressed SMG is that it does more damage per shot, but if the Submachine Gun has a faster fire rate and higher DPS, then personally I find the damage per shot kind of insignificant. 

    I’m also the kind of person who likes a lower damage, faster firing SMG, and now that isn’t even really an option. The P90 is also another slow shooting SMG at 10 bullets per second. First they vaulted the tactical which was shooting at 13 bullets per second, and now the Submachine Gun, shooting at 12. I feel instead of the Submachine Gun being vaulted, they should’ve vaulted the P90. Now we have two slow shooting SMGs and no faster firing ones, the ones I prefer.

Furthermore we simply can’t edit as fast as pc player and also don’t have 35 different buttons that we can use as our binds. Then we also have to deal with an input delay with a controller (multiple ms). 
Im not saying these are all your faults and you’re responsible for this, but you could at least do separate lobbies for controller and M&amp;K, when there are so many disadvantages for controllers.

Recently I've been thinking about what it would be like if they added the other mode character classes to br, here is what i think it would be like 


The current defaults outfits would be changed to a helmet icon (representing soldiers) and 3 more default outfit options would be added, outlanders, ninjas, and constructors. They would each have 8 skin variants, 4 male and 4 female. Each with their own abilities


**Constructor: Useful for Building. stronger walls, faster building, less mats used per building built. Building with traps have more health.**


**Outlander: Useful for Farming. More pickaxe damage, faster pickaxe swing. more mats per building destroyed. More materials and ammo in chests and ammo boxes.**


**Ninjas: Useful for Mobility. Higher Jump/Double Jump, increased melee damage to opponents, faster run speed. Double jumping makes a loud sound but footsteps are harder to hear.**


**Soldiers: Useful for Weapons and Damage. longer range for throwables, slightly more damage with weapons to opponents.**


This would be fun to be able to try out different playstyles, if you're more of a shooting guy, use a soldier skin. If you dont do much but farm, use an outlander and help the constructor on the team build the walls to revive your ninja teammate who does nothing but jump around and get knocked every other minute.

It’s supposed to run at 30 FPS, but it’s more like 15 most of the time. The lag is unbelievable. Such a shitty gaming experience.  Still I’ve been playing for 265 hours. Feels like time wasted. 

I’d love to buy a new PC, but as a single dad I cannot simply afford it. I’ve been thinking about actually buying a PS4, but I feel like it’s too late in it’s life span. PS5 is most likely around the corner.

Pistol- Regular Damage increased from 23/24 to 25/27

Headshot Damage increased from 46/48 to 50/54

Vertical Recoil reduced by a third of its current

Suppressed Pistol-   Damage increased to 28/30

Headshot Damage increased from 52/56 to 56/60

Scoped AR- Damage increased from 23/24 to 25/26

Headshot Damage increased from 46/48 to 50/52

Thermal Scoped AR- Reduced vertical Recoil by 25%

Grenade launcher- I actually sometimes use dynamite over this, so I think a suitable buff would be the grenade explode after the second bounce or  4.5 seconds

Now you can counter it but it's just not easy try to build out deagled down. Back in the same spot. It's just too hard to fight especially since build health has been nerfed. Now this is just a suggestion and before you call it stupid or that I'm just bad I can assure you I'm not and maybe this doesn't happen to you but when you play pop ups a lot and go against PC players while on console it can become much more difficult to play against.

I like Apex, I’ve learned the game and have played enough to get a good feel for it and understand the good and the bad parts of it. It really is a good game, but so was Blackout and so was Pubg. Early 2018 it was all Pubg Vs Fort. Now I hear nothing from Pubg, I mean yea I know its not dead but I just don’t hear much about it anymore. Same thing with Blackout, everyone was anticipating it and on release streamers were all over it and it had all this hype, but a month or so later the hype for it was gone and everyone was back on Fortnite. Apex is fresh and has a unique style to it and right now streamers are all over it.


In my opinion, I don’t think that is going to last very long. Mainly because Fortnite knows how to stay fresh by switching things up a good amount although yea the community gets a bit salty over certain changes, but sometimes they’re good. They have also partnered with big names like the NFL and Marvel. They held a freakin live concert with Marshmello. Drake was playing for a bit. They also have a story behind all the map changes and have a lot of cool little easter eggs. They’re on every platform and capable of crossplay. Fortnite loses its fire for a bit and allows another BR to have the spotlight which Apex has right now but I think with the start of Season 8, they’re going to introduce some wild shit and have everyone flock right back. Other BR’s would really have to step it up to have a good hold on that #1 spot.",FortNiteBR

1: remove the X-4 stormwing and replace it with a speed jet. Carries 4 people in separate pods in the plane. Has no turret. Brings you for a “rifty ride!” When you use the boost it teleports you 125 meters in the direction you are facing OR when you use the boost you can do some sort of phase shift But can be used in short bursts.

2. Vault rocket launchers and replace them with a three use mounted guided missile.

	3. Reduce the maximum amount of materials to 700 wood 500 stone and 300 metal. OR add a cooldown system to stop excessive building and build fights. For every 200 materials you spend you must wait 5 seconds before building again.

4. Nerf the hand cannon to either 5 shots but the same damage to players and structure OR a faster fire rate to where you can shoot it in rapid succession but only does 75/78 damage to structures rather than 150/157 but no damage fall off to players.

5. Give shopping carts and ATKs 100% spawn rate and leave the quadcrasher , driftboard and speed jet to 50%

6. Unvault the drum gun but have a mag size of 40 and 24/25 damage. Unvault  the bolt action sniper rifle and heavy shotgun.

7.Unvault shockwave grenades, grappler and bouncers.

8.Allow the ability to upgrade materials to be stronger like the way you can do it in save the world.

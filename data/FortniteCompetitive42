Since kills are very important and can reward you points/ shield which can cost you qualifiers. 

This will still reward players who get their kill stolen by the storm
Players leaving the game early to deny points will be useless.
Players who jump off a cliff/buildings after losing the 50/50 chest spawn location. (happens way too often)
This can also be used so you get rewarded when you use impulse to kill a person using the storm.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method**

I'm sure I will get criticized for this, but I just wanted to get a model that will give a rough idea. Note - it is very difficult (actually impossible) to give a perfect model for a partial dataset, therefore, no matter what the method is, it will be inaccurate in some way. I could make assumptions, like it's exponential, or if we binned the data it would be a normal distribution, but none of this is necessarily true. 

What I did was tried several different curves, including Guassian, Exponential, Lorentzian, Power Law and Polynomial to find which one had the lowest error, and gave a reasonable asymptotic limit. The one I went with was a power law. The equation is simply ""y = y0 + Ax\^pow"". I then made the assumption that roughly a million players scored 5 or more points. The closer we get to 5 points, the more inaccurate my model is, so I will only be providing you with numbers down to 15 points, as I think anything lower is just a guess by me, and is highly inaccurate. 

For percentages, I'm assuming 10 million competed, so please don't trust this number, it's just meant to be my best guess based on the number of monthly Fortnite players, and my guess as to what percentage of those actually played in the tournament. The number you should trust the most the actual rank. If anybody has a better estimate for the total participants, please let me know and I'll update!

This post is meant to garner a discussion, it's not a ""who's right / who's wrong"" argument - so feel free to post your opinions or your disagreements. THERE IS NO TLDR, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts:

1. Keep the farm rate at 40%, but increase the cap to 700
2. Reduce rocket cap to 6 (as of now, with a mat cap of 500 why would the rockets you can hold also not get a cap?)
3. Reduce smg damage to builds
4. Vault Double Barrel
5. Vault Quad Launcher
6. Vault Port o Fort(ress)
7. Vault Turret
8. Bring back Bounce pads
9. Change Launch pads to blue rarity
10. Move game changing weapons like Rockets, Heavy Snipers, Shockwave grenades, Rift to Go and Grapplers to care packages ONLY
   1. Every time a care package spawns, it needs to be shown on the mini map as a marker - allowing all players an equal chance at finding them
11. Increase player movement speeds by a small amount (1.15?) enough that will allow a legitimate strafing skill gap in close quarter combat

&amp;#x200B;

As a former competitive Halo 3 player,  I have to say that their system was pretty much the best I've seen out of any game. They had increased movement speed, higher jumping and timed power weapons at set locations. Obviously the last part isn't possible for BR, but I think the power weapons being moved to care packages it becomes a bit more balanced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Halo 3 also had the best ranked system imo, where you were put at 1-50. If you were a 42, you'd play other people around that level, give or take a rank or two to ensure fast loading times. We found very quickly this weekend that when matched up with people of similar skill, that it made for very fun and competitive games. In order to rank up to 43, you'd have to win multiple games as a rank 42. Obviously, this isn't viable for Fortnite, but I think with a few tweaks it could work. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the point system remained similar, we could have a point threshold to rank up. You must reach ""x"" amount of points in ""x"" games to reach the next rank. For the sake of the example, let's say you need AT LEAST 15 points in 3 games to rank up. You need AT LEAST 10 points in 3 games to remain at your rank. Anything under 10 points in 3 games and you lose a rank. 

For points:

* 1 point per kill
* 1 point for a top 10 placement
* 1 point for top 5
* 1 point for top 3
* 3 points for winning

This way, if you're winning games with 10 kills you're not capped at the same rate as if you won with 7 kills. You'd essentially have to average 5 points / game to rank up, which could come from getting 5 kills / game or getting 1 kill with a top 3 placement. 

&amp;#x200B;

There would have to be fixes to fall damage / suicides / storm kills / leaving games - all things that have been recommended on this sub before. If you do damage to a player while they're falling, you should get the kill when they hit the environment. If a player leaves the match early, they should receive a penalty of some sort and their character model should remain in game for \~30 seconds. If you do damage to a player and they die in the storm, you should receive that kill. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously there would be a lot to work out, but I think this would create a fantastic ranked system where you're consistently getting matched up with players of your caliber, with opportunities to get to the next level. It'll show you how close / far away you really are from the top tier players as well.

While some things need tweaking (point system, match limit, in-game items), it seems like a lot of sour grapes from entitled/cocky players and fans. Just because you or your favorite pro didn't qualify...doesn't mean EPIC should throw the baby out with the bath water.

Dare I say, the Winter Royale has been the most fair and competitive Fortnite tournament so far. There is skill based match making, no free invites, and the format allows for both passive and aggressive playstyles.

Some pros got baited into over-valuing themselves...when in reality they have a few problems that left them under-prepared for this past weekend.

.1. Open qualifiers is the most fair thing right now, in a game with such a young and under-developed pro scene. I saw some people whine and complain that there should be different qualifiers for pros. Lol what?

So you can skate by easily into the finals in servers with silly battle etiquette rules? Someone even told me that those pub stomp Solo Showdowns should be used for qualifying unknown players. Which makes zero sense.

You or your favorite streamer used to be an unknown too. Its only fair that everyone is on an even playing field and entry level with a game still young in its competitive life.

2. Getting in the pro-cord is based on rules set in place by a bunch of youngsters...which leads to drama, politics and people needing to sometimes kiss ass to remain in the discord server

3. Oh, youre mad about getting hot dropped? Well guess what....EPIC is never going back to the 3k mats, super passive play, end-game mazes with heal offs, where kills didn't matter as much. That brand of competitive fortnite is dead. 

This is Battle Royale...learn to deal with being shot at any time. So what if a guy is pushing you with the storm about to close. Maybe he needs to gain shield for killing you, and set himself up better for end-game by taking your loot.

A BR that lets you build and break structures? Fuck yeah. As a casual I liked the game, but the better I got I started to notice the problems with this game and it's mechanics. I started to get frustrated with the RNG and Epic completely ignoring the Competitive community. Them turning themselves so much towards casual players who play 50v50 for 30 minutes and leave the game for days really started to frustrate me, so I put myself in comp. environments. I played scrims, customs, snipes, etc. It was fun and challenging for some time, and then I got annoyed with it and the stupid, unbalanced changes and additions that Epic liked so much. (Original P90, Clinger box spam, 25% splode through structure DMG, original Double Barrel, material nerfs and lowering, turrets and so much more) Then they removed the Glider Redeploy feature. I was fucking mad. Sure, some people hated it, and I can understand, but you can't deny it made the game much more dynamic and fast paced. Now that I'm used to the mechanic being removed, the game seems and feels different. It has become so dull and pointless to play. All I do nowadays is grind out Solo wins that are useless aswell.

This tournament was an opportunity for a lot of people to make their dreams come true. That's fair and I don't disagree with that. In fact, I think most pros wouldn't disagree with that (Although most people who are good enough to go pro are grinding duos league in FNPL).

I think the *main* thing most pros are upset about is **the differentiation between the winter royale qualifiers and the winter royale finals, not RNG** (It's a BR, there will be RNG in every game). 

In the qualifiers, there was a time limit *but* in the finals there will be a game limit. Why is that not seen as a problem for most people?

There is no way to really tell who is going to do well in the finals when, in the qualifiers, 20-30% of the lobby is dying before the first zone closes. Very few people would drop tilted if there was a game limit. Which is exactly what's going to happen in the finals. 

I get that there are issues with having a game limit and SBMM, and I'm very open willing to opinions on it. But suggesting that the pros are ""bitching"" for no reason or that some pros are ""gatekeeping"" or that they're ""scared"" is just kinda unfair to them. There are some pros that qualified for the tournament (Chap, Bizzle, etc) who legitimately had problems with how it was set up.

The question is, why even have scrims at that point? We saw in the last Skirmish how Nickmercs and Aydan roflstomped a ton of ""pros"" who scrimmed because the pros weren't used to the early game aggression. I can guarantee that if Nickmercs/Aydan scrimmed with fake names, they would get banned almost instantly for being too aggressive in the early game. Same with that Razzer00 guy. He constantly bans people from scrims because they storm push, and it turns out that he didn't even qualify for the Winter Skirmish. Newsflash: in REAL tournaments, people are going to be aggressive. They're going to hold you out of storm. They're going to drop wherever they want. 

Playing 1000 scrim games to practice for end game won't matter in REAL tournaments if you can't even make it to end game because you banned everyone who killed you early game lol. ",FortniteCompetitive

There's definitely a discussion to be had if 50 health/shield is the optimal choice, but for now, would anyone disagree with Epic adding it in the regular modes? Right now? If not, why?

I'd really like to test this out (like we did with glider) and see how it changes the game. Not permanently, yet, but if people like it or not.

What's obvious to me is that it's going to generally make people harder to kill later in the game, cause of the extra shields, which might be a bad thing in terms of more 3rd partying etc,. but it might also be a good thing overall because you'll have less games where you didn't have a chance at all because of bad loot.

- Hamlinz and DAE are content creators NOT pros. This doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be able to compete in future Fortnite tournament, but as the situation is now Hamlinz and Dae is representing TSM’s pro roster in the most embarrassing way, not even trying to qualify for the winter royale, staying home to stream instead of competing at pax and twitchcon, not scriming and generally not even trying to improve.

- We already knew that Cowboy and Kaysid can compete on the highest level, but this weekend has shown us that all the scrims Myth has grinded is finally showing and I hope he will only get better with time. 

- TSM’s roster still isn’t complete. In my opinion TSM still needs to sign one or two players. With players like symfuhny, Zoof, blind and zexrow being free agents they need to at least put in an offer.

TL;DR
Hamlinz and DAE are content creator NOT pros. The TSM roaster is able to compete on the highest level but still needs to sign at least one of the many top tier free agents such as Zexrow, Sumfuhny, Zoof and blind

Also, for splodes, i have something on my mind that i dont know if it would work , but hear me out: rpgs, grenade launchers and quad launchers only exist in its gold form, and they could only be obtainable trough vendys and supply drops (maybe increase the drop rate of them on supply drops or increase the number of supply drops)

Maybe all gold weapons should be exclusive to supply drops and vendys, idk

However, the issue with this is that a third partier benefits way too much. Imagine you spend a minute trying to kill someone, and someone else comes and puts in 1 AK bullet and steals your kill. You have 100 mats left and 60 health whilst the guy near you just received a ton of health and mats with little to no risk and it surely means you're now screwed.


However, if there was health/mat rewards that correlates to the damage we do to a player, I feel like that is a much more fair and balanced solution. Lets say we receive 40% of health/mats back as a proportion of damage dealt (just an example). You do 200 damage to a player and receive back 80 health and 40 of each type of material (maybe more/less it doesnt matter). With this change, in a situation where you deal 100 damage and a third partier steals your kill with 30 damage, you're receiving much more of a reward and promotes actual fighting rather than editing a hole in your window and picking off people from afar).

Downsides? Well it'd be hard to monitor what exactly counts as an engagement. Maybe if a player doesn't do damage to another player for say 30 seconds that window resets. That way, if a player at the start of a game gets away, the opposing player isnt randomly rewarded 10 mins later after said player dies. Thoughts?",FortniteCompetitive

Winter Royale was overall good but I watched a lot of pros consistently run out of mats and also a lot of players reach the point max getting 18-20 kill games. Showing that the kill incentive of 50 hp worked but was useless after hitting the hp cap and that the 7 kill point was flawed, so I think each kill should activate a scorestreak or 3 kills should activate one of your choice. This kind if mechanic is used in save the world with gadgets for example a supply drop, which is shown below it allows players to spawn in a supply crate with mats and ammo that is where the low mat versa high kill situation fits in as you have kills you have probably spent lots of mats. It could even reduce rng upping the rarity of one weapon of your choice at a certain kill streak or stage, as i saw many pros do well with little loot or bad loot but not be able to survive end game.

I see Nickmercs and Aydan the two most known console players and I see their strengths to name a few, I see that aydan can do whole variety of things and nick is a specialist at aiming. I don't want to type up a storm but let's get a list going of a few things top players do that is great. Big or small. 

One less noticable thing aydan does is even if he has low health and a bit of heals instead of running off and panicking to take them he gauges the situation and still takes shots at ppl in some cases which I think is sort of a BLUFF to get ppl to not push him hard because they have the impression hes weak and conscious that hes about to die. It's a great way to keep ppl to back off and then he can pop those minis. I've seen him do this ",FortniteCompetitive

In the first one he came 2nd 3 times (running out of materials twice) and in the second one in the last game he missed the 29 points by 1 kills (having a player back out of the game early on).

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post but I just think SypherPk deserves a lot of credit for his performance. 

Also, some suggestions are to let players' bodies stay in the game after backing out and increasing the mat cap slightly (maybe 700).

Despite there being claims about Epic only inviting people with clout it is obvious that anyone that grinds their way up to the pro discord and makes a name for themselves can easily be invited. Most of the players that are in these skirmishes are pro cord players and that's how it should be. Going through FNPL ranks all the way to the top takes a lot more skill than a 2-day qualifier filled with RNG and a questionable format that no one has played before. Trust me, I am not just salty about not qualifying because even if I did I'm not eligible to play due to my age. Also, I myself grinded FNPL and the StepOne scrim server for months before joining the pro cord and I can tell you all these names that you guys see now such as ZexRow and others started off in StepOne (The scrim server that was the gateway to pro before FNPL). I think a great system for the skirmish would be to have 50 guaranteed spots for players that have already proved themselves or are signed to big orgs as a comp player and then have the 50 other spots for people that Epic sees doing well or coming up in the pro discord. Then those 50 players can prove themselves and replace people that have guaranteed spots but are not doing well. Ex: If a player that doesn't have a guaranteed spot gets a very high placing or wins the Skirmish he replaces one of the guaranteed players who has placed 90-100th or something like that. It would reward consistency, bring in new competition, and make the game as competitive as possible by only inviting top tier players.",FortniteCompetitive

if you could actually consistently replace peoples walls/floors on their 1x1 with pickaxe+turbo build then the entire meta would be more skill-based and less RNG.

splodes should just be removed though, it doesn't counter 1x1 turtling, any good player will out-build splodes. literally the only thing splodes do is eat hundreds of mats from an unlucky player and gives the player a get out of jail free card when they lose high ground. ",FortniteCompetitive

So here's a little backstory. I started playing this game really early ""season 0"" if you will  i played so much but i wasn't very good. Fast forward to season 3 where i basically quit the game for about a month. I come back and at the start of s4 start playing so much. I feltl like i was really improving and was excited to play and improve everyday. I got about 60 wins that season compared to my 9 lifetime wins before that. S5 rolls around and it's summer so i played even more i got my season high of wins in 100+ and felt super confident in pubs. Now to s6 i start trying some scrims first FNML and then FNPL pc by using a mouse to que up. This was a really good experience as it really boosted my confidence but for the last month i have beej doing really bad.



I have very few wins. My KD is down and so is my win % i still play 2-3 hours every day and over 5 hours on the weekends so it's really demoralizing as a player and i feel like im on the verge of quitting. Is there anyone willing to help me with tips or maybe tutor me in game? (Im eu) ",FortniteCompetitive

My first two sessions I got 12 and 14 points(26 in pop-up cup in under 4 hours, only one session). I played for placement and got a point for elimination once(my second to last point for 14 during the second session). There are players more skilled than me who would perform much better point wise if they altered their game style a bit, but it’s all about what’s right for you and what makes you comfortable. 

My third session was awesome. I got two VRs my first three games and was at 11 points within an hour. That’s where I ran into the heavy hitters for a few games. My fourth game I was in a lobby with Liquid Vivid(I finished 20th) and some other player who sent me back to the lobby within the first 10 seconds of engagement. One of my games had 11 people for two moving zones where I was tunneling/editing three walls off the ground, surrounded, when usually bodies would’ve dropped. Securing that 10th place spot during that chaos was a win to me and after watching the skirmishes, playing in that environment was almost a dream. Thanks again Epic. 

The times I did die though were to great players or the storm, no dying to players that I should have defeated. I probably got into 3-5 build battles my third session and that was usually for height. If I wasn’t able to secure height I would edit through my builds and disengage if I needed to lose my opponent so I could secure a point. I’m able to keep up with building but when it comes to combat and execution, PC players who know what they’re doing just seem to move a bit more quicker than console players in my opinion.

My basic game plan was to play for the win and get elims on late game rotations. Early circles I would ride the edge, then late game I would push for the center. Late game third parties are more apparent so players are less likely to engage which is why I’ll put myself in the center of the circle late game. Rotating edge late game you can run into a lot of players and end up in clusterfucks. It’s something I’ve noticed from watching pros and even in my own game play from scrimming as well as competing yesterday.  5 points was more important to me than engaging before 10th place, when I knew I had a better chance at that, than eliminating 7 players for three points. Once my cqc skills improve to where I’m comfortable with I’ll start being a little aggressive as there were too many times I tagged players during rotations but didn’t want to take the risk of losing the engagement. 

I started playing Fortnite (on my own account)season 5 and it’s my first shooter game, console player as well. So, my aim is really weak and it’s something I’ve put a lot of emphasis on this past week and will focus on for as long as I play these type of games. My cqc skills is lacking as every fight prior to this week would turn into a crouch/jumping match. Add that with bad aim you can see where the .5 k/d comes from. I just love the strategic side of the game, the things you can do with building, rotating, and especially end game when you have to tunnel and turtle quickly. I’ve been plugging in my mouse to scrim through FNPL for the past month just out of awe from watching the skirmishes. I play for placement in those scrims and usually end up 2nd or 1st with a few to no elims.

I’m also looking for a mentor to 1v1 often in playground and also someone on my skill level/play style to play duos with. 

TL;DR I’m an above average bot who got 16 points. ",FortniteCompetitive

Some of PC players are like gods and they will for sure make good controller players like bots and noobs just because they can :  ""turn faster"" ( they have a higher sensitivity than console player max is = 10 ) , ""edit faster"" ( epic did a great job til now for console when they reduced the edit time but still needs some improvements of editing's sensitivity  ) + "" flickshots"" + "" insta swap between weapons"", ""making their camera stable""  in the middle all the time ( do you know how hard it is to keep your camera stable in the middle of the fight/building when your sensitivity is higher than 9 ( i use 10x/10y ) , ""moving/controlling the mouse"" with their hand not like controller player when he needs to do that only with one finger + ""easy aim"" (tracking)....etc

im not bitching here as some of you may say that, but all we want is a fair challenge against players who has the same advantage/disatvantage. 

We ""know"" exactly pc players will be dominating the tournaments forever i have no doubt in that. ( Wake me up when controller players win 2 tournament in a row against pc players ) 

I wish you could understand how it feels when you get rekt everytime by a god/very good pc players.

Epic created so many tournaments right , so how many controller player won the tournament against pc players , you may say 1 or 2 max in total of more than 20 tournaments at least in the past few months. 

How many controller player was participating in skirmish ( 4/6 max players in a lobby with 96/94 pc players ) and they got rekt by god pc players that are in the same lobby with them. 


My question is : why would we compete against players (pc/k&amp;m) who have already huge advantage on controller players and they keep all the time winning the tournaments.

( my respect to all pc/controller/mobile players )
But it doesnt feel right when you put mobile players againt controller players in the same lobby and expect mobile players to dominate the tournaments. Its litteraly unfair. And its the same thing for controller/ k&amp;m players ... it will never be fair.

Could epic make tournament for different type of device ( mobile/console/pc ) !!!

I feel it reduces the early game RNG since living or dying doesn't highly depend on shield RNG from looting and it rewards aggressive play in a balanced way I feel.

I can land risky get 3 quick kills off the bat and sure I'll take some damage but instead of being left with 20 HP after the 3rd kill and getting killed by the 4th guy practically sneezing on me who by the way was lucky enough to be left alone in a small area to loot and get shields etc..

Same situation with the mechanic would leave me around a good 100+ and ready to fight instead of having 99% chance of getting eliminated by what could be a bad player. I feel it rewards the better players more since their consistency is high and doesn't come down to some bad luck or 3rd party which is very common now people are much better at the game and know it's the best way to play since your hardly taking damage and can have more success in the later game.

I feel this would be a way better test to do when compared to something like glider redeployment which was tested for 2 weeks.

Look forward to hearing your thoughts on the subject.

TL;DR I Want the 50Hp/Shield per elim added to the main modes for at the very least testing.",FortniteCompetitive

The grey AR is a close second.  
For obvious reasons you don't want to get a grey burst early-on and when you drop to a crowded area as this will severely cripple you and put you at a huge disadvantage already.  


There has always been a ""worst weapon of the game"" and I feel like right now it might just be the grey burst even though the six-shooter and the grey pistol are still terrible as well. But at least their rate is not nearly as high as the grey burst which you'll often find 4 of them looting 2 chests and finding 3 floor loot.  


I understand RNG and I think it's an essential part of the game, even though it is sometimes frustrating, it's a core mechanic and as long as the floor/chest loot system exists there is nothing that can be done to prevent the fact that sometimes you'll have a sniper rifle and your opponent a blue smg and they'll erase you without it being a fair fight at all.  
But one of the worst weapon of the game and especially for early-game having such a high rate, that's a big no.   


Actually I think chests should NOT have grey weapons at all in the first place. You can't see what you're going for when you go for a chest so lets reduce the chances of having a bad surprise, also going for chests often requires better landing and knowledge in general. And, since there are way less chests spawn than floor loot, I think it makes sense that chests contain better weapons.

Although it is inevitable, something should be done to reduce the chance the classic scenario happening, where you land better than some guy, you open a chest, find a grey burst, and they just missed completely their landing, dropped on the floor, found a green pump, engage you at close range, RIP (Of course it's still possible to outplay them, it's just they have like 80-20 advantage.  
The in-game tips even tell to go for chests as they often have nice loots well that is not true right now and this needs to be adressed imo.",FortniteCompetitive

(Yes it’s that small) With a cheap ass mouse. I have cramped desk room and my monitor doesn’t even push back toward the back of my desk because there’s some cubbies installed towards the top. 

All that bs aside. That means im not good mechanically due to lack of practice, natural skill, and peripheral/hardware limitation. I watch a lot of scrims and play in a decent amount. (To any regular scrimmer that would equate to me play a low amount of scrims.) I watch a lot of pros and copy their movements/decision making. But that SHOULD not be enough for me to reach 25 points. I think it’s due to a flawed format. I know I’m not at the best of my ability yet and the fact I got close is concerning. Some of you may question why I’d even make this post, but in a tournament the best of the best should compete against each other and I shouldn’t even be in the conversation.

Zoof responded to a guy who was talking about how if tsm picked up zoof, that TSM would have picked up 2/4 people in the clan that zoof made the pro Cord with (cowboy and zoof). Kaysid then chimes in and says that he was a part of that team too and that having all three on the same ORG again would be really sick. I think with the way zoof answered the statement, I think that he is hinting the fact that he may also be joining TsM.

I will get shot to near death and not get pushed nowadays, allowing me to heal to full (or not, my rng trash i usually have no heals lul) 

It's kind of pathetic and ruins the fun for me. Take out your damn guns people! Even if your spam building gets you the kill on me (or rather, phasing through and shooting through my walls, which happens all the time now. Never did before this season...) all that accomplishes is letting some third party shoot you down and get the kill on you! Or the fight stalls and the same thing happens, getting them 2 kills! Or I drop down and kill you with fall damage, and then I have no mats anymore and the same third party kills me either way!

Spam building does no favors for anyone but the thirdparty, stop it...

speaking of which, why does that always happen since season 5? I don't recall much third party in season 3 and 4. of course it did happen but not every game like now, and even then, folks didn't rely on that

I always see aggresive players like me with lots of kills lose to campers/third party warriors with 0-2 kills. I get the game is about surviving, not killing, but c'mon it's not even FUN to win if you don't have kills... How do people find hiding for 20 minutes fun? 

And why do we lose to these people? The new storm circle system is dumb, escape items are WAY too much now, and third party too strong. 

Also I always have enemies phase through my wall, or shoot through my wall and ramp. This doesn't happne with my floor or pyramids. This didnt happen in prior seasons.

I am nowhere close to the level of top players, but found myself getting around the same amount of points as them. I have noticed that most pro players are getting between 23-31, but are getting really tilted by a couple of things. Specifically, mat count.

My thoughts:
I’m noticing that a lot of top players, such as Tfue and Poach, are complaining about not having enough mats late game. They constantly are dying while having zero mats, but there is a reason for that which they could easy fix. One, is not always trying to go for high ground late game. I watched poach constantly go for high ground late game and waste 700-800 mats while doing so. This isn’t scrims, high ground is not important enough to waste all your mats. Even in mid game fights, getting into build fights is not worth it, because even if you kill the guy, the mats you will recoup will be slim to none. Another thing I have noticed, is players using all their wood up first. Since everybody is using wood in fights, when you eventually kill the player, you get no wood from them, and because you already have max brick and max metal, you gain no mats from them.

I am only used to using shift to run, WASD and E and T and G. I am a fast editor and builder.

(in my opinion)

\*Remove\*

* Heavy AR - too much damage and is way to accurate.
* Either the Scoped AR or the Thermal Scoped - both serve the same purpose, you only need 1.
* Compact SMG - way to spammy and is way to accurate while hip firing, also requires 0 skill to use.
* Double Barrel - requires a minimum of half a brain cell to use, and relies on RNG and barrel stuffing.
* Heavy Shotgun - buff both the pump and the tac, and remove the heavy to reduce RNG.
* Heavy Sniper - 150 damage to body seems unfair especially since the heavy is easier to use than a bolt.
* Purple RPG - RPGs should be supply drops only.
* Blue and Purple Grenade launcher- same reason as the RPG.
* Quad Launcher - i shouldn't have to explain this.
* Dynamite - its just C4 the sequel, get rid of it.
* Port-a-Fort/Fortress - useless and just caters to brainlets.
* Grappler - gives you high ground without having to do anything for it.
* Rift-to-go - remove it but add more rifts in the map so that rotations are still quick, but you can't just back out of a fight
* Chiller - Useless
* Turret - Why is this even in the game???
* Balloon - Useless
* Bush - Useless

\*Replace or Rework\*

* Gold and Purple AR should replaced by the silenced one because the bloom punishes spraying and rewards accuracy.
* Grey, green and blue AR should have the same bloom mechanics as the suppressed scar (but obviously less powerful).
* Burst AR's are too weak they need to be reworked.
* Minigun should have a overheat similar to the turrets, so there is at least something for noobs to use.
* normal SMG should replaced by the suppressed SMG because it rewards aim instead of just spraying
* replace the regular pistols with the suppressed pistol because the normal pistols are too weak.
* Six Shooter doesn't do enough damage, just buff from like 38 to 40 (purple) 36 to 38 (Blue) 34 to 36 (green
* buff the pump(green) 80 to 90 and (blue) 85 to 95.
* buff the Tac(grey) 67 to 70 (green) 70 to 73 (blue) 74 to 76
* make RPGs and Grenade Launchers supply drop only.
* make Spike Traps' hitbox reach the other side but make it only do 125 or 100.
* replace the shockwave with impulses (impulses at least punish you by making you take fall damage, if you tried to launch yourself of a mountain.)

Again this is just my opinion",FortniteCompetitive

Lets say you have a game of chess with an equally worthy opponent. Your chances to win are 50% since you are equals. Well lets say you have 100 players who  are all equal with a certain amount of RNG. Who is gonna win? this is very random and not predictable. You can judge for yourself and also do the math.

&amp;#x200B;

 However this essentially simple math and there wont be a significant difference between certain pros or overall. every player has a chance of 1/100 to win in a match, when everyone is equal(comp), so there is no real competition. Essentially it's just luck who wins with a certain percentage to win(minimal).

Though there's 1 major problem. The problem is the time window. I don't know about you guys but 6x 3 hours (with resets) is honestly way too little time to rank players. 



I think this shows us why need ranked or 24/7 SBMM gamemode that doesn't reset our rank but rather gives us an elo system. If we got this it would be so much easier to differentiate the good players from the great players as a point system in a 3 hour window can lead to flukes really easy. We don't even need a fully fledged ranked mode Epic. Just for next season throw the winter royale format on solos and duos. Give us a little tab for ranked and give us an mmr system that goes up and down based on your preformance. It can have some errors but at least give us a beta ranked mode.


That's all. Very positive about this overall",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

95% of players burn through their wood first. This means when they die, they often drop no wood, but will drop brick and metal, which makes wood a more valuable resource.

&amp;#x200B;

This is assuming most players in the tournament will have close to max mats going into end game, which they usually do.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say you get in a build battle with someone, or are rotating with someone, both of you use 500 wood each then you kill him. You now have no wood and none to loot. If you had used your 500 brick instead of wood, you would now be looting his brick and still be on max 500/500/500.",FortniteCompetitive

Certain pros will moan about this and the issues with the current state of the game but it has been by far the most fair way to qualify for any tournament so far; leaps and bounds better than the random cherry picking of pros Epic has done up until this point.

Players like ZexRow are proving that the cream rises to the top, and I think for a lot of pro players who have coasted along in discords etc this will be a humbling experience.

This isn't a perfect system, but it is so refreshing to just let players play however they want; not having to adhere to any certain self-imposed rules or etiquette on where to drop and certain play styles to conform to.

But that doesn't mean that it's right; Fortnite is a stickler when it comes to keybindings - if you have less than optimal keybinds then you're in a worse position than others which you do not want to be.

So, if you're using the WASD key setup for movement, you generally:
- Have your index finger on D.

- Have your middle finger on W/S

- Have your ring finger on A

- Have your thumb on space

- Have your pinky on Shift/Capslock

Generally, you'll not use your pinky finger too much and it becomes ineffective because of how limited it is. So, if you move all of your keybinds over one to the right,your pinky finger instantly now has access to:
- Z, A and Q though I would likely use my ring finger for Q
- Capslock Shift and Tab (easily)
- The key next to Shift ( \ )
- Possibly X with a stretch

That's just for the one finger, meaning you can have many more keybinds in that entire area of the keyboard for use by the redundant finger. So, why not switch and have more keybind possibilities?",FortniteCompetitive

2. BEFORE the start of each game: publish/upload an encrypted file that contains a list with the values for all chest spawn positions, including whether the chest spawned and with the content.

I think with these two simple mechanisms, it is easy to prove that epic is not give advantage / disadvantage to some players/streamers, and that we have the same rng for everybody.

It is an accessory you may add to a ps4 or xbox controller that gives you 2 additional inputs (paddles) on your controller that can be bound to any button. I have seen so many people complaining, reviewing or raving about Scuf, Aim, battle beaver; you name it. Here is my main issue when dealing with these custom controllers....

&amp;#x200B;

1. Many of these custom controllers are well over $150 and can approach $250 at max. Not only is this price absolutely ridiculous, but you are paying for one of the biggest price gouges in modern gaming history. The FPS strike pack is $39.99 and I got mine on sale for 30 USD.  None of the components in these custom controllers justify the price (mainly looking at you SCUF). Cheap plastic and simple electronic works do not cost 1/10 of what they sell for.
2. Inconsistencies with custom controllers: this is mainly an issue with SCUF as you may have heard their recent Vantage has faced many complaints because their hardware and software is failing... randomly disconnects, huge deadzones etc. This is a huge problem for competitive gaming because no one wants to worry about their input device failing them halfway through a tournament with money on the line. 

Bottom line: If you own a ps4 and are considering a custom controller because you want to be able to jump and or build without taking your thumb off of the analog stick, I highly recommend going with the strike pack and some thumb grips. Not only is it a cheaper option, but it is BETTER. If you own an xbox then my recommendation is immediately going to be the xbox elite controller. It is hands down the best competitive gaming controller ever released and the price constitutes the quality. But, if you wish to save money then I recommend the strike pack. Please stop shelling away your money to these greedy companies. Invest in a low latency gaming monitor, stream set up...anything other than these terrible high priced custom controllers. I feel for all the 10-12 year olds that are gonna be asking for the new SCUF Vantage because they wanna play like ninja. These companies are destructive to the console gaming community and allow for more companies to gouge prices. The FPS strike pack can do what ever these companies claim their controllers can plus more. Let me know what you guys think ",FortniteCompetitive

(Even after the recent benefits)

I have been practicing more and more since the end of season 2 when I began to take the game seriously.

Here are my strategies.

--- Drop Dusty Divot
This is my drop spot and is in or next to the first zone all the time. I have found my perfect spots to land perfectly and know my routes flawlessly. I am able to wipe Dusty Divot 90% of the time and usually only 1-3 other players drop in the divot with another 1-2 at Diner. 

I get full shield and about 1700 mats from mushrooms, trees, and the fences around the joint.

--- Get to the outside edge of the zone
This is a strategy that I've always used and is great for knowing where the opponents are. I am usually able to pick off a few kills looking into the hotspots in the second and third zone.

---Wait
Once it comes down to about 5-10 people left ( in the tourney who knows what zone it could be in) I keep low ground because I am a low ground master wish a pump, I know, A PUMP. I swear I never miss. I like to connect to others build when they are up top because it normally puts them in a tough spot to either focus me or try to stay high and safe. 

By staying low at the end, many people besides those you are right next to do not know where you are.  And I'm able to take top 3 with 5+ kills

Once again I do not expect anything from the tournament but I'll be happy to give it a go. Let me know what y'all are planning!",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

1. Terrible server performance with lag spikes and upload/download packet loss. Players are often times jittery and the movement is horrible. 
2. Sometimes when your structure gets exploded you get teleport'd somewhere in an instant without the fall animation being smooth.
3. Turrets are in the game and the hit-box is just terrible if you're facing the guy that spams you
4. Bugs within building where your first piece will not be built under specific circumstances
5. Bugs when swap and try to shoot with shotgun and it's not doing so
6. Announcing it 5 days prior to the event

So, what they're trying to do is similar to hosting the UEFA Champions League Final on a stadium that has barely any grass on it and with only one referee. Also, mark my words they will change at least one core mechanic or add something new while the tourney is live and will spoil everything up for everyone. I understand that it's their choice what are they going to host and when, but you can't just do it for the sake of it. It's not human and definitely not respectful toward the players. It's our money that support Epic Games and make events like this one possible and we deserve at least a decent and playable game.",FortniteCompetitive

We have the heavy sniper. Powerful sniper that can shoot down builds and do massive damage

When Winter Royale was announced, I felt that excitement once again. Then I did the math. 400 from NA and EU combined will progress to the finals. Out of 120+ million player base. For a player like myself, with a 3KD and 15% WR, this event is just as meaningless as the rest. I may do a single time slot, just for fun. I may even drop 30 points. But I don't stand a chance. Any exciting event for the likes of Tfue, Nate Hill, and other up and coming 10KD streamers. I'm genuinely happy for the undiscovereds that are about to pop off tomorrow. To make a name for themselves for the first time ever. But for players like me, this changes nothing. Just another meaningless event. 

When can we get something that feels like it matters? A ranked queue. A shop with exclusive cosmetics where pins be spent. Anything to keep us playing. I broke 1000 wins last night. And I'm bored AF. I've resorted to scrims and snipes to have fun. But what will Epic provide us to some appreciation for the year we've put into their game? For the 100s of millions we've spent? So fa - nothing.

Copying a pro players bind and constantly swapping your settings in hopes of it improving your game is redundant. In the end it is what you are most comfortable with that works. If you change binds and your sensitivity constantly you will limit your own muscle memory and actually not improve aim wise as much as you would if you kept grinding a certain sensitivity.

In my opinion, they are the worst kind of guns you can find at any point of the game, every other weapon type finds some application outisde of the early game, pistols don't. They are rarely being used after having picked up a shotgun or a SMG.  
Even though some people prefer them, they are too inconsistent against players and way too weak against structures.  
What I think could be done is to make them relatively slow firing (2-3/sec) but buff their damage and accuracy. Unlike the other short-range options (Shotguns and SMGs), they aren't meant to be used while moving, wich is devastating in any kind of battle.

Will it ever be more than what we're getting right now, or will it stay purely as a marketing tool for them to say, we give millions of dollars to our playerbase come play our game to earn a chance at getting this money :)

  
So they announce Winter Royale 5 days ago. Say there's a million dollars on the line , it's an open qualifier and that it's going to be Solo Pop Up Cup format. So they remove solo pop up cups, for duo pop up cups. So the only realistic training you're going to get for the winter royale would be duo pop up cups, you partner up play a few games; but it's a weekday and you have work / school tomorrow so you can't play the full 4-5 hours or whatever and have to leave. You think to yourself well atleast I'll have plenty of time Friday after work / school to practice the pop up cup with my duo. You come back home and notice that now Pop Up Cup has been removed and it's the day of Friday Night Fortnite.   


I get to some extent not giving pro's or certain discords access to customs because it would feel like it seperates the playerbase or whatever, i get that. But making an open qualifer for everyone to enter that can create an account, then remove the one training everyone can get the day before the million dollar qualifiers is just ridiculous isn't it?   


It just feels like Epic's going to keep throwing around a few million dollars out of their 100 million budget solely for marketing reasons and keep making stupid oversights like 300 mat cap, 375 golden vending machines or removing any sort of realistic training from the game, adding and marketing ltms like wild west etc etc. Feels really shitty indeed can understand how the pros who actually make a living out of this feel like.",FortniteCompetitive

The aim of this is to enhance aspects that make a good competitive player - namely building and aim, and reduce “luck” in the form of reducing RNG. 

The mode would remove the following items:

- all explodes excluding grenades and stink bombs
- all smgs to reduce the spam meta
- remove the heavy sniper
- remove mini gun
-remove chillers and mounted turrets
- (potentially) all pistols, this is up for discussion

The mode would have these modifications:

- 1.5x farming
- legendary weapons can only be acquired from supply drops, making them more likely to be used and contested 

I think the format of this idea would massively reduce RNG floor and chest loot, by taking out items and rebalancing certain items to only be obtained from supply crates. This makes having a legendary item actually feel worth the risk of pushing a contested supply drop. 

Sorry about the formatting, mobile sucks, and I hope this post encourages some comp fortnite discussion! Happy thanksgiving American bröthers.

331,TheOG_Pineapple,1542968442,9zn6eg,85,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9zn6eg/new_shotgun_rework_thoughts/,1,new shotgun rework thoughts.,"I like the fact that they are trying to improve shotguns but I don't quite agree with the method of execution. First of all yada yada yada we already know you hit for 7 cause you missed your shot, however I would like to put partial blame on the reticle/crosshair design being a square instead of the traditional circle like many other games. In addition to this the pellet spread of an X reaches into the corners of the square reticle but also leaves a gap between pellets at the edges (As seen in the picture below). With all of these factors in play I wanna argue that a simple rework turning the reticle/crosshair and pellet spread into a more circular design will reduce the amount of 7 damage shots we see.

[at the moment i took this shot the entire bottom half \(if not more\) was on this the players head](https://i.redd.it/wkxd4brpv1021.png)

Secondly the choice to make it so that ""ALL shotguns will have a minimum damage of 3 pellets (even if only 1 or 2 hit)."" issa blessing and a curse to  hear. Why? I interpret this meaning that player ""A"" can wif a shot land 1 pellet and hit for 30 while player ""B"" can have slightly better aim land 3 pellets and still hit for 30. The problem that I have with this is that player ""B"" lands 3 times as many pellets than ""A"" yet they are both rewarded the same amount of damage. IMO I feel as the extra pellets should add to the base damage instead going into the abyss.

**Stop saying that in Fortnite there is no competitive mode or competitive is not really competitive.**  
Guess what? You're right! 

* As long as Fortnite is the trendiest game, there will be no truly competitive mode.  
As long as people who play one or two hours in the evening to have fun will continue to come in large numbers Epic will have **no reason to develop a competitive and skill-based game**, put it in your head.  

* Most people do NOT have time or desire to train, do NOT  want to keep up to date on new developments, but willingly spend some money to buy some skin or some pickaxe to not get bored and have something new in their hands while playing the game they like.  

* Now, I'm sure you understand how a competitive environment would **discourage the average player and divide the community**, especially in the case of Fortnite.  
People who train for hours in playground, who study the game and tactics, who inform themselves **have the sacrosanct right to be better than others and destroy the competition**, so the gap between the players who take the game seriously and who does not every day is getting bigger and bigger.  
The turret is a perfect example, it is a desperate attempt to balance the game and give a chance to casual players to win. (*and kill* ***Liquid Poach*** *multiple times lol*)  
Obviously, as the gap gets bigger and bigger, items like the turret get more stronger and broken.  

* Before judging Epic for her choices, **put yourself in their point of view**.  
Epic, from a financial point of view, can and must take advantage of this situation as far as possible, because people are fickle and trends are temporary.  
In addition, all the money they earn now will be able to invest them in the real competitive when the mainstream magic will be over and all the players really passionate about the game will remain.  

* Please be smart, **always analyze the context and actions of others and their motivations**, instead of thinking only of your own interests.

When everything passes, our time will come, but until then, stop complaining constantly, **please stop**.

**Express your opinion in the comments**, I'm always open to new ideas :)

(New gamemode idea),"# The Limitations of Battle Royale as a Competitive Gamemode

Before Fortnite came out, most competitive shooting games relied on aim and positioning as the main mechanic. Fortnite introduced building as a completely new mechanic. Building is the reason we all love Fortnite, we could care less about balloons, turrets, and shopping carts.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the battle royale genre in Fortnite limits its potential. As a competitive gamemode, its just a laggy, RNG mess. The winner is determined on who can find more rift-to-gos and mini shields. This is why Fortnite needs a new and more competitive game mode in addition to BR.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Arena

The arena could be a 5 vs. 5 gamemode in a small area such as Tilted Towers, Retail Row, new POI, etc. There would be an objective such as disabling a bomb or destroying an object. The defense would get 90 seconds to secure an area by replacing walls and placing traps. While this is happening the offense would be flying guided missiles around to find the other team. These missiles could do a small amount of player damage. After the 90 seconds are up, the offense would have three minutes to complete the objective.

&amp;#x200B;

# Classes

The offense and defense could have different classes. For example, there could be a healer that carries extra shields and meds, a builder that carries extra materials, and a sploder that carries grenades and clingers (no RPGS, GLs, etc.) These classes would have to be balanced properly.

&amp;#x200B;

# Other Notes

\-Add recoil and remove bloom to decrease RNG.

\-Disable some weapons like RPGs and double barrel shotguns.

\-Different classes could be different skins.

\-Everyone starts off at 100 health and 100 shield.

Please don’t downvote instantly, listen to my idea. I’ve never seen this before and I think this could work.

Also plz no remove mods lol I want to see how this goes.

In season 2, it was super op. Needed a removal.

Season 4, eh, a little too op, not really tho.

Season 6, we need a change.

I hate how I force myself to carry an smg and use it after every shotgun shot. I absolutely despise the playstyle of them: using rng, barrel stuffing them, barely based on aim. I want to use shotguns and shotguns only when I fight CQC, it’s just my way of playing.

In 6.31, don’t change the pump to do 100 body. I would probably quit because that’s not how the pump should work. That’s not the pump that I grew to love with.

Instead, reduce the circle timer depending on what shotgun you use.

For example(seconds):

Pump-pump: 0.9/0.8
Pump-tac: 0.7/0.6
Pump-heavy: 0.9/0.8
Heavy-tac: 0.7/0.6
Heavy-heavy: 1.0/0.9
Tac-tac: 1.0
Double barrel to any shotgun: 1.5

Same in reverse.

Maybe test this in the pop-up cup, make sure it’s not too op. Personally I think if smgs beat double shotty at the end of season 4, smgs could still beat double shotty now. That’s mainly because this isn’t nearly as good as double shotty in season 4. Maybe even re add a nerfed drum gun/Tac smg if that’s needed to counter it.

If this gets added, I would love Fortnite again.",FortniteCompetitive

But the amount of hate many many pro players (including raz but also a lot other players) is getting absurd.



Like seriously seriously absurd.



Like I understand that you may dislike some of them as most of them (as most pros in every game and sport) they seem off sometimes and have stranger thoughts but defq is wrong with you. 


Every single TMZ discussion here turns into a shit throwing contest.


Also there seems to be a new trend inside this subreddit to believe that all pros will now be irrelevant because of winter tournerment etc.



While I certainly see a good chance of some people joining the highest ranks of this game over these tournerments I dont see any top 50 pros ""getting fucked"".



I mean the top pros now like Gost, Faze, Secret, Liquid etc. have all been training for like 12h for months now and I honestly dont see them getting fucked by some random dudes that never cought attention.



I have access to the EU pro cord and their scouting methods and there are certainly a good amount of players that arent yet into skirmishes though most skirmish players are still better then these.



I think this community incredible underestimates the actual skill people like Cloak, Tfue, RazZzero0o etc. have and that they just accidently wont disappear bc the field oppend a bit. ",FortniteCompetitive

I feel the only way to actually to make the best players standout and to have more variation in points is by penalties 


Hear me out, there will be tens of thousands competing perhaps far more so the chances that there will be thousands of players with the same points makes it hard to sort the great players from the good 

My suggestion is keep the scoring system the same but if a player fails to make top 20 on a game he gets a point deducted furthermore if the player fails to get atleast 2 kills a point should be deducted 



This will balance out the score system and actually reward players who are exceptional especially when you start getting matched up with higher ranked players as playing more matches won’t always be beneficial



TLDR - players should lose a maximum of two points a game

Don’t make top 20- lose a point
Don’t get atleast 2 kills - lose a point

First of all, english is not my native language, so I'm sorry for my grammar errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I browse this and the other sub daily, and everyday there are a lot of posts like ""What Epic is doing?"", ""Epic will kill Fortnite just like Paragon"", ""Epic don't listen to the community"" and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Battle Royale is a ""new"" ESport mode, so there isn't any reference or any example of how to balance and develop a ""Competitive Battle Royale"" and also because Fortnite has a unique feature... Building.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, Epic is pushing hard with these constant updates and sometimes breaking the game with unbalaced new items. They are testing the water every new patch and that's the fastest way to get some data and try to understand HOW and WHAT is good or bad for competitive BR.

&amp;#x200B;

It's clear that Epic is not satisfied with the current state of Fortnite. They don't want 40+ players alive on the last circle, they don't want players avoiding battles, they don't want that turtleing to be the only way to play this game competitively.

All of these mobility and explosives updates are because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, there are good suggestions from this sub and from pro players, but there are A LOT of bad suggestions, ""Listen to the community"" is not to agree and implement everything the community thinks is good.

&amp;#x200B;

If they told us everything they want to test, it will change the tests results, that's how the placebo effect works.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need to stop complaining or criticize the changes, but you can try to read between the lines (and not only posting that Epic just think about skins, expand playerbase and money).

""Switch to Slot 1""
""Switch to Slot 2""
""Switch to Slot 3"" etc.
This way you can most importantly bind the slot you are usually using for shotguns to a button you are comfortable with. Right now when we get shot first and build in defense, we have to switch weapons until we reach the shotgun slot after we quit build mode.

https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v4-3

&gt;Turbo Build: Structures now build faster after the first building piece is placed.


&gt;Your first structure is built 0.15 seconds after holding the button (unchanged), any additional structures built while Turbo Building are placed after 0.05 seconds.


&gt;This fixes the issue that was occasionally causing a structure not to place when quickly building.

&gt;The reason there’s a difference in timing between the first structure placed (0.15s) and Turbo Built structures (0.05s) is to allow additional time for players to switch structure type or rotate pieces.


This means that when people are shooting their pump and trying to immediately build, for example, wall first, then ramp second -- but the wall doesn't build and only the ramp builds -- this is because the first thing you build (the wall) has a delay of 0.15sec -- and because you are switching to ramp BEFORE 0.15sec, the wall never builds and you put only a ramp instead.

The first build you place has THREE TIMES higher delay (0.15 vs 0.05) than all other builds after the first one.

This is really shitty and should be improved. The reasons they give for having this 'slower first build mechanic' seems completely outdated and obsolete. I don't think those reasons are relevant anymore. Which means they should be able to just make all builds 0.05sec and it will feel buttery smooth and have zero issues. 

This is extremely important issue, even more important than vaulting dynamite/mounted turret because this is a FUNDAMENTAL CORE MECHANIC of the game (turbo building) which is currently BROKEN AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. Please get Epic's attention somehow.",FortniteCompetitive

However, besides saying ""WhY InS't RAnKed MoDe IN ThE gAMe AlReADy"" i thought we should discuss the changes it should have from the normal public matches. I feel this is possible with the amount of player Fortnite has, and would really makes the hardcore players happy as well as retain some casuals. These changes would include something along the lines of:

*  Skilled-based matchmaking with a tier system like most other ranked modes. 
   * A point system like the tournaments
* Gold weapons can only be obtained through supply drops
   * Risk and reward to getting gold weapons rather than being ""lucky""
* Material cap of 700/600/500 with increased farming. 
   * There is skill in mat efficiency and a player should be penalized for spamming turbo build. 
* New weapons from the public matches are not automatically added into this mode but rather ""tested"" first in pubs. 
* Pros/community decide on what weapons should be added through some sort of poll. e.g. Should the minigun be in the ranked mode?
   * Would really help increase epic's communication with the community. 
* Mushrooms and apples increase to 10 shield or 10 health
   * Simply less RNG if you don't have shields or healing items
* Mobility items have a 100% spawn rate with the probability of launchpads increased significantly. 

Can you think of any other changes? I feel Epic would need a huge update based directly at fixing bugs etc. in order to make it presentable as an e-sports game. I think this should go without saying. I would really like to see a ranked mode implemented. That being said, i think's its unlucky with the addition of the tournaments (can only dream).

Xbox One X graphics are around the same as all EPIC on PC, yes even the shadows. Even motion blur is turned on and really strong. The game runs mostly fairly well in pubs (some patches fk up performance though), but in competitive matches the disvantage in late game is huge.

My Fps in late game scenarios, not even near skirmish like is around 30. In Skrimish like endings i'd guess it would be even clearly lower. Obviusly Motion Blur and strong shadows are big disvantage too.

If we are matched against PC players in tournaments, give us graphical options too. If i could recude overall texture quality, turn off shadows and motion blur, i bet my game would run so much better and make the competition more fair.

*Here are the changes I would like to see to consistency, scroll down to view my full rant about consistency :)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Make the number of materials given from the same object consistent**

I don't see a reason that the same tree can give me 26 - 32 materials. Seriously, just make it so that the same type of trees drop the same wood. This won’t affect the casual experience, I know for a fact my friends that don't play competitively don't go ""BRO, I JUST GOT AN EXTRA TWO WOOD FROM THIS TREE.""

*Pros*

\- Easier to calculate exact materials on a rotation

\- Plan ahead for how many walls can be placed before breaking something

*Cons*

\- Literally nothing (If there is one let me know kindly below)

&amp;#x200B;

**100% Chest Spawn Rate**

When I play Fortnite, casually or competitively, It is very frustrating when the start of a game is ruined by inconsistent chest spawns. I have many times hot dropped Pleasant Park and died because I couldn't get a weapon from the roof of the house. I think that having a 100% chest spawn rate would fix this issue, without disturbing casual players.

*Pros*

\- Easier to make good loot rotations

\- Much more consistent early games

*Cons?*

\- Way more loot in the game (If this is deemed a bad thing, simply remove some chest spawns from the game.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Make the Next Circle Location Visible from One Circle Before**

The best way I can describe this is what is already in the game with the Blitz game mode. When the bus is flying over the map players can see where zone on will be. However, I would take this a step further by making it so that the second circle appears on the map, in a different color, when the first zone starts to close. At this point every time the zone starts to move another circle appears on the map. This means that when the zone is moving player know where they need to move to get out of the zone now and in the future. However, when the zone is stopped they only know where the immediate next zone is.

*Pros*

\- Higher level play when it comes to rotation

\- Soccer Skins, \*Cough\*, competitive players could use different drops based on zone 1

*Cons*

\- Is a confusing concept and could be hard for the casual player to get used to (I think that if implemented properly (With Colors!) casual players would be able to understand it)

&amp;#x200B;

**Remove Weapon Rarity**

At this point, I think weapon rarity is just unnecessary and could be replaced with a better system. I'm fine with heavy shotguns being better than pump shotguns (Not with body damage!), but having blue and green varieties is just weird. Why does the same type of gun do 3 or 4 more damage based on rarity? or have a little bit better bloom? I understand that it adds some sort of placebo for casual players that might think ""OMG I GOT A GOLD SCAR,"" but after a while, most players realize that the difference is minimal among tiers. Also, the fact that there is a difference is just lazy game making in my opinion. Why should one player get to kill another based on slightly higher DPS when they have the same type of gun.

The solution to this is quite simple in my opinion. Remove weapon rarity and have classifications of weapons instead.

Ex. You could have a SCAR, Suppressed SCAR, and Famas in your Inventory, all the same color, because they are classified as ARs but are different guns fundamentally. However, having two SCARS would be almost pointless because no matter what they would have the same stats. The color difference would be based on the type of weapon. (AR, Explosive Launcher, Sniper, Pistol, etc.) This would also apply to consumables. Frag grenades would be the same color as clingers even if their spawn rates are different.

*Pros*

\- Faster looting

\- Easier balancing

\- No longer people raging about getting a white tack or burst...

*Cons*

\- Loss of some placebo effect (People would still be excited to get a sniper or SCAR over other weapons so I don't think this is a major issue)

\- Less gun variety? (But not really)

&amp;#x200B;

**Custom Crosshairs Please!**

This isn't as major as the above solutions/issues, but it's a nice quality of life change with no Cons as long as Fortnite has a good spectator system set up for Tournaments.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Full Post:**

Disclaimer: I think Fortnite is a fantastic game, one with great development and a fantastic base. I have played countless hours of the game and I truly believe that the game has the fantastic potential not yet realized. However, I do think there are some basic principles holding it back and some, relatively, simple changes that could be made to fix them. I don't have all the answers, and would love to see discussion below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Consistency in Video Games**

*Every great competitive video game is consistent in fundamental ways that allow players and teams to prove their skill.*

Take CSGO for example, when the match starts players have the same money from the start and get more money based on performance. Sure, RNG takes place when you try and no-scope with an AWP, but the flow of the match is dictated by player skill, not luck.

In Rocket League players all have hitboxes they have chosen, and mirror starting positions. There is no RNG in how much boost they have to start out with, and no RNG in the way the ball reacts to the cars.

Even Chess (I know, not exactly a video game) has both players start out on a completely even playing field before they battle wits.

This list could go on and on, but I think you get the point...

&amp;#x200B;

**Consistency in Fortnite**

It is hard to, off the top of my head, come up with a list of essential mechanics that are not in some way shaped by luck. Materials, chest spawns, ammo count, storm location, bloom, weapons, weapon rarity, health, etc; you get my point. This isn't a huge issue for casual players, but for soccer skins, \*cough\*, I mean competitive players, this RNG can literally change the course of tournaments and careers. Also, does removing RNG from many of these mechanics negatively affect the casual player experience?

So here is my question to the Fortnite developers...

Why do we have RNG with any of these mechanics?

*My solutions to some of these issues are above! :)*",FortniteCompetitive

2: 2 C4 exploded instantly for guaranteed damage. This explodes 1 after the other just like clingers and grenades. Meaning that you do have time to counter it.

3: It has the shortest throwing range of all grenades. If someone is using this, they are at the very least within Heavy Shotgun/ SMG distance (unless thrown from a mountain).

4: It takes really long to explode. You have lots of time to react to it. If someone cooks it, it is quite audible and you can react during that time.

Rather than beginning Season 7 and getting my new skins, random dances and 30 throw up emotes that I've never used once, I'd rather Epic delayed the release of Season 7 and make their game more stable.

This could also be a time for them to analyse the games direction and meta. At the time, when double pump was nerfed, it was needed. 1 pump could do 200+ damage headshot. However, if they analysed the current state of the game, what use is a pump doing 80 damage headshot? Even if you could double pump, and get 2 headshots, it would only be 160 damage. They could analyse this and see that with the current state of the game, the delay could be removed and a slight increase. I know they are updating shotguns in the next patch but it's just an example.

\-Weapon balancing

\-Server optimization

\-Ghost shots (shotgun shots not registering)

\-Also have discussions about how often new items go in to a game. Every week is getting quite frustrating, seems like I can't get used to the game because it's forever changing so much in such a short time.

This is coming from a casual player who enjoys watching the competitive scene, however, do not consider myself a competitive player.

I know Epic are a business and want to generate as much money as possible, this isn't to do with that, this is asking how the community would feel if this happened. Would the delay of Season 7 be welcome or rejected by the community.

Not enough of what is posted pertains to competitive fortnite, and we should all, from mods to members of this community, do more to help change this subreddit into something greater.

Allow me to get straight to the point, I believe that the focus and goal of this subreddit has gone somewhat off course and we should try to bring it more in line with what it should be. Now by no means do I wish to tell others what to find valuable, or imply that my vision for this subreddit supersedes that of others. Rather, I think that many of us may agree, or at the very least be aware of what the majority of the posts on this subreddit have become.

On any given day the vast majority of posts are about the current state of the game, twitch drama, complaints on one aspect or another of FN, calling out for changes or buffs, and other similar things that have little to do with discussing the competitive side of fortnite. Now if one of these topics wants to tie in to the competitive impact it has, I am all for it, but too many posts seem to have no tie in at all, or if they do are simply some variation of ""esports ready LUL"". 

There is also an incredible amount of reposting on similar topics, so much so that much of the content is simply an echo of what others have already said that same day. Instead of having 20 posts on how turrets impact the game, let's have one. Instead of having a handful of comments on each of said 20 posts let's create a genuine discussion on that one post, and really come together as a community to share ideas and have a  discord on whatever topic it may be. 

So I'd call on us as members to hold ourselves to a higher standard, to put more thought and care into posts, to do more to advance this subreddit and have it become a beacon of information and knowledge on competitive fortnite. I'd also call on the mods of this subreddit, to monitor and limit similar posts, to come together with members to write a guideline of expectations and rules for posting, to limit the scope of what is allowed up on the subreddit, and to help clean up things and prevent this from becoming the overflow for r/FortniteBR that it is slowly becoming. 

I hope that if others agree that we can begin to help enact actual change on here, and feel free to comment. If you believe I'm way off base then by all means feel free to let me know as well, as maybe I've simply confused or misunderstood what this subreddit was.

2- you don't waste mats on building high and being able to take high ground (shots) = relates to 1

3- made 3rd parties common = I can kinda agree with this for a little bit but that doesn't mean there is no counters (like disengaging, or waiting for another party to come and let the 2 teams fight it out etc.., defensive mechanics is too good now to kinda care about third parties if you play smart.)

Although I don't think it's necessary, go ahead and raise the damage if you absolutely have to. However the pellet thing seems inherently broken and here is why:

Hitting one pellet on the head and no others will reward you with 100+ damage for an extremely inaccurate shot.

I feel like this is a huge oversight. I've been playing since season 2 and back then everyone was ramp rushing to shoot their enemy from above. That way you would always headshot with the pump which meant certain death because of the massive headshot damage. I think rewarding players so massively for a sloppy headshot from above will return us to a meta like this.

On console, aim assist actually makes it impossible to shoot an exposed turret user with anything but a snipe. Aim assist is actually prioritized to the turret rather than the user. 

https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/h1-twisted/video/64043288

In this clip, you can see my reticle being strongly dragged towards the turret as soon as I zoom. My reticle goes from their head to a spot where I can no longer hit the turret user. I tried dragging it up but my reticle was locked. I know hitboxes are being adjusted but thats not enough for console users. We cant even shoot fully exposed turret users.

&amp;#x200B;

I capped the frame rate to 144, have everything on the lowest settings, resolution of 1024 x 768, and looking at the graphs on MSI Afterburner, my CPU runs at around 80% usage and my GPU at around 50%, which means the stuttering is not being caused by the CPU or GPU not handling the load. (If I uncap the framerate, cpu goes to \~100%, if I rise the settings, GPU goes to \~ 100%)

* Tried using the mode where there is no sound at all (they appear as signals on the screen)
* Tried using native res (1920 x 1080), tried using other 16:9 resolutions, tried using many different 4:3 resolutions
* Tried overclocking the gpu. It seems like it stutters less, but though my mild OC passes every stress test, Fortnite craches after a while playing when using the GPU OC
* Tried increasing the pagefile, or allowing windows to deal with it
* The HDD is mainly empty
* Tried lowering the polling of the mouse to 125

And I have absolutely no stuttering while playing CSGO

# Positioning
##Ideal for next rotation
It’s very important to know where you’re going to be going, this allows you to actively plan and allows you ample time to discuss. This also allows you to plan for enemy behavior and lets you determine the most effective path to take based on your objective/point system. 
##Risk/Reward
What will you gain out of getting in X position over Y position? 
What could you lose? How many mats do you expect to spend on a fight? What is your expected Time To Kill (TTK) for this fight/rotation?
##What's in your loadout? (Utility etc…)
This is critical to understanding how the fight can take place. If you happen to have a launchpad, are you going to use that? If so, What for?

##When to be offensive

It’s important to keep in mind your pAPM, Potential Actions Per Minute, taking advantage of what you CAN do is really important. You can assess the situation that you’re in and decide which method of engagement you want to use. Whether it’s Battering Ram, Replace Edit, or W Key. Plenty of more options on offense that will be posted in another guide.  
##When to be defensive
Or, with pAPM in mind, you can choose to not take the fight and get away. If you’re low health, or if the enemy has better positioning for that particular fight, it might be smart to not take that fight and play it slowly.
##How many are alive?
Knowing how many people are alive and knowing where they give you a great understanding of how to position in terms of risk. It also lets you know if people are fighting you can third party. Not only that, if there’s 4 alive and you’re a duo, then you know it’s either a 2v2 or a 2v1v1 which is very critical in late-game play. It also helps if you’re playing a squads game and there’s 12 alive and you see 3 - 4  people get knocked, you know it’s a safe time to start planning a third party. How many people that are left is a huge advantage to third parties. 
## Is anyone getting focused?

While thinking about your next rotation you should be actively listening for gunshots, explosives, and movement nearby. If you hear an opponent getting focused, this could be an opportunity to move because it gives one less player/team to worry about. Keep in mind the distance required on your next rotation and how long the action you’re hearing has been going on for. Early rotations are situational but for the most part very beneficial during the early-mid game. Late game early rotations can be punished very quickly if you’re not careful (try testing the waters by starting a path). If the zone is already moving and you’re in the lead or not getting focused try to get as far as you can. Keep in mind the farther you go is not always the best, try to get as far as you can to an ideal position in that zone (something that leaves options open for later zones/gives you a greater advantage on other players).
##Have you kept a low profile?
When rotating it's good to keep in mind how much information other players have on you. Have you been third partying lately? Have you used an explosive? Have you been getting spammed? All of these things should be taken into consideration before moving. If you’ve recently been third partying teams you’ve most likely let your presence

# Number Advantage
## Kiting
While in a situation where you or your team is at a number disadvantage make sure to try and kite your opponents. This keeps them off of you while your teammates can help cover and or pressure back after one of them is isolated. Keep in mind that talking about kiting is much easier than applying it in game.

##Risk/Reward
Before a fight breaks out try to take a quick note of the risks and rewards that are involved in the situation. If your risks outweigh your rewards try to consider not taking the fight. Same applies vice versa. However there are many things that can be taken into account, a few of the many being: Format of the game, Loot, Positioning, Number advantage, Damage dealt/taken etc…
##Target Management
Identifying high stakes targets, such as an RPG in play or someone who has a Heavy Sniper is huge. Know where they are so that you’re constantly aware of them. If you see a team below you that you can easily kill, and they have something that you want whether it’s materials or whatever it may be. It’s critical to understand the threat level of each opponent. The threat level of someone next to your 1x1 is high. The threat level of someone who just got out of a huge fight is rather low. This is what triggers third party impulses. Whether it’s done cognitively or whether it’s done subconsciously. 



##Team Break
Team break is when you’re shooting different builds to gain access to the same place. 
Team Break can also be when you’re shooting / axe’ing the same build to get out of zone etc.
##Team Shooting
Team shooting is shooting the same enemy at the same time. This is essential in taking 2v1’s and yields a very high success rate for many duos. 

#Pressuring / Zoning
What is pressuring and how is this different from zoning. Pressuring is when you’re trying to get people to spend economy. Zoning is when you are forcing the enemy to move to a particular place. A most common example of pressuring is wall breaks. A common example of Zoning is denying high ground.

####Pressuring with Explosives
- Grenade Launchers

- RPG’s 

- Grenades

- Stink Grenades

####Bullet Spam

- SMG

- AR

- AK

- **Turrets**

####Battering Ram

- Deagles

- Heavy Snipers

#Peeking
##Double Peek / Re-Peek
Judging by the player do you think that they will expect another peak? If you don’t think they will take another quick shot.

##Misdirection Peek / Bait
When fighting another player that is constantly hiding behind cover, try to find something or someone that will get their attention. If you can manage to bait a peak from them you can get free damage.
##Crouch Peek
Change up your movement when peeking, try to be unpredictable. This will result in your opponent missing more shots.
##Pyramid Peek (non-offensive)
Place a pyramid above your 1x1 and edit through to gain vision without putting yourself at risk. (be careful of deagles or heavy sniper combos)
##Door Peek 
When editing a door instead of a window you give yourself time to pull out your shotgun, this leaves yourself less exposed. You can alternatively ads your shotgun as soon as you open the door and shoot before it's even opened. (https://streamable.com/6whtz)
##Jump Peek
Jumping around cover or mid-fight is situational. A lot of the time this gives your opponent a target that is easily traceable because your movement can’t be changed much.

Now here is the chart for what vaulted items should return:

https://i.redd.it/a8oy3fag3lz11.png

&amp;#x200B;

For the question asking what weapon(s) should be vaulted, the majority said that the turret should be removed, which was a huge surprise! /s  
Pretty much every answer here asked for the P90, minigun, or turret to be removed, so this says that alot of you don't like spammy guns, which I agree with 100%. There is no reason why someone can stand there and empty out 999 light bullets into your builds and drain your mats, or letting someone sit in a practiacally invincible turret and destroy you. The game is in a good spot right now from what many of you said, but the future of the game is very uncertain, especially with the newly added Dynamite .

**Anxiety** is when your brain thinks it is in a situation that it does not belong in therefore it causes a range of emotional and physiological attacks in order to avoid the situation. 
Anxiety Can further enhance negative issues such as

- **Choking of shots**
- **Blanks**
- **Stutters**
- **Incorrect memory**
- **Lack of Confidence / Panic**
- **Negative self-thought**
- **Negative cyclical thinking**

# VOD Reviewing Helps
There are key ways to combat this. One of the ways to get over performance anxiety is through VOD review of the incident. VODs will capture exactly what you’re doing. Issues that occur in the game get captured in the VOD and you can train yourself for a particular situation you might find yourself in through exposure. One of the major reasons that VOD reviewing helps is it lets you look at past events with a strictly logical side. Anxiety involves a lot of emotions that can affect decision making. Looking over VODs can give you a straight logical viewpoint in order to help curb your feelings or give meaning to events.

# Mindset change
If you’re a competitive player, you should have the mindset that you belong in the games that you participate in and that you’ve earned your chance at playing in that tier. Even if you’re not a competitive player in any field that you are in,  poor self-esteem is not helpful. If you are at a tier that you have worked towards achieving you should have the mindset that you belong there and are going to work to stay or grow past there. Do not confuse this as shouldering everyone's expectations. The only person that truly needs to know your talent is yourself. Understand that panicking or worrying has no place in the match. Sure you may have fans or be under pressure by your friends but those things need to be left behind when you load into fortnite. They aren’t playing the game for you, you are, therefore you must focus on yourself and be confident in your ability to play because there is a reason that you’re there. You can also always fall back on logical solutions to confirm that you belong there. You have worked so many hours, you have created goals in order to get there, you have objective reasons why you belong. Whatever that reason may be, whether it’s being a big streamer, being invited by epic, being invited by a friend. Whatever the case may be, you need to understand that you completely belong. This is key and I’ve had to deal with this myself when I played overwatch. 

In duos, it is very important to be reassuring to your teammate in scrims and even more in scrims. If your teammate makes a mistake in a scrim, feel free to go “Oh, you should’ve saved the slurp for healgame” and then proceed to explain why. In a match, just say “Next slurp let’s save it for heals”


# How is this better?

This is better because the first example acknowledges the past, and then dwells on the past.
The second example does not focus on the unchangeable but focuses on the next play. Human beings do not like guilt and this avoids having an individual feel guilty and try to shift blame by focusing on improving for the next play.

No one wants the added pressure of “Oh shit I already messed up once” on-top of competition. Positivity in a team environment is critical in good performance. When you worry less, you play better and more confident.


# Exposure
Change your values. A great way to overcome performance anxiety is high tier exposure to what is giving you anxiety. There is actually a psychological therapy called exposure therapy that is greatly used for fear. Taking this approach yourself and exposing yourself makes your body used to handling different neurotransmitters and normalizes events for your brain. If you get anxious and start missing shots go into KovaaK’s FPS Aimtrainer and set personal goals for yourself. **Treat it like Rock Lee treats his training in Naruto.** “If I can not do X then I will do Y. If I can not do Y I will do Z.” If building is what gives you anxiety, then go into playground and do 40 90s without messing up. Add goals on top of goals. Make your practice feel so difficult that you feel accomplished after you’re done with it. Also, make sure your practice is targeted to exactly what you need to focus on.

This is a vast topic and I plan on creating further guides on this general topic. I thank Blake for all of his help and expertise in the creation of this guide. If you have any questions or want to discuss with me about things feel free to contact on discord.

DP gave you guaranteed damage if you had good aim. unless you're stopping to get FSA with the deagle (which you aren't), you're pretty much just rolling the dice with the deagle. but this isn't a double pump post. it's an anti P+D post.

&amp;#x200B;

i mean, don't get me wrong. it's alright if you want to dick around in pubs. but if you're in a scrim or anything remotely competitive? you're increasing how much luck you need as well as disadvantaging yourself. who is winning in a REALLY close quarters fight, i mean like inside a 1 by 1 fight: a guy who is rocking pump + smg, or a guy who is rocking pump + deagle? 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't get the wank for pump + deagle. i don't play the game anymore so maybe it's different, but from what i remember, it was not reliable. i still watch scrims and i plan to watch this winter skirmish, though. i'll be interested if there's any variety in the loadouts or if it's just the same thing it has always been.

The reason shotguns only hit for 7 was because only one pellet hit. This means you just didn’t aim well. When this is released it will reward players for aiming poorly.

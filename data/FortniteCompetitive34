And by judging the recent updates this doesn't seem like much of a rumor. The drum gun took absolutely no skill to kill someone with, and 80% of anyone's deaths were to the drum gun. There is no balancing it, it's just a broken item that needs to stay deep within the vault.",FortniteCompetitive

I am honestly amazed at how few shields I find now. My duo partner and I consistently have 15+ kill games between us and we are still finding ourselves end game with nothing but bandages...  because of this we end up fighting a team that has been looting the whole game and has full shields.

Fortnite would not be a worse game if every house guaranteed had at least one shotgun, one chest spawn and one AR with the rest being random as hell if you want or something along those lines.
For example: Vending machines shouldn’t be random, there should be at least a few reliable factors in the game to not make for literally unwinnable situations that are not fun for anyone regardless of whether they have a 0.1 kd or 10kd. ",FortniteCompetitive

I am not a competitive pro player just someone trying to improve 430~ wins 2.30 kd in solos and 1.77 kd in squads this season I am not a pro or streamer but I’m not bad either 
Anyway in solos I play good and can kill most people I engage with and I have a relatively good kd (Not good for you but I think 2+ is good) I want to have a 2kd but when I play with friends they always steal my kills as I play tactically but they just rush in and either die or get the kill, I am shit early game if I don’t get a pump I’m basically dead but if I have a lot of mats I’m quite good I think its because i’m a “playground player” i build alot and can do 1v1s but when its me v a 4 man squad I can nearly never clutch unless they are shit
Basically what I am saying is a keep dropping 0 kills in squads as I either die off spawn or teammates steal most of my kills, the only reason my kd is not low is because some games I get 10+ kill wins and it makes up for it but does anyone have tips to improve squads with friends?

Meaning you jump from the bus you have skydive then you land and 15 seconds later a circle appears. 3 minutes later it starts moving and you receive an on screen indication that you've gained a redeploy. Then circle meets and next one is shown. Time goes by then it starts moving and you get another on screen display and so forth. I think it deals with the fact that you don't want to be able to spam redeploy. It's great for movement but it's not ideal to have it always on because of 3rd partying and just contently running. It also give strategy a mindful thought yes having an item slot taken up deserves a strategic thought. But knowing more about position, Time till a cirlce moves, speed of a circle moving I think these provide for a smarter player.

But in pubs it seems like everyone is using balloons and the players in pubs are obviously not as good as pros and don't seem as able to exploit the weaknesses of balloons to triumph over the balloon user. It is common to see people using balloons for whole matches and it kind of obviates the need for building. You don't need to build because you can just float up to someone and you don't really need to build to protect yourself because it can be difficult to get a good shot at someone floating really high even though they will have more bloom than you.

First off, most of you will know convertible from his overly long essays that just point out the obvious things in peoples gameplay. I don't need to know every little detail about every single play that every player makes, how do you know what is right and wrong with THESE SHITTY ASS STATS https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Convertibless

YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME HOW THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT TO TEACH IT

How Convertible became famous:

You've probably seen videos about people hiring their kids' coaches to boost their self-esteem, which is pretty fucking embarrassing. Like what type of loser would make parents pay them their hard worked money to teach a 7-year-old kid to play fornite right? Well, the answer is CONVERTIBLEFN. This loser is charging people lessons for a FREE GAME when there are tips videos all over the face of youtube. You are a scamming little scum, plain and simple. Get a real job. ""I will stick to my motto. As long as I can help just 1 person, get even 1% better. Then I will continue to do what I do, absolutely and completely free of charge until absolutely no one needs it anymore."" -ConvertibleFN So, as you can see Convertible is stating that he will do all of his lessons free of charge, but if you go onto this website you will see that he charges 92 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR A 5 HOUR COACHING LESSON 

https://www.gamersensei.com/senseis/convertiblefn

Going against your own word eh?

Why Convertible is idolized by the fornite competitive community:

There is only one reason why Convertible is so famous and idolized around this shitty community: HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO DO WHAT HE WAS DOING. If I started ""coaching"" all the way back when he was doing it I would probably be just as good or even better at what he is doing. If you want to become good at this game DO NOT take this guys advice or do what he says to do. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR and be an independent player learn off your own mistakes, not off some random Indian loser's coaching advice. The only reason people care about him is he was the first one to do it and they don't want to lose him. He's like the Arnold Schwarzenegger of Fortnite, you've been through your glory days, NOW JUST RETIRE ALREADY. Coaches do not belong in this game, plain and simple. Coaches belong in Team VS Team games, not a battle royale. I'm fine with people like ImSpeedyGonzalez who are actually good at the game and just share their tips and tricks to other people because they actually PLAY THE GAME! People like Convertible get hired to professional esports ORGS to coach their fortnite players which is just extremely insane. 

Why Convertible Isn't a reliable coach

Lets start off by looking at one of the most successful football coaches of all time: Pep Guardiola. He was won 14 titles in 4 years total. You would wonder how he became such a successful coach? He played a full football career and was a very astonishing player on the field. Now let's look at one of the most successful fortnite coaches Convertible. I wonder how he got all of his knowledge? FUCKING NOTHING. He has played 9 GAMES IN SEASON 7 and this community calls him a reliable coach!?! That is just sad. You cannot coach something you don't play

Conclusion: ConvertibleFN does not deserve any of the attention that he gets. I still respect him as a person and don't hate him, but in this post you will see that he is just a lucky, unreliable source who just spams words in his shitty essays about OTHER PLAYERS if you want to improve YOURSELF watch VODS of YOURSELF. Thank you for listening to my opinion on Convertible and I hope atleast 1 person agrees with my opinion.",FortniteCompetitive

There are a lot of problems with Fortnite right now and the gameplay is so much worse compared to the earlier seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Glider redeploy. Seriously Epic, why do we need another mobility item? There have been a lot of complaints about this feature in the game and yet you still persist on adding such. At this current point of the game, if the zone is too far, one can simply use a plane, use a balloon, use a launchpad, use a quadcrasher, use a rift, and use a rift to go. This new feature is not overpowered like the one added in Fortnitemares but it just dilutes the loot pool so much more when its purpose can be done by several other items. This item is so common that we barely get shield at all.

2. Less shields. Since the loot pool is so diluted right now, finding shields are as hard as they can be. It feels like a relief everytime we get shields from the chest unlike before when it is no big deal. Unvaulted feels so good because there is a big percentage that a big shield will drop from the chest. Epic needs to understand that less is more in a rng game. This game is becoming more rng because having 200 hp is literally a huge advantage to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Planes. The recent update is so bad that the issue with the planes  are forgotten. Literally, there is no satisfaction in killing someone while third partying and just ramming through their builds. I get the point that the planes give the newer players the chance to kill good players but it just brings more bad than good. I like the planes as a mobility item but not as a weapon. You are already given the advantage of mobility and a glider redeploy to land anywhere you want without minimal chances of being hit yet they also give you the capabilities to instantly kill 2-3 players having a build battle by just simply ramming through their builds? The ""ramming through builds"" feature of the plane needs to be removed. I have seen and experienced myself, being killed by a player by just only ramming through my build while I'm build battling a very good player.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Vault useless items or items that have overlapping purposes. There are a lot of items that can be vaulted right now to clear up the loot pool. Some of them are dynamites, boom boxes, scoped revolver, scoped ar, bolt action (don't really know what to feel with this but it seems like people are 99% going to take the suppressed version), famas, turrets, port-a-fortress, and the bush (nostalgic but seriously speaking, with how fast players improve because of creative and playground, almost no one uses this item). The drop rates of balloons can also be severely reduced to give way for shields.",FortniteCompetitive

The one mode out of all of them that **encourages / promotes** building battles has been discarded out of the game.

The one mode that allowed good players to perform and constantly reach top 10 has not been added back into the game for how many seasons now.

I think most of us can agree how dull and demotivating solos are right now.

- 20 players left after the first circle

- Spending 10 minutes finding good loot and harvesting materials to max just to get killed in the many bullshit ways to die.

- Not finding any players due to midgame being an absolute borefest.

- Not finding any shields.

Blitz literally fixes all these issues, just imagine the Blitz mode with mats and health per kill, I wouldn't get off the game.

Epic needs to understand that there is a playerbase out there that *only* plays this game for the build battles and the high intensity fights it brings. It is the trademark of this game.

Every time I play I feel like I have to do chores such as finding good loot and harvesting full mats just to finally get into a good build battle which is so rare.

**Please Epic, bring back Blitz.**

Due to the lack of shield in the game, and for some reason we keep getting new items for mobility and weapons, but not heals / shield. Why don’t we have this already?  I think it could be such a great item. 

Could have a similar drop rate to campfires,  and similar or even slower rate of shield gain.  

I can only assume that we aren’t going to see the drop rate of shields change, but maybe Epic could add something like this. Campfires are clutch and I feel like the Cauldron could be too. 

Imagine being in a squad game low on heals or shield and finding a cauldron to get the entire squad topped up.  Come on epic!!!

As a long time solo grinder, and someone with almost 4,000 solos played, I had a lot of fun with and put a lot of time into Solo’s, it was my main mode. I love the intensity of end game, the feeling of winning, I live for that shit. But the more I played, the less winning meant to me. I set arbitrary goals at 5, then 10, 50, 100 solo wins. After hitting all those I set out for 200. After 200, everything felt different. What was the point at setting a higher number? I know I could probably win a handful of games a day, and hit any single number I wanted at this point (with enough time put in), so the grind kinda stopped for me. Aiming for that intensity in end game was amazing, and was a huge part in me starting up a scrim discord in April. Hitting the win #’s gave me an arbitrary goal to aim for. Neither of those really exist for me anymore outside of scrims, which barely exist for Solo’s. 

You know what could solve this problem, and encourage people to spend more time playing with an actual goal in mind?

- Turret

Frustrating items:

I've noticed 4 things that have made editing more consistent (for me at least):

1. **Standing closer to the build I'm trying to edit**. I was one for increasing edit sensitivity primarily due to how clunky editing close to structures was. To bypass this, I had gotten used to editing further away from structures since it was easier with the slower aim sens. I'm sure with more practice, my consistency with editing further away will improve. However, for now, standing closer seems to help a lot (as expected with this new higher sens). 
2. **Consciously ending my flicks for selecting tiles half a second earlier**. This primarily applies to walls. I had gotten a muscle memory for quick diagonal wall edits and remembering to stop slightly earlier has reduced selecting too many tiles.
3. **Focusing on the beginning tile and ending tile when beginning and ending the edit**. This applies to walls and stairs. Focusing on the ending tile when beginning the edit had helped tremendously with the consistency of my edits on aim sens edits. Until I have the muscle memory for selecting the beginning tile on building sens, focusing on both will have to do. While this *potentially* makes your edit slower, I would rather have a negligibly slower edit (for now) than choke the edit.
4. **Practice (Obviously).** Personally, I've been using the Aim + Building Practice course by u/OfficialCanDook. Here is the link/code: [https://epicgames.com/fn/0237-9611-6059](https://epicgames.com/fn/0237-9611-6059) . Grinding it out in creative first is going to save me the frustration of going straight into matches.

I've read some posts that people are having better success with edit mode aim assist on, but it was far too annoying for me.

I usually like to drop somewhere where I have about 2-4 people landing with me, so that I'm not affected by early game rng as much as in a hot tilted drop for example, and after that I'm just rotating, trying to find as many people as possible without using planes, since they aren't really fun to play for me. I just like to play the game as we did before we had all that crazy stuff.
But lately I'm having a hard time to find people, it's very hard for me to get to 10-15 kills in a match just because people are dying so early, and also the fact that you often end up without heals/mats after killing a lot of players screws me sometimes.
So how do you guys go about solos right now so they don't get too boring but also not too frustrating?

I'm going to start with the cons first because it's more important.

Cons: players with high building sensitivty are forced to put it down.

Walls can be difficult to make corner edits on especially the top corner parts.

Pros: floors and stairs can be edited way faster with these changes.

Editing the top 3 tiles of a wall is insanely faster. 

Edit aim assist will help players with high sens but I ended up turning it off because it often locks onto the middle tile but makes it so you don't  mess up your edit by going off the editable parts.


Overall: I am unhappy because its forced me to put my building sens down from 1.64 to 1.5 but maybe overtime I will slowly put it back up.

This is still a bad change because it forces you to change something and should be a optional change.

I still think we need a edit slider as for of us it makes building sens almost useless and will make it even harder to compete with PC players. ",FortniteCompetitive

Epics continuous steam of pointless new item? Epic not optimizing the game? 
    Yeah me too, that’s why I have deciding to not support epic by buying the battlepass next season and if you are thinking of purchasing it just know, YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE BOT. 
    Look the point of this post is not to change any minds or discuss the impact the competitive community could have on Epic with a boycott, it is to enlighten, hopefully one other human, on how capitalism works.
    If you are a corporation you do what makes you the most money, they see what consumers consume and provide more product. As a consumer you VOTE for what you SUPPORT with your money. 
    With this in mind I will be refusing to support epic anymore by not buying the BOT BATTLEPASS that is season 8. That is until epic takes serious steps for the competitive community.Also I would like like to publicly state that anyone I see next season with a battlepass skin is a certified bot!!! You’ve been warned. 

NICE PART OF POST PLEASE READ

Sorry for that negativity up there but here’s the thought process behind it. Obviously we are a small community compared to the whole of the FN scene and in order for people outside of the competitive reddit sub to buy into a boycott of the season 8 battle pass it would need a catchy phrase like BOT BATTLE pass that can be used to convey a larger idea much like a campaign slogan. The larger idea in this case being the need for epic to change its approach to the game. To have an impact bot battle pass would ha e to become a meme started by streamers that young kids(largest player base) would have to internalize and participate in the boycott because say their favorite streamer would call them a bot if they bought the battlepass.

Personally I doubt anything will happen from this post but we do have over a month until the next season to spread the word about why only bots will be getting the battle pass next season. You don’t want to be a bot? Easy don’t buy the next battlepass and aye tell a friend they’re a bot if they’re thinking about it ;)

Other slogans are welcome! 

Everyone will be considered a bot and I will be the alpha until public acknowledgement has been made that you will not be be purchasing the BOT BATTLEPASS so what do you bots think?  ",FortniteCompetitive

I don’t understand the amount of turmoil and toxic rage the planes cause, especially on this subreddit. Maybe 2 out of 10 times that I get straight kamikaze’d on by someone who’s at the same time fucking my face with a turret do I actually get killed, I just think most people counter them the wrong way.
It’s in everyone’s nature to build when being attacked by something but standing in place trying to spam a 1x1 with a roof around yourself only makes you a sitting duck for those magic turbobuild-piercing turret bullets and inevitably the planes long hard dick when it rams into you and sends you flying from Polar Peak to Lonely Lodge.
If youre sitting in a 3 or 4 story tall 1x1 putting a floor and roof above yourself and just sitting there isn’t the way to go either, you’re going to blast off like Team Rocket again.

In my experience I’ve found that making minimal movement, only strafing left and right while spam crouching like you’re trying to get to Platinum in Rainbow Six’s current meta and placing a few walls here and there to block some bullets works a lot better, but ONLY if when the plane is close enough you rush towards it like a madman and jump on it when he boosts giving you an easy one pump on him.

Or just deagle them in the head, that works too ;)

Hardly.

If this change had been made and the heavy sniper didn’t exist I would agree, BUT what was the point in using the bolt over the heavy before this patch? Better damage, one shots walls, less bullet drop. 

At least now if you back yourself to have good aim you can take the bolt for it’s faster fire rate due to faster reload. It was ridiculously conflicting having varying bullet drop on three types of the same weapon, the RNG aspect of the game means you don’t always have a choice over which you used, at least now they are all the same to use. Personally I think the correct adjustment was to meet somewhere in the middle between the bolt bullet drop and the heavy since the heavy made sniping in the game easier in general, which I would obviously rather it wasn’t. 

I just wish people on this sub would have a more pragmatic approach as opposed to simply banging the skill gap drum again and again whenever any change is introduced. ",FortniteCompetitive

It’s not hitscan, so it still takes a certain level of skill to use them so stop acting like snipers are the new golden scar and you will immediately hit every single shot with them.

Or thinking it's justified because mini's take the lowest time to consume and you now only have as much shield in your inventory as slurps or big pots.

These arguments completely miss the real point on why mini's were nerfed. Mini's only get you up to 50 shield. That's what makes up for it taking the lowest time to consume or for having more of them in your inventory.

This is the reason it was the favourite healing item of aggressive players. They are better than most other players and therefore willing to trade the 50 additional shield for a lower time to consume. It enables them to quickly pop 2 mini's and move to the next fight / fight the 3rd party.

A less skilled player will not pick a lot of fights and therefore takes his time to go back to full shield after a fight with a chug or big pots.

This is another change that lowers the skill gap. There's nothing more behind it. With only 6 shields in their inventory, a skilled and aggressive player will run out of shield before end game, giving a less skilled player who has camped and therefore still has 100 hp + 100 shield a good chance of winning. This is what epic wants because it's what keeps the less skilled players around.

This is not a rant, I haven't played the patch yet and I'm not sure how I feel about the mini nerf, but this is the real reason why Epic nerfed the mini's. It comes down to keeping as much players as possible around, which I can understand from their perspective.",FortniteCompetitive

* Fixed a bug where your ability to fire would be delayed after discarding a Grappler.
* Removed the ability to ride or be pushed by a Grappler due to the ability for players to move fast enough to cause network issues.
* Fixed Balloons not being popped by explosions.
* Fixed issue causing odd dynamite size/scaling when picking it up and re-throwing.
* When a player dies from Down-But-Not-Out bleed-out damage, the elimination distance is calculated from the original down location rather than the distance when they are fully eliminated.
* Fixed an issue that could cause Scoped Rifles to have full accuracy earlier than intended.
* Fixed an issue where the center dot of the reticle while scoped did not line up with the center dot while unscoped.
* Fixed dynamite re-throw ability from being canceled by changing weapons or being a vehicle passenger.
* Players will no longer receive credit for a “No Scope” in the elimination feed if they use a scope to eliminate a player.

* Rather than moving at max speed as soon as entering the zipline, players will now accelerate over time to reach that max speed.
* Destruction effects have been turned back on while riding a zipline.
* Players will destroy the nearby player buildings before attaching to the zipline so their path becomes clear
* Added a third decimal place for mouse/controller sensitivity to allow for more granular values.
* To help with situations where walls are built mostly underground, we've [added functionality](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aewj0q/wall_placement_and_you/)
* This occurs when the wall piece is showing less than 30% above ground.
* Gamepad Sensitivity
* Building sensitivity change also applies to edit mode.
* Editing will no longer interrupt gun fire and pickaxe swings.
* Corn stalks will no longer block gunfire.
* Editing a structure will now begin without waiting for a response from the server. This should cut down on ghost shots before editing and make it a smoother experience.
* Confirming the edit will still require sending data to the server and be impacted by high ping or poor server performance.
* Vehicle impact damage to a player will now respect shields instead of directly applying to player health.
* When a plane explodes due to any reason, it will now deal damage to both passengers and pilots. This damage no longer ignores shields.
* Infinite dab is even more infinite...Dab for 11 hours instead of 10 hours in the lobby.
* Adjusted map art to more accurately represent player &amp; marker positions.
* Textures of props used in emotes are now pre-streamed so scorecard and other emotes that use props will have less chance of using a low-resolution texture.
* X-4 Stormwing passengers now have the same Hold to Exit functionality as pilots.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed instances of glider redeploy not deploying when exiting a Stormwing.
* Fixed grenade throw animations not playing the follow-through when watching other players throw a grenade.
* Fixed the preview length on many emotes in the lobby to hear the full music track.
* Completing the ""Play a match with a friend"" Daily Challenge now correctly counts towards other quests that require completing daily challenges.
* Fixed players not being able to destroy the Boombox from certain distances.
* Fixed some issues with ziplines
* Players will no longer be flung across the map or get in broken animation states.
* A cooldown has been added to ensure jump spamming will not allow players with mild network issues to fall through the zipline collision.
* The zipline magnet will no longer remain over players heads.
* Players no longer fall when colliding with enemy structures.
* Players no longer dismount ziplines at steep angles when under bad network conditions.

Fixed an issue where players would sometimes take 2 instances of impact damage from getting hit by the X-4 Stormwing.

* Damage numbers when shooting Mounted Turrets now properly displays as vehicle damage instead of player damage.
* Players who are emoting on the starter island will no longer continue emoting after jumping from the Battle Bus.

Gliders and Umbrellas will no longer appear sideways or misaligned when dropping from the Battle Bus.

### Events

* Tournament systems have been significantly updated to support upcoming features. We’ll be operating a series of small scale test events as we test these updates with more players.

We will be testing in waves until we are confident in the new functionality. At that point, we will again begin running tournaments regularly for all players.

Older tournaments will be removed from the Events tab on Switch &amp; mobile devices for the time being.

* Data for those tournaments has been saved and will return to those platforms in a future release.
* Players will be automatically removed fthe rom match after 60 seconds of spectating after being eliminated.

### Audio

* Fixed shield damage sound playing when shooting or getting hit by teammates.
* Gliders that have music can now play their music in the lobby for previewing.
* Reduced the volume of the X-4 Stormwing.
* Reduce the volume of the Boombox.
* Added unique bouncing sound to Dynamite.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed music cutting out on mobile/Switch platforms.
* Fixed incorrect boost audio loop for Quad Crasher on mobile/Switch.
* Fixed missing medium-distant Scoped AR gunshot sounds.
* Fixed loud winter biome ambient audio on mobile/Switch.

### UI

* Updated the ammo icons in the inventory to look more realistic.
* Building resources of spectated players are now visible.

**Bug Fixes**

* Prevent pickup HUD interaction prompts from appearing while in a vehicle, since picking up is disabled while in a vehicle.
* Fixed error displays when a friend request fails.
* Prevented special preview actions (Play Again, Switch Model, Full Screen, etc…, shown when viewing a cosmetic item) from disappearing after opening and closing the chat window.
* Fixed a red background showing up when the chat window is opened while doing a 'Full Screen' preview of a Loading Screen cosmetic.
* Prevented unrelated loading screens from sometimes showing up instead of the selected Loading Screen while doing a 'Full Screen' preview.

### Social

* Battle Royale players can now accept party invites from players in Save The World and join games in progress.

### Art + Animation

* Both Lynx and Zenith now have custom idle poses in the lobby.",FortniteCompetitive

This kind of scrim was originally inspired by ISpotYouDrop, who was hosting viewer scrims like this on stream yesterday.  We distinguished ourselves by all wearing lynx skins and promising not to attack each other before the 5th circle. At first, they seemed like they would be extremely boring, but they actually ended up being extremely fun and allowed me to practice late game scenarios much more efficiently than normal scrims.  After his stream ended, my friend and I thought it would be a great idea to make a server dedicated to these kinds of scrims, which we are currently in the process of making.  

Another thing I loved about these scrims is that nobody ever died off spawn, saving me and many others a significant amount of frustration and waiting time in between games.  Along with this, because there were so many more people in the later circles, we ended getting end circles with 60+ people at max, which was crazy considering that ISpotYouDrop had around 300 viewers during these scrims.  

So my question to you guys is what do you think about these kinds of scrims? Would you play them?  
Do you think they would be more enjoyable than traditional scrims?  Any feedback on this idea appreciated!",FortniteCompetitive

If you think about it, the main issues players bump into when redeploy is active are either, A. 3rd parties you dont get many chances to recover from or B. Not being able to punish players for building carelessly. 

In an environment where shields and materials per kill is active the 1st issue wouldnt, in theory be as prevalent because the 1st person/team that wins would be rewarded for his efforts immediately before the 3rd party can swoop in and get an unfair fight, and thus an easy elim, leaving the 3rd party no choice but to engage mid fight, possibly hurt one of the 2 teams, and swoop in for the kill and risk getting focused by the other initial team that was taking part in the engagement.

For the 3rd party to be optimally beneficial/fatal would require the 3rd party to have impeccable timing and synergy, and to read when the time is right to 3rd party so they can get a fell kill on the team/ person that has already been badly hurt. To keep it short, the 3rd party leading to almost CERTAIN death due to GR would be a rare occurence in the oncoming format especially since only a certain amount of players will have the GR item in their inventory. 

Now let's address the second point, players like to be able to punish reckless buildfights that reach unsafe heights, but to keep it short, how many times do we even see competitive players in relevant tourneys/ high point pop ups carelessly build fight without being weary of the possibility someone breaking the foundation, let alone die to fall damage because they failed to disengage after they notice the offending 3rd party. The only con I can see form the 3rd parties POV is the fact that instead of disengaging downwards their targets now have the ability to disengage and abandon the initial fight completely after getting their health widdled down,which I dont really have a problem with except for the possible late game server congestion.

The re-introduction of glider redelpoy is, in my opinion more beneficial to the game competitively because,with the mat cap, you are essentially forced to sacrifice a slot for mobility(grappler) regardless because tunnelling wouldnt be as effective due to the 1500 cap paired with moving zones. Giving the competitive community more late game mobility options besides rift to gos and grapplers in this meta, will as far as I can see have a positive late game effect with minimal mid game detriments unless it has an absurd drop rate and usage amount. 

What negative impact do you guys think the GR will have competitively in the new meta?? ",FortniteCompetitive

All it takes it for some default to place one down at the bottom of a build battle and its free kills. It should be risk vs reward; you expose your location by shooting to break builds, vs the reward of breaking down the structure and getting kills from fall damage. But nope, now you can stay hidden and just chuck down this item that lasts FAR too long. 

The tipping point for me was just now. I died to a really good player and wanted to watch them to see how they play. They got into a nice battle with another good player. They were only about 4-5 levels up so they didn't die from fall damage, but when they both landed on the ground and tried to place walls, they couldn't, and the default hiding in the bush got two kills. I then proceeded to watch this same default walk waltz into the final two, where they then did not place a single wall or ramp and tried to win against the other last player by shooting them with an SMG from about 100m. 

If you want to give players as bad as that a chance, how about adding ranked mode? Not these annoying, ridiculous items. ",FortniteCompetitive

Seemed like the community was pretty split when it came to who liked it and who didn't.

It's been a while, but now glider redeploy will be returning, but as a RARE ITEM. I just wanna discuss how this effects the game, and whether or not it's better than glider redeploy in its former state

The biggest negative that I see is that it's now 100% RNG based. It used to available to every single player in the lobby, but now it will only be available to the players who are fortunate enough to loot it. 

The biggest positive that I see is the same ones as before. You're able to avoid taking fall damage from you builds being shot out, as well as increased mobility around the map helping with high kill games and avoiding storm damage.

Since glider redeploy is an item, I wonder if you'll be able to drop and give charges to your teamates.

The item is going to be very valuable during scrims for obvious reasons. This will create advantages for players/teams with glider redeploy providing easier rotations in late game circles. But on the other side of the coin, late game rotations will still be difficult for teams/players without glider redeploy and all because the RNG wasn't on their side

Is this the correct way to bring back glider redeploy, or was it better in it's former state a few months back? What are your concerns with it being brought back in the form of an item? Any positives or negatives that you can project? Hoping to open up a constructive dialogue and gather other's thoughts on the matter. ",FortniteCompetitive

After what I am hearing today I am absolutely disgusted with epic games and further convinced that competitive Fortnite will never happen. I am not even angry, I am just sad that such a good game with so much potential is just wasted because epic games wants to be greedy.

In this update the only thing the competitive player will gain is the ability to place walls underground without losing mats. 

Things we are about to lose: Deagle (potentially) this is a huge issue because I believe it is one of the very few guns in the game that is not overpowered by itself but in the hands of an experienced player it is deadly. By removing this gun you are only shortening the skill gap. Period. 

Adding in another 100% accuracy weapon is another big issue. To add to the cesspool of over saturation that is fortnite’s weapon pool; we are about to get a weapon that is almost guaranteed to be terrible. Ex: scoped AR and thermal AR.

These updates make it increasingly harder to find MY load out. Ex. Every game the ideal setup is heavy AR, pump, deagle. That doesn’t mean I need to find that combo every game but you are just diminishing the chances of people finding their go-to weapons. 

Are the developers really that dumb to believe their game will die out if they don’t aggressively cater to the default player? 

Epic, take some lessons from games like cs go. Eventually all you will have is your competitive community and by then you will have turned everyone away. 

Never have I ever seen a company so greedy and self destructive when it is the best of its class. Just a shame. Shame on you epic. And shame on anyone who is ok with this. 

Rant= over. But geez epic you are showing your truly colors and they aren’t pretty.

- Blocks a slot (10 uses)

- Contrary to grappler / portable rift it doesn't give you highground for free, you can only glide down. You can't rotate up mountains for free contrary to the other mobilities.

- You can't just escape out of a 1x1 on the ground when you are low on hp

- Adds another kill incentive (10 uses are a lot and when you kill someone who got the item, it's likely you'll have a decent amount left for end game) 
-&gt; Maybe you even see that someone's got the item in his inventory similar to the jetpack, we don't know yet. People would be thirsty to kill someone with that item, when they don't have mobility yet.

- Yes it's another rng item but as a result it will be less likely for you to not have mobility in late game (also I think we don't know the rarity so far so it could potentially be very common) and I don't see why that's a bad thing

I'm open for arguments why I'm wrong, but I don't get why this addition should make the game worse. Btw as some people mentioned before I think a better solution would be to let everyone spawn with the item in his inventory and the amount of redeploys should be lower imo.

Do they have any idea how diluted the loot pool already is?  Now they are adding two more items with this latest update so I can continue to not find a proper early game load out?

I can’t wait to drop a house and find a glider so I can glide across the street and be pumped in the face. Maybe I’ll use some balloons and then glide my way down? 

Why you adding another mobility item to the game? You are forcing planes on us, the most cancerous mobility item to date, and you don’t still don’t think there is enough mobility?  There are already too many items in the game. We don’t need a scopes pistol we already have a deagle!  What the hell is your major malfunction?

You should be focusing on removing items to clear up an already diluted loot pool. Explosives are one thing that need to be looked at. The quad launcher needs to go and dynamite needs to go. The scoped 6 shooter needs to GTFO before even being introduced. The glider as an item needs to GTFO as well. It should not exist and it leads me to wonder what in the actual f**k is going on at Epic.  Oh boy how much fun it’s going to be getting into a build battle to just have my opponent jump off and float away without me being able to follow him. Now I’m stuck up on a build with little to no mats and I have to get down before a plane ass blasts me across the map. If I do happen to get down I get the pure enjoyment of spending the next 5 min chopping down every single thing I see just so I can attempt to have enough mats for the late game. 

Again, what I. The actual f**k is going on at epic? I love how after the sword fiasco and the plans you claimed to be more transparent moving forward. By transparency do you mean telling the community less than 24 hours before a patch that you decided to add something in you knew would cause backlash?

Will I stop playing this game? No. Will I continue to be more upset with the direction this game is going? Absolutely! I am honestly surprised there is not a big tournament scheduled for tomorrow for this broken ass item being added. 

You think mobility is still an issue Epic?  Rifts. That’s right, rifts are your answer or at least the most balanced answer to date. Bring back the rifts how they were. They are the most balanced rotational device to ever be put in the game. You could only go so far using a rift. They couldn’t help you fly forever and ever. They did not turn your character into Superman blasting through everyone’s builds! Surprisingly, and god damn do i mean it when I say surprisingly, they were/are pretty fucking balanced. I can’t believe I just called something epic put in fortnite balanced. 

Well my rant is over.  Ill just continue on as with what has become a “normal” gameplay session of constantly yelling at my monitor about how Epic needs to get rid of all the garbage they are vomiting into this game!  Can’t wait sounds like f**king blast!

* Remove planes and zip lines 
* Instead add more quads around the map and maybe a couple rifts here and there where there use to be zip lines. (only if there aren’t already any near by)
* Remove ATK’s and replace with quads 
* Also remove all carts since there is no use for them and for every 5 in an area add 1 quad around that area 
quad crashers and rifts are the most balanced mobility while notability zip lines are very buggy. if zip lines were fixed and polished then they wouldn’t be a bad thing to keep
* Rift to go i think is okay but i want to know what you think 


GRAPPLER
* my belief is that the grappler should be vaulted. it is to easy to use and require no skill 
* instead replace them with impulses and maybe make them drop in bigger stacks ( 5 seems good ) 
* impulses with some skill does what the grappler does and better with more versatility
* now the issue is; is it worth bringing back the bouncers ? in my opinion it is not needed but i’m not really against it. let me know what you think 

EXPLOSIVES 
* my opinion in this matter is to vault all explosives except grenades. 
* RPGS , QUAD , GL all vaulted unless there was a way to keep these all reserved for drops and make ammo more scarce. 
this in the overall will help keep things balanced since explosive spam will be reduced and grenades are more manageable. 
* Bye Bye Boom Box

MINI GUN
* either vault it or give it a cool down and reduce ammo acquired when getting it from a chest 

HEALTH
* Health and Mats per kill is a must but finding the sweet spot is what is important.
* Syphon is a great example on how a system similar could work but pop up cups also demonstrate a good mechanic. 
* Knowing which the community likes more or finds most balanced is ultimately the correct one. let me know what you think 

MATERIAL GATHERING 
* i think we can all agree that farming mats is the most boring thing in existence and just increasing material gathering and lowing cap like pop up is the best way to alleviate this chore 

EXTRA VAULTS 
* Vault Pistol / Keep silenced pistol 
* Vault Heavy sniper or nerf 
150 damage anywhere is absurd especially with the lack of shields
Even worst it’s the easiest sniper to use with its low drop so maybe even fixing that could help 
* Vault FAMAS 
* Vault Bush
* Vault Balloons 
super silent, super common, makes building irrelevant. no need for it to be in the game. Balloons felt more balanced when it had to be held in the hand 
* Vault Hunting Rifle 
so many snipers in game and leaving this gun almost irrelevant with its lack of damage. I use to love the hunting rifle 
* Vault Boogie Bomb 
* Vault Port a Fortress 
* Vault Mounted Turret 
Most of these vaults or mainly because the loot pool is so big that some things just should taken out for the sake of keeping pool in a better range. 

With all that being said let me know what you think or anything that i forgot that should be talked about.

I guarantee 99% of players would rather have re-deploy back in the way it used to be combined with vaulting planes.

Same thing happened to bounce pads and shockwaves, which both had a little ""skill gap"":

Bounce pads: were used to avoid fall damage, push people or outplays like the Nate Hill ""get fcked kid"" clip

Shockwaves: were used to avoid fall damage, push people or outplays like Mitr0 shockwaving himself down for the Victory Royale

Bad players basically just used them to not die by the storm.

We will then be reapproving each meme again after Tuesday is over so you can be able to go back and view each mean if you want. 

Next week we will be trying out one bog megathread. So keep in mind that next week we will only be allowing memes being posted in the stickied megathread that we will throw up.

But why do so many of the additions have to be so annoying? Let's go through a few examples.

1. Planes. The new vehicle of the season. Used to be overpowered, but Epic have done a good job of nerfing them. But still, all the damn time, a plane will fly into my build battle trying to third-party, and they make rotations so easy that there are 20 people alive by the first circle *at most*.

2. Boom Box. Man, these things are awful. No one would carry one in their hotbar. But they are so damn *annoying*. The only time they ever get used is at the start of the game when people throw them down and destroy the whole building you landed on. Not OP, just a pain in the neck.

3. Balloons. Now these are annoying for a different reason. They are fucking *everywhere!* I don't want to find balloons in every 2nd chest I open. They are honestly a fun gimmicky item, but please, the loot pool is so diluted and I am always desperate for shields at the start of the game. Stop giving me damn balloons!

4. Quad Launcher. Splodes are still super strong, but are in an *okay* state. Except for this thing. Again, I wouldn't call it OP, but it's just a pain in the ass. The rockets are piss weak so there isn't a good chance they will kill you with it directly, but four rockets in quick succession means your entire defense is gone, and you are in the open for everyone in the area to take pings at. Combine the QL with balloons though... dear god. It's not necessarily OP either (they are a sitting duck in the air) but it is just so frustrating to deal with. 

The loot pool is so diluted already. If you are going to add things Epic, you need to be vaulting more frequently, and *please* stop adding items that are so annoying. ",FortniteCompetitive

I know that we have no idea how good or bad it is. But I'm just saying, why is there a NEED to add more items into Fortnite. 

I understand Epic wants to keep things new and fresh and whatnot, but adding more items to the game adds zero value. In my opinion there's too many items in the game.

Balloons? Quadlauncher? Boombox?? I don't understand. These items are all unnessesary. 

I will give them credit for vaulting the Grey/Green/Blue burst rifle and decreasing the number of AR's in the game. In my opinion the next step is to remove other completely UNNESSESARY items. Why do we need a quadlauncher when there's already RPG, GL, Dynamite, Grenades, Stinks?? Why do we need so many splodes. Why do we need a Hunting Rifle, Silenced sniper, Heavy sniper, and bolt?? It's just not needed, at least in my opinion

How many of Epic's aditions have really added value to the game and made it ""better""? I'd say not many. Many of their aditions have either lowered the skill gap, been useless, or been too overpowered (Infinity blade, Chillers, Quadlauncer, ect...)

I completely understand the concept of keeping things new and fresh; i appreciate epic for trying to do so, but in my mind new weapons aren't the answer. And i know that we haven't seen this new weapon yet, but I already can't picture many people utilizing it in their loadout, unless it ends up being overpowered.

Let me know what you think. Are there too many unnessesary weapons in the game? ",FortniteCompetitive

Video games weren't a part of my childhood, but in my adult years, I enjoy playing recreationally. I love fortnite, and I practice quite a bit because I love the competitive nature of the game. That being said, I kinda suck... Or maybe it's just that the players in pub matches are, on average, very skilled. 

Not only do I come across people in every game who absolutely stomp all over me, but I've also  noticed a concerning trend in YouTube content. Content creators will upload videos where they lose the game, or don't even place top 5, just to stay on top of their upload schedules. Several months ago, uploaders would always have games where they had high kill victories, but now there is a trend of videos featuring high kill losses. I think it showcases the fact that the player base has evolved to a new level overall. 

As someone who wants to be really good at the game, it's somewhat frustrating, but at the same time, the challenge to always improve is what draws me in. With the exception of certain awful season 7 changes, I hope the game keeps on its current path, because the result is a truly engaging, entertaining passtime.",FortniteCompetitive

I say this for two reasons: squads and explosives. Even though they know most people would not be playing it in squads they still released it in squads. They can never give us exactly what we want. There was so much love for the last siphon Ltm but they just had to go and change it up, for no reason really. It was still really fun to play solo squads but I feel like epic made it squads to make it seem less enjoyable to people. 

I also feel like epic attempted to make this LTM less appealing by increasing the explosive spawn rate dramatically. I dropped in doghouse in salty and got 9 dynamite and three grenades, but no gun. It was rare that I would land in tilted and not hear someone immediately cooking dynamite getting ready to destroy an entire building.

&gt; I have recently been banned/blacklisted from every scrim server and this is why. Yesterday, when I ""Dofus"" and my duo partner ""Harry"" played  in the duo qualifiers we came into a fight with RazZzero0o and its\_x8. We had just fought another duo and taken their aircraft and noticed that either RazZzero0o or its\_x8 edited a window, shot at us, and then edited it back. So then we noticed that their turtle spot was in a really good spot and it would be logical for us if we attacked them. We did. We had a fair fight and killed them. Later, we were accused of stream sniping because I had 4 kills and had twitch in my name and the reason I had twitch in my name is because I recently ordered a new PC and wanted to start streaming but I currently do not have a twitch account. We died shortly after, and were promptly blacklisted for stream sniping.  Hope someone can help 📷

OK.. Not sure where to start but lets get into it

Im a console player who has been playing since season two, im very competetive and always trying to improve my gameplay. So is my duo partner who started playing in season 3, ive known him for 4 years trough gaming. (we didnt play fortnite together before season 5)

So this is the thing.. Im not here to say im the best out of all my friends just hear me out..

When we started playing fortnite together he werent really good at the game at all, bad aim, bad desicion making and bad building, soo.. After months of grinding duos and playgrounds with him he has gotten alot better.

Then the pop up cups finally got released and we were stoked to be given this chance to play more competetive, my friend bought a pc, monitor and a scuf controller because he wanted to take it more seriously. After that his aim has improved soooo much and im happy for him, but he is becoming more and more toxic for everyday that goes..

Let me give you guys an example - my friend has NEVER EVER been able to out kill me if we had a friendly competition in duos or squads.. but latley ive only been playing scrims and pop up cups so whenever I play regular pubs with him I play way more passive than before causing to him get more kills than me because im not just rushing everyone I see to get in a shotgun/buildfight i'd rather sit back and dink people with my ak / deagle.

After every game since season 7 he will ask how many kills I got and if he has more than me he starts acting like a toxic toddler, saying shit like 'remember when you used to be good' etc etc.. I have tried to explain to him just because you get the last hit on a guy dosent really mean its ur kill, lol.. You can check damage done to players after everygame and we can messure whos peen is bigger if you really want to after every single game.. Or we can drop on the opposite side of the map and see whos doing better. Guess whos dying in the first everytime when we do tho.. 

And yeah.. Everytime we done duo scrims or duo pop up cups he ALWAYS dies first. Why you ask? Because he wants to rush everyone he sees for a shotgun/buildfight and im here trying to practice for end game scenarios

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, ive never really understood people who talk shit on people with TTV  or GAMING in their name.

This guy is one of these people.. Even tho he has YT in his own name, a name that he basicly copied of another big streamer and added yt behind it 

&amp;#x200B;

Dont know where I was going with this.. 

I think I need a new duo partner because im done with this toxic ass kid. I just want to play competetive and have fun!",FortniteCompetitive

So back on topic, first off I will say aim assist it not op but can be cheesy. I play controller on console and PC and I can say that LT or L2 spamming takes no skill, but I use it because it is an advantage. My aim without spamming LT or L2 is still above average. Other than LT/L2 spamming it's not that big of an advantage. I've played on friends PCs and always wished I had one so I could flick and play with the smoothness of a mouse. Aiming on thumbsticks is inherently worse be logic and science. This is why most games implement aim assist in the first place. To sum it up LT/L2 spamming is takes no skill and should be removed from the game but aim assist as a whole isn't a bad concept or game mechanic.",FortniteCompetitive

* Challenge for a weapon off drop

I see players doing this all too often. It's never worth dying to try to get a certain weapon early game - you're looking at a 50/50 choice, this lowers your win rate a ton. 

* Challenging high ground when you have no mobility items

Sometimes you have to play low ground, especially if the other player is continuously outbuilding you. Eventually they'll get enough space between them and you to get a clean shot off and then the fight is over. Stay below, stay in cover, reset fights when you need to.

* Pushing for kills at the loss of good positioning

Why are you moving off the mountain for a kill when you're already strapped with gear? Another great way to give up a game, looting in this game isn't even super important as long as you have shields. Have an AR and a Shotgun? You're well on your way to victory. Understandably some people just want to get kills to pub-stomp for fun, but even if pop-ups I see people do this. Placement and the Victory Royale are worth more points than one more kill, it's not worth it if you're lowering your odds of winning by another 50%.

Second, during the game you hear them talking about Faze, which of course features the man himself: 72hrs with cloakzy, SpaceLyon and Jaomock. Third, they finish the scrim by pickaxing Hamlinz. Lots of other little crazy things in the video that sort of blows your mind knowing what we know now.

The map changes are a trip as well, seeing the old Dusty Depot is something that always gives me a bit of nostalgia.

I switched to PC w/ controller this week after playing Fortnite for around a year on Xbox. First PC and the build went great, PC worked right away, etc .The game feels AMAZING at 144 fps. So fluid compared to Xbox it is honestly unreal. Building especially feels totally different. On Xbox it almost felt like you had to slow down your building to a certain rhythm to make it work whereas building on PC feels much more responsive. I drop tilted a high percentage of my games and no shadows is amazing. Another huge game changer. It's much easier to see opponents in environments that are normally rather dark on xbox.

The frames and no shadows alone have made me a significantly more effective player. I at least feel like I'm able to slay out quite a bit more. (Can't wait for next pop-ups!)

***Competition***

Competition wise the players overall may be better though I wouldn't say going from console to pc is a massive transition. Many players can build/edit better on PC and I find myself losing high ground quite often (though I've never been great at high ground). I've ran into a few insanely botty bots in PC lobbies, like people who seem to have difficulty aiming/moving, something I rarely saw in console lobbies. I have run into great players more often than on console, though the average (majority of) players on pc don't seem to necessarily be better than the average (majority of) players on console. And at certain times of day (lateish night NA-East) the lobbies DO actually seem substantially higher skill-wise than console. My kd right now is actually a bit higher on PC than on console after 195 games (3.47) though its not the largest sample size and I don't know how much k/d really says about the player. 

**Keyboard and Mouse?**

I'll be trying keyboard and mouse once my long ethernet cable comes so I can move my pc onto a surface where I can put a mousepad and keyboard and am unsure if I'll ultimately switch over. I'm not really trying to be the best or anything so I'm unsure if it's worth it. I guess we'll see! Sharing about any experiences switching would be helpful!

**Thoughts to those Considering Switching**

It's definitely not cheap once you add up all the parts, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc. so I understand not wanting to switch though I will say I would find it hard to see anyone being able to go back to console after playing on a decent PC. I was almost nervous about having to play in PC lobbies as I was under the impression they were much more difficult, but I think a lot of that is mental. There are certainly some absolutely dirty players in PC lobbies but its not like they're everywhere and there are still lots of average players and bots. 

I also didn't want to switch because all my friends are on xbox, but with cross platform and the xbox app on windows 10, you can play fort and still be in xbox parties with friends who aren't playing fort. Obviously many other games don't have cross platform so you're kinda beat there. 

The people on r/buildmeapc and r/buildapcforme can help you pick out pc parts if you want to go the building route, which is way easier than you'd imagine. It took me a few hours and I have never done anything like that, though I did have to return 3 parts and order different ones as I basically ordered the parts right when I got the list then did research, picked out some different parts and had to order those. So, I'd maybe do a week or two of research first and think about what you really want before you start ordering parts.

Overall I have no regrets and am super stoked to play on pc and would highly recommend it to anyone who's been on the fence for awhile and has the money.

This is a quote from one of the patch notes back in June last year. So currently, 6 months after that was stated by epic, the only rewarding play style is cold dropping, looting the entire game and avoiding every single engagement until it's a 1v1 situation when playing for the win. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epic also stated in the same patch notes, ""It's important to support a variety of late game strategies, that don't boil down to just build lol."" In a game with so much rng that 90% of the time either you or your opponent has an advantage in some way, having the ability to defend yourself and outplay the other player is a necessity. Currently, the only way to really do that is to just build lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

If epic really wants to implement a variety of supported play styles, one way to do so is to add shield per kill into all default modes. This rewards an aggressive play style, while still giving passive players the advantage as it is definitely safer and more likely that cold droppers find extra shield to hold onto. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know many people think adding shield per kill will give better players a bigger advantage over 'casual' players as worse players rely on better players having less health/shield during fights. However, I do believe that by adding shield per kill, all players are rewarded. Since most players take a significant amount of damage during fights, anyone who comes in to clean up knows that they're in a huge advantage, but with shield per kill in the game, it's possible that a player is put into a better position than they were before they engaged in a fight, making it harder for third parties to clean up. This rewards all players, good and bad as you are given a good chance to kill the new player who had emerged from the bushes.

It’s sort of a predicament to nerf, as having a reload speed would make it garbage and giving it five charges would also make it garbage.

The best way to nerf it is by punishing people who miss their shot with it.

So, if you try to grapple to nothing, OR you miss your grapple shot up to a building, a charge should be removed. This would make people be more careful with the grappler and time their shots so it isn’t mindless grappling up to a building.

This clip apparently triggered a lot of PC players and I feel like people are either A) misinformed or B) directing their negative energy towards the wrong groups. I’d like to have a genuine discussion about the discussion, so if you’re interested please continue reading.

First, I’d like to state that I am a controller player. I’ve followed the “competitive” scene wherever the competition has gone; started on Xbox, moved to the PS4 Pro, and now I play on PC with a controller. Next, I like to touch on the two points I made above;

A) The clip Mongraal lasering players does not paint a proper picture of aim assist IMO. Those shots were absolute BEAMS, regardless of the amount of controller experience the kid has. I have enough experience on both console and PC to confidently say that PC players have more accurate assault rifle shots. They connect way more shots from range, while you’re gliding, while you’re on planes, etc. PC players see a clip like this and immediately forget the numerous advantages of KB&amp;M that are rarely addressed. If you’d like some examples, please comment below.

B) Epic decided right off the bat that competitive Fortnite would be cross-platform. There were NUMEROUS posts with decent traction stating how console and PC should have separate tournaments. At that time, the gap between PC and controller players was extreme and PC players basically said, “suck it up or switch to M&amp;KB.” So after a while of lagging behind and realizing this wouldn’t change, many console players switched to PC with a controller. Now with the addition of instant building, custom binds, etc. Controller players can compete much easier than before. I honestly believe if the PC players said, “you know what, I believe that controller/console players should be separate,” right off the bat then we wouldn’t be forced to play competitively against each other with different inputs. 

There’s A LOT of hate towards controller players right now on this sub with some even saying we should have our own sub. I just wanted to say that it’s not our fault that we’ve been forced to compete against you guys. We’ve just adapted. If people are THAT concerned with controller players, direct the negative energy towards a thoughtful post detailing why they should be separate instead of a hateful one saying we are using a built in aim bot.

I tend to agree, and so do the majority of the people here, [according to the upvote count](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/af8v05/please_take_rocket_launchers_out_of_chest/).

However, the second paragraph of this thread had me kind of confused:

&gt;Don't get me wrong RNG should be in this game you shouldn't land get 4 minis a pump SMg and an AR every single time.

... Really? Why? I can't see anything wrong with that, but on the contrary. Why would you want RNG in this game? No one in the thread has addressed this, which is why I feel like it warrants a different thread.

I can't seem to understand what's so obvious and a given about that? What's wrong with chests having no RNG and containing said items in them? Obviously it'd be an issue because we need a source to distribute the rest of the loot pool (which can be found on the floor or whatever), but let's leave technicality aside - why wouldn't you want less RNG with chests?

What if every single check would contain: HP/Shield med, Shotgun, Ar. Again - just hypothetically (because we'd still need source for the rest of the weapons and items), wouldn't you actually prefer that over the current system? At least then, you'd know that upon opening a chest, you're guaranteed these items.

The less RNG there is, the better a competitive game (or one which aspires to be one) becomes.",FortniteCompetitive

**Preface**: This is Xbox. EU servers. Solos. I used replay mode to look at all gamertags. Roughly 4 per lobby could not be found as they had not linked. I rotated 1 solo on each account to account for time of day. Done between 1pm and 11pm on a Friday and 9-11am on Saturday morning. Thanks to my friend who grinds solos I could do this on his account, I suck at them so half credit goes to SeanS for letting me trash his stats. 

Account 1: 950ish wins, 30% WR, 4.4KD. Nothing pro worthy but a good public player. 

Account 2: 0 wins. From 0-25 games. 0 kills. Straight suicide at the start of every game. 

-------

**Averages over 25 solo games**

#Good account: (6 wins from 25)

Average solo KD: 1.21

Average overall KD: 1.61

Average solo wins: 33

Average overall wins: 80

Average solo win %: 0.57%

Average overall win %: 2.3%

Average Amount of players with 0 solo wins per game: 3.5PG



#Bad account: (0KD, 0 wins, level 0)

Average solo KD: 1.33

Average overall KD 1.60

Average solo wins: 31

Average overall wins: 78

Average solo win %: 0.60%

Average overall win %: 1.98%

Average Amount of players with 0 solo wins (Not including this account: 4PG 

------------

**Comments**:
Over the 25 games just like last time I found no difference between a total bot account and a good pub stomper, scrim level player. However, the average stats since last time (click the link above) for both have risen. Which does add weight to games being harder, but also weight to the fact that the average player is now more capable of winning a game. There were some extreme outliers (I actually matched with someone in the top 30 of leaderboards players on the main) But also someone who has played 2600 games with 0 wins. Which while not in the same game is evidence that they could be in the same lobby. One outlier on the bot account was a game with 7 players with over 400 solo wins, 5 of which had over 600. Which from the stats was an insane level of competition.

--------

**conclusion and TL;DR**

Lobbies are still getting harder but that's due to the potatos we all know and love getting better. There is no evidence from what I looked at to say there has been any skill based match making changes.

&gt;We were approached by Kenneth (Baldy) and Stephen (Gunfly) and they made it clear to us they wanted to play with other duo partners. Being that we feel strongly about any competitive Fortnite players for OpTic playing as the same duo, we didn’t think it was fair to punish them or stand in the way of what they felt was best for their own success. Essentially giving them the option of staying as one duo or parting ways.  
&gt;  
&gt;They decided to part ways, and we released them from their contracts on good terms all around. We really do wish them nothing but success and are thankful for their maturity and understanding.

Is it because posts calling for customised crosshairs never gained enough traction to reach the front page in /r/fortnitebr? Or does Epic think players having customised crosshairs will impact viewer experience negatively?

The rpg shotgun strat with all the normie bois was already annoying as hell. But with the addition of the quad launcher bunny hoppers can just spam the QL and not get punished for it. 

Splodes, as many pros have talked about, are already so strong that we don’t need more. I played a match last night where I ran into 3 people with QL’s. They all spammed it and were a huge pain in the ass, but also they don’t get punished for using such a dangerous play style. Players that use QLs as shotties don’t take as much damage as they should. 

All players that use RPGs, and QLs should have a self-splash damage multiplier. Meaning that if someone who uses splodes isn’t careful, and they hit themselves with it, they should receive massive damage, if not fatal. 

It’s a joke that people are a allowed to run around with RPGs and QLs and use them as their all purpose weapon and get away with it. It’s just stupid, bad game design, and unacceptable. 

Splodes should be a utility in this game, to reset fights and break down large structures and build fights. Yes you should be allowed to get kills with them, but not primarily barrel stuff a wall with it and take 80 damage, “oopsie” and just keep bunny hopping with your big boomstick. 

Everyone in this game has to consider their altitude and be cautious about fall damage. Fall damage isn’t used as a weapon or anything, it’s just an in game mechanic that relies on the player to make a mistake. Splodes should act the same way. A great tool for pressuring players and taking down high ground. But if you hit yourself and aren’t careful? Back to the lobby. ",FortniteCompetitive

The only way to stop yourself being sniped out of no where is to constantly build and we all know that’s not possible if we want to have mats for small circles late game. The heavy sniper does far too much damage, if I’m on 150 health I’m thinking that I’m going to have a fair chance in any fight, but if I stand still for a single second when getting first bullet on someone there’s a chance that another player 200m away will just snipe me in one bullet. As well as this the suppressed sniper encourages people to hide and take shots at everyone. It’s very possible hat you won’t know where you’re being shot from until the snipe actually connects with you. I just think it adds so much randomness to the game to the point that I’d rather they remove snipers than planes and boom boxes so that I’m able to peak without being worried that someone will snipe me across the map",FortniteCompetitive

&gt;Edit: Was just informed it was a bug, not a new feature... can you tell I didn't read the whole thread? Anyway, thanks for bringing it up, will be fixed next week.

&amp;nbsp;

[Framerate] What framerate do you get on your system?,"My PC has trouble to keep the game on 144 fps (locked) on lowest settings when there is something going on like building or every fight i get into.
My specs:
GTX 1080
I7-6700k OC to 4.8 GHz (watercooled)
32 Gb RAN
I just saw a video on youtube about fortnite played on the 1080 and the minimum fps on highest setting where over 100.

So i think there might be something going on with my system, but i have no clue where to start searching for the issue.

If anyone has an idea, i would be very happy! 

And what system do you use and what framerates do you get, would like to compare it with mine.

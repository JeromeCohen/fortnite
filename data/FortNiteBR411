If it's Epic then you can only use them as casual binoculars to see people across the map. If it's Legendary then it could have the night vision (green) and maybe the ability to see players in red color (body temp). I think this would be a nice addition towards the competitive scene since you'll have roles such as: sniper, rifler, shotgun/pusher and a medic/info guy. I haven't really put very much effort on this, but it could be balanced by forcing the player to stand still. ",FortNiteBR

(PC),"I've really enjoyed the game, and wish it wasn't true but I only enjoy playing squads and usually only have one or two friends online. As to not take an immediate disadvantage we always play with fill on and we have got matched with so many great players, entertaining personalities, and even people who've taught us how to play better. 

But in the past few days a new pattern has happened. We continually get put into squads that have the intent of joining, killing their team, then leaving. Some act like they don't know how to play, some act like they killed you on accident, some claim that there was an enemy that killed you, and some don't even say anything. They just follow you until they can kill you and then disconnect once you are dead.

I wish I enjoyed solos or duos more but I really just don't. I'm not saying everyone should quit the game, I'm just saying that this is a problem that made me quit. Hopefully Epic is on it and issuing bans and hopefully this doesn't happen to any of you.

29,DumbTwitchMain,1515805794,7q1b16,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7q1b16/please_no_killcams/,0,Please NO Killcams,"I created this *discussion* because people felt the need to downvote my post simply because I disagreed with the implementation of kill cams. Here are my reasons:

1. Why have silenced weapons? As of today (1/12/18) there are two silenced weapons, and one of which is the Silenced SMG which is not used as a long-range weapon. With only the Silenced Pistol to be worried about from long range and not know where the attacker is, killcams would A. Dilute the point of silenced weapons when there is, again, only one of which to actually be worried about and B. Defeat the point of them, as they are silenced for a reason.

2. This is utterly unnecessary; I play this game everyday and if I'm being shot at, then I can see where I'm being shot at from the following weapons: M16 (Default Assault Rifle), Burst Rifle, Scoped-AR, Scar, RPG, Grenade (Snowball) Launcher, SMG (Default), Tactical SMG, Pistol, Revolver, Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle, and the Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle. Though the two rocket weapons don't explicitly show which direction it comes from, the audio and where you actually see the rockets coming from is a fairly clear indication of where the attacker is. For every other weapon, an arrow pops up on the screen to show where the shots are coming from, and if for some reason you don't build at least four walls of wood around you and you die, then that's your fault.

3. This seems like an excuse; No matter how much I look around this sub-Reddit and see the ridiculous suggestions, the comments are usually the same: There was one post about having auto-switching materials when you're under ten of said material, and the comments said a lot of the same things; that this would lower the skill gap and make things easier when they shouldn't change. The fact that no one has this same opinion on killcams leaves me scratching my head. Though this wouldn't exactly lower the skill gap, this would just make it easier to give exact callouts in Squads or even Duos. The only positive that I can think of for this update would be the fact that you could learn angles in Solos by just spectating the person who killed you.

Okay, so why in the world would we want something like this? Besides my opinion, please share yours and please have the decency to not downvote because you dislike or disagree with someone (says right on the button) and keep it civil. Please excuse repeats or typos, as this was all typed on my phone and I have a fever and just woke up from a nap.

EDIT: And now my post is getting downvoted. Anyone who did, just please explain why they have to blatantly disregard everything I asked",FortNiteBR

I was permanently banned about a week ago on Fortnite and had my account removed which was completely legit and never cheated on. I was around level 36 with some really disappointing stats. (hey it's a tough game) Now, I know that at least half of you would dismiss me as a cheater and you can feel free although my stats beg to differ. 

Whether you believe I cheated or not, we need to bring attention to the support system at Epic Games / Fortnite. The message I received when I enquired on the ban was nothing  more than an automated message which addressed absolutely none of my concerns. 

&gt;Bans for any reason are not issued unless they are rightfully warranted.

&gt;Due to internal security policy (and the protection of our software) we cannot disclose the methods that are used to identify any infraction.

&gt;Your ban will not be overturned, and any further contact in regards to this matter will be closed, and locked.

When innocent people like myself are being wrongfully banned at the fault of Epic Games and BattlEye, tickets should be dealt with reasonably considering this isn't the first time users have been [wrongfully banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/750m9a/false_positive_with_our_cheat_detection/?utm_content=full_comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) and treated extremely poorly by the support robots. Support should be just that, users creating tickets shouldn't be met with an automated message only to be ignored from then on without ever speaking to a human. 

EDIT: Let me just add something here, this isn't a witchhunt thread and I don't intend for other people to start listing their accounts and asking for themselves to be unbanned, I am just asking for a conversation on the unacceptable problem. This is clearly a controversial issue, but I ask that you folks try not to downvote as it’s an important topic and definitely adds to the subreddit and overall quality of user experience.",FortNiteBR

Probably 20 games and 50 chests go by with nothing but grey SMGs or a Green AR (if it's burst, forget about it).  I'm very confident in saying I pick up the majority of the better weapons just lying on the ground.  A while back, 2 games pretty close to each other had gold SCARs spawn on the roof and every chest in the building gave grey garbage.

It seems like it should be the other way around.  I find soooo many dang grey weapons in chests it's ridiculous.  Kind of misleading in a way to have a ""treasure"" chest give loot worse than what's literally sitting on the floor elsewhere.  It's already a gamble to find a chest in your house, you should at least feel as though you'll find something useful instead of yet another gamble if you're going to get a grey smg and wood.


It just seems like chests don't really have much distinction anymore to me.  I don't get excited when I find one.  I don't have any reason too.  There is a very good chance the weapons sitting on the ground are far better.  I'm just wondering if anyone else thinks Glowing, glistening, and twinkling chests with beautiful golden light of loot spilling out beckoning you to open with a sweet serene sound of treasure should have more than a grey SMG in it.",FortNiteBR

We finally launched Gamer Queue, it's a new website to help with finding teammates. It's a soft beta so we're looking for feedback, and will be adding more features shortly. 

I play fortnite on PS4 and PC and not a huge of fan of solos but always have a hard time finding duos and squads that coordinate, hopefully, this can help.

Just register, Fill out your profile, and select fortnite as your main game. ( you can add any game if you play other games as well) and then head to the ""Queue"" Feed which is where you'll search for groups or post a group yourself, make sure your correct platform you play on is selected ( will filter users and posts by this). Any game you add to your profile, you can then swap between ANY game you've added using the quick tray in the top right.

Appreciate any support, and any questions feel free to message me on the site or on here!

It's a little awkward just because we don't have a ton of users yet, but we're more looking for general feedback so we can improve, however, feel free to post if you're looking for some teammates.

Cheers!

That was yesterday and no changes have been made to the Battle Pass strcutre, so this remains true. 

The **TL;DR** is that there is no way for you to earn enough stars to level up your Battle Pass to max level if you purchase the pass any time from today through the end of the season (feb 20th). You will have to purchase additional v-bucks to finish leveling up if you want the Black Knight. 

This is because the vast bulk of the stars are earned through daily challenges (10 per day aka 1 tier per day). As outlined in my previous post, as of today there are not enough daily challenges moving fowards to get you to 70, EVEN if you grinded enough to reach season level 100 in the remaining days and reinvested all vbucks earned from the Battle Pass, you would not be able to reach tier 70 as the stars earned are still too few to get you there.

I just wanted to post this to alert those who were on the fence about buying or were questioning their ability to get the Black Knight. The most important thing to stay on top of if you want the Black Knight is doing your daily challenges.

Personally, I think the Battle Pass was a great value this season and wouldn't mind seeing a similar structure for future seasons. Now is a great time to have our voices heard on how we would like to see it changed in the future. The biggest change I would like to see is that ranking up season level should reward more stars as you get deeper into the level progression. I think the levels ending in 5 and 0 should continue to award 5 and 10 stars respectively, but I think the first level digit should dictate how many stars you get on other levels. For example:

Season level | Stars Earned 
:-- | :--
1-20 | 1
21-40 | 2
41-60 | 3
61-80 | 4
81-100 | 5

Please share your thoughts on the season pass too! I'm interested in what the community thinks about the Battle Pass and I'm sure Epic is too.

Edit: This is assuming an account buys the pass today with no progress on it already. If you're already past tier 20 you should have no trouble if you just continue to play enough to do your daily challenges. 

38 tiers are available to earn after today from daily challenges. You can reinvest v-bucks earned from the pass for another 8 tiers, so thats 46 tiers you can 100% count on, plus you will be earning some stars for leveling up your season rank as well. ",FortNiteBR

92,SpaZtiK6,1515755616,7pvxq8,31,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7pvxq8/21_bugissues_compilation/,50,2.1 Bug/Issues Compilation,"Hey Reddit, just thought I'd jump on and list a few bugs and issues my friends and I have run into during our time with this patch on PC. Some of these have been issues for awhile now, and a few feel like they've come up recently in this patch, but I thought I'd compile a list of things that perhaps even you've run into during your course of playing the game. If they're able to be fixed or not, I still have enjoyed playing this game and look forward to it feeling really fluid and consistent for higher levels of playing. Especially since I'd love to see this game grow into an eSport.

**When a friend pulls out a shotgun, the audio is played on the opposite side of you.**

* This one has thrown me off so much and easily reproducible. Have a friend stand on either your left or right and have them switch between pulling out any other gun and a shotgun. The sound will play on your exact opposite side.

**Unable to loot for a few seconds after killing an enemy.**

* This one happens about 1 out of 5 games, where you're locked out of actually picking up the loot an enemy dropped.

**Possibly in relation to the second point, placing a structure where you killed an enemy registers as if someone is inside of it, and you will clip through it.**

* This has happened only once to me, but after taking out an enemy I built 4 metal walls quickly to heal but was able to move through the wall that was placed on his point of death until it was fully formed.

**Large trees (the ones mostly found in Wailing Woods) have hit boxes very far beneath the leaves, blocking structures and absorbing bullets.**

* Similar to the hanging vines from the trees in Moisty Mire, there are inconsistent hit boxes underneath those trees that have caused my rockets to explode in my face or block structures that wouldn't interfere with the visible design of those trees.

**Structure placement doesn't register where the indicator shows.**

* Common issues with this is when you place multiple ramps in a row. If you time your clicks, sometimes it will not register your placement and if you're running while building you'll fall down. It forces you to mash your clicks in case the game misses that placement window. It feels worse when the indicator is on the tile in front of you, but clicking it causes it to build the tile further away.

**Shotgun inconsistency.**

* This is probably the most frustrating part of the game. In one of my tests, standing completely still and having my target standing still with a common pump shotgun 1 tile away registered 76 in the upper body and 21 in the head. These guns are necessary because of their one-shot potential and because they beat every gun within their range. What's feels so bad about them is that they can get you 150 damage from 3 tiles away or 8 damage. They don't seem to follow any specific rules, and that inconsistency usually leaves a bad taste in that person's mouth who's died from them and ""wow that's ridiculous"" from someone who's killed a person. They just feel bad in general.

**Pressing Cursor Mode (the quick inventory button) sometimes closes the inventory page and causes your character to freeze.**

* This bug is rare. You can't build, shoot, or even move for about 5-10 seconds but you can rotate your camera. Usually what happens is it triggers the issue when dragging around weapons or resources, then triggers the rest of the game when pressing cursor mode.

**After changing music volume settings, when loading the game the music is at full volume for a few seconds before lowering to your setting.**

* Not a gameplay bug, but I thought I'd bring it up. Maybe setting the default music volume to half before reading the user settings would help.

**Dying to a spike trap caused my spectator camera to not follow anyone, staying stationary until the final person won.**

* This only happened 1 game, but it was strange that my kill feed didn't show my death until about 2 seconds later and watching the final two people fight from a different camera perspective.

**Still seem to get small hitches/hiccups around shotguns.**

* This issue wasn't as bad as 3 or 4 patches ago, where hitching would happen in intervals, scoping with a sniper, and a handful of other times. I still seem to get from time to time in shotgun fights. It's just enough to feel bad in a jumping shotgun fight, especially since I think shotguns feel bad in general at the moment.

**Switching between traps since the trap update is right click, but the HUD says pressing T will change the trap.**

* Mostly just a clarity issue. I still run into people who don't know how to swap between spike traps and jump pads.

**Some ammo crates still get stuck in the shelf or comes out on the floor above.**

* Thought I'd list this, not sure the official response on this one.

**After placing a trap, pressing the Build Mode button brings up your traps again instead of a wall.**

* This has gotten me a few times when trying to build quick walls for protection.

**Spike traps can miss, and seem to have a long delay if you build them on the same tile as an enemy.**

* I'm not sure if spike trap damage be avoided is intentional, but I had one instance where the trap animation was hitting the enemy model but did no damage. It's also frustrating when you trap a surface that an enemy is occupying and it seems to go off way after it does it's ""preparation"" sound.


----- **Submitted bugs/issues** -----

* All footsteps audio has be increased this patch.
* The Fatal Fields glitch where you can go under the map. ([Video](https://clips.twitch.tv/PuzzledSavageWormTriHard)) ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNjkglOmN8w))",FortNiteBR

So I started PS4 version of Fortnite few weeks ago. As I have flexible job, I play a lot at times when not many friends are online, thus I play squad quite a lot. 

Last two days were horrible regarding comunity experience tho. 
I didnt have much luck in solos so I decided to play some duo/squad with random people. 

In 4 out of 5 games I get teamkilled or attempted-to. And its really frustrating, because the games I dont get teamkilled, usually at least one guy who is falling behind in the group attempts to at some point and then I have to waste my ammo/health/shield to deal with this s**t. Last night, 3 people from my squad were chasing me good 5 minutes. 

So to not just whine and cry, let me propose a solution I alredy wrote in some thread and hopefully, the message will get to someone out there as I hope I am not the only one frustrated by this. 

SOLUTION: 
Right now, I dont have much to do. If I get killed, I usually report the player and thats it, he ruined the game for me, I lost 15 minutes of my time and I should just play on another game. 

Why not to put BASIC option, to kill the player who killed you? 

''You have been killed by your team-mate, do you want to punish him in the same way?"" 

It would solve a lot, If you accidentally shot your friend, you would just heal him up. When you really kill your team-mate, its with clear purpose and then , the player should not be able to just continue with your loot. With this option, you can punish the player equally and my guess is, people would think twice before doing something stupid in the future. 

What do you think? Do you have the same problems, or maybe its just me?

TLDR:
I get teamkilled a lot in duos/squad with random people. 
Why not to put a option to kill the teammate who killed you, to punish them in the same way? ",FortNiteBR

I really want that black knight, but I don’t think I’m going to get it. I just bought the season pass yesterday (I no wanna wish I bought it earlier but I didn’t know anything about it or this subreddit until a few days ago), I’m lvl 41, tier 17. I feel like that’s far too low. This is what I think I know so far:

You get 1 star each time you level up, 5 when it ends in a 5, 10 when it ends in a 0, 10 stars make 1 tier. I’m tier 17 and there’s 38 days left now which means the dailies would bring me to only tier 55. What else can I do aside from playing or spendings a ton? I’m not great, but I think I’m decent, and therefore I don’t level up as fast as others. I’d also have around 1,000 V-bucks when I get to tier 55, which means at 150 V-bucks/tier I can get to tier 61.

Can someone help me out on my math here to see if this sounds about right based on me currently being lvl 41/tier 17 with now 38 days left? ",FortNiteBR

Most of us were pumped when you first announced the Cozy Campfire last week.  Now that we've tried it for a few days, most of us are livid.

The Cozy Campfire needs to have smoke coming out of it to alert nearby players of its location.   Balance this how you want but a good starting point would be a 3 story tall smoke stack.

The Cozy Campfire needs to have, at the absolute minimum, a 60 second duration.  25 seconds is simply way too short to get much counterplay from it.  There's simply not enough time to react to it as an attacker.

The Cozy Campfire needs to heal for 1hp/second, not 2hp/second.  

The Cozy Campfire needs to be able to heal enemies too.  I think this is just a bug but the current CC doesn't heal enemies.

That is the rework we're looking for.

Fortnite is at it's best when we have to react to the world.  The current basic CC doesn't provide a multitude of experiences.  The reworked CC (above) gives players who use it, and players who go up against it a variety of interesting decisions to make when it's in play.

Make the Cozy Campfire great.  

Sincerely, 

The entire FN community",FortNiteBR

Seeing a few FortNite gameplay videos of a youtuber go victorious compelled me to try this out (how hard can it be, right?!) 

My first match was a total wash. Dropped in, someone beat me to one of the loot houses, got dropped with a sniper rifle. New lobby.

The second game, I figured I'd wait till I was over a more secluded area and drop in for some loot. An assault rifle, supplies, and ammo? Sounds good (Spent literally 8 minutes trying to figure out how to use the bandages and shield potion LOL). I played it safe for the most part avoiding conflict and just went cover to cover staying close to the middle of the eye. Had a few firefights due to those around the corner enemy surprises but I always got lucky with the first draw. Btw, I had NO idea how to ""build"" during this match so I only utitlized map cover and other player's bases (kinda didn't wanna risk learning so late into the game). 

When it came down to the last two players, I had a legendary pistol (many thanks to the youtuber who noted how beast that weapon is). Killed the third place guy trying to build a min-fort. Snuck up on the second place guy thinking he had the drop on me. Victory Royale! *near desk flip from standing up yelling ""OMG""*

TL;DR Winning first for a second ever match had me almost flip over my desk. Not only did I win first, I didn't even utilize the build mechanic! (which I found out is pretty darn cool and a life saver obviously) I can totally see why people love this genre now.

However, getting killed by a cheating player can be particularly infuriating. Many of us, myself included, just want to have fun and players like CEEZ are getting UNFAIR advantages.

Let me clarify myself.

Are you aware that CDNthe3rd is in the possession of a telephone with a DIRECT LINE to epic games?

Yes, just like the one rumored to be shared by Russia (or maybe it was the USSR(I play fortnite I hope you weren’t expecting a history major)) and the US during the Cold War.

And what does CEEZ do with this direct line? He simply picks up the phone and requests specific items to be dropped off for him at his convenience. MID GAME. Shield pots for example have been placed purposefully for him in places of his choosing and this has been seen by many on his (very popular) streams. 

In fact, he even has the ability to request that chests and crates drop particular items like RPGs, Pump Shotguns, etc. 

This must come to an end.

DUOS/SQUADS 

same as solos but it’s the very last time you get knocked if your teammates are still alive or when you’re last alive and get eliminated 

obviously they’d make it so you can skip the killcam if you wanted to, it’s just a thought at the moment &amp; obviously the devs would choose how/if they choose to implement it. I just feel like the game would be so much better with this simple element added to it.

-Movable shopping carts in Retail Row(any more movable items on the map)

-Separate Sensitivity for when in building mode and combat mode

-A Silenced Sniper

-New AR?

-A KSG like shotgun, possible silenced.

-I feel like the Regular SMG should have a bit less ammo, if you run into someone with it out of nowhere up close your basically dead.

-Some new Legendary Rarity Skins in the shop, some emotes etc.

-Custom Bus Music and Lobby Music(Possible able to be Earned and Bought)

-A Laser weapon would be cool, like it does slow damage in a ticking like effect or something.
Slower Night/Day cycle, i feel like it just goes by so fast, mainly the night cycle.

-a Trip Mine/Bomb related trap

-a Rating system or something, like depending on your placement, a win, and kills you will get like +1 Point on the rating, could be a better way to rank people or alternative way.

-Still waiting for that global chat thing lol

-More Named places(Points of interest) on the map Hopefully lots with the new areas coming soon

-New Grenade/Explosive 

-More Shield Potion Types, like a Large Shield Potion gives 100, Medium gives 75 or something would be cool

-Lead Potion(my Idea) like it has a 10% chance for a bullet not to hurt you, last for like 15 seconds or something.

-No team killing mode. would be nice.

I WANT THESE REALLY BAD:

-On console, no Keyboard and Mouse

-On Console, a Shaders and shadows setting

-On Consoles, Program any button to what you want



Hope some of these get into the game one day, would be cool!

I build a base every time, usually small, and I feel like I'm getting targeted by everyone else - which wouldn't happen every game, so I know that's not the problem. I'm not sure if I'm not building bases early enough, not building big enough, or not building well. I usually make a 1-block 2 high and then expand to a 3x3.

The enemy squad is all dead, they gain nothing from finishing you off they can just play another match. But you can't. 


The game is clearly geared for a more casual experience yet this mechanic seems to belong in a more hardcore game. Before all the inevitable comments saying 'git gud' I will say. Yes I fucked up, I got downed but my squad did not. It's a team focused mode. 


I say leave the bleeding out system that's fine. It adds a bit of pressure in a gunfight. But please remove being able to be killed while downed, even decrease the time it takes to bleed out to balance it.

Finding this weapon usually ends up being a waste of time and if you got it from a supply drop, means you just risked being seen by many players for garbage. Let's go over a list of basic problems that this weapon has:


- 23/24 damage per bullet (46/48 per headshot). This is just about as strong as a Common/Uncommon Pistol... So if you hit all body shots, you'd have a 5-shot kill on a 100 health opponent, and you'd have to get 6 shots off on a 125 health opponent. A common full-auto can kill a player in 4 hits at 100 and 5 hits at 125 health (It'd still be a 4-hit on 125 if it were a Rare Full-Auto)... So it's worse in terms of sheer damage to every single Assault Rifle variant out there.


- The scoped AR has a scope that allows you to precisely aim at a player, but the accuracy is still at around that of the crouched dab-shot. So... The scope doesn't really accomplish much. This gun somehow fails to find a way to be useful even when you use it for its specific purpose.


- When you look outside the scope, you have an awful hip-fire accuracy combined with a bloom that'll make using the revolver look like a sniper rifle. Even a Common, Full-Auto Burst has better hip-fire than this thing... This is to be expected to kind of limit the weapon...


Overall, the general consensus of the playerbase around this weapon is to only use it if you don't have any assault rifle (or ammo left in said rifle if you get it off the ground) at all.


How about we change this weapon into something that the community can actually enjoy when we find it? Some ideas I had were to:


- Buff damage from 23/24 --&gt; 36/37 to make each shot feel like it actually hurts. As for the Headshot/Critical multiplier, we can bring that down from 2.5x --&gt; 2.0 so we get 72/74 per critical (Headshot). This will change the Scoped AR into a 3 shot kill on a 100 health player and a 4 shot on a 125 health player. It will take about 6 shots to kill a 200 health player, and 5 shots on a 150 health player. Now this gun will actually be rewarding when used...


- Accuracy. Why in the world do we have a scope, but this thing ends up not being precise on the first shot? We can change the first shot to pinpoint before having some bloom recoil that is about the same as a crouched dab shot. If the weapon is meant to be used in a similar fashion to a sniper rifle, why isn't it capable of being as accurate?


- Fire Rate increase to make the weapon a little more of a threat. Maybe try increasing the value by .5 - 1 in Fire Rate and see if it's a little better. Doesn't have to have the same fire rate as a Full-Auto, but it shouldn't take forever to fire the whole magazine when the player can simply build a fort in about 2-3 seconds.


Thanks for taking the time to look into this weapon. It'd be great to actually feel like the Scoped AR is a weapon of precision rather than a gun that has a worse risk-reward ratio than the Revolver.



P.S. I'd like to throw in a side suggestion of expanding on the ammo piles for Small Bullets in Duos/Squads. Increase the ammo by 1.4x in Duos and 1.8x in Squads so we get 17 bullets per pile in Duos and 22 in Squads. Now, it won't take like 3 piles of Small Bullets just to get 1 more clip for an SMG since that was the main problem that Assault Rifles had before that patch.",FortNiteBR

Just going by the current build controls in combat pro, a few changes would let us always pick the exact build piece we want.

One potential version:

 * LB, RB, LT, X, and Right click could all be set to each build piece (including traps)

 * Left and Right d-pad could be used for rotate piece and change build mat, as they are currently unused. Down d-pad could also be used for something if needed as you don't need to emote while build is out.
 * B and RT could be kept as toggle build and place piece as the currently are

[My very first double pump game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlCif7-c9og&amp;list=PLWmAddd53zpmOHMUG---lkn5cfCSxG7bj)

Hey guys there was a clip earlier today about double pumps and I saw many differing opinions about its current existence in the game... So I decided to try it out for the the first time and see how difficult it is to pull off and gauge its potential, below you will find highlights of my first feeble attempts and my thoughts on the strategy.

My opinion is that this is completely busted in certain scenarios and particularly in solo's. I think when used correctly the fire rate can match if not exceed a tactical shotgun with the added benefits of having 10 shells to fire before reloading. Obviously other added benefits are a smaller spread and much higher damage. The one down side is the second occupied slot.

This is literally the first game I have ever done this so I know it was not executed flawlessly and while I admit I struggled a bit at first to coordinate my other mechanics with tapping 3/4 over and over again to switch weapons I feel this can be mastered within half a days playing or even a few matches.

What are your thoughts? Can we get an Epic comment on the future of this mechanic?",FortNiteBR

Don't let the gap stop you from sniping, building, or launch padding to the other island before they connect, or just build a massive fort and force them to play offense once the islands collide.

When it was purchased on the information screen I was told:

***""Play to level up your Battle Pass, unlocking up to 65+ rewards worth 12,000 V-bucks (typically takes 75 to 150 hours of play)""***

It's now become apparent to me and others that this simply is not true. One Redditor did the math and deduced that you would not be able to complete it if you purchase it after January 11, even though there would be another month left in the season. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7k26sa/the_hard_numbers_behind_the_battle_pass_and_why/

Levelling up the Battle Pass is incredibly grindy and actually encourages you to play the game less if your sole purpose is to unock everything. Just complete the trivial 'Daily Challenges' which can be accomplished in less than an hour if you're quick. Play any more than that a day and you're effectively wasting your time.

I'm not trying to attack Epic saying that they're liars and the Battle Pass is a horrific idea - I think it's a brilliant idea but the levelling up system really needs a massive overhaul.

My proposition (that I imagine would not be difficult to implement, or at least have tracked and the rewards be distributed to the qualifying) is that the Battle Pass actually have challenges that are accomplished in 75-150 hours of gameplay in a season.

For example:

* Play 100 solo matches

* Get 300 Assault Rifle Eliminations

* Get 10 Sniper Headshots

Or they could have milestones in-between where you unlock larger increments

* Win 100 matches (with milestones at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75)

With that being said, are we starting to see some kinks in their armor?  Let me explain...

I'm starting to get trained to be underwhelmed by the items Epic releases each week.

The non silenced SMG's are still inferior to shotguns in almost all scenarios.

The bush is still the most left behind item in the game. 

The blue scoped AR is still trash which is especially puzzling considering a number bump is all that's needed to balance it.

The smoke grenades are almost completely useless.

The campfire is ""fine"", which is faint praise.

Heck, the purple and gold silenced pistols are some of the better additions to the game and that's not saying much.

My question to you is this.  Do you think Epic is showing a weakness right now?  They don't seem to be able to add items that are useful AND fun to use.  Shouldn't useful and fun be the bare minimum?

I'm hoping Epic takes a break from releasing anything new and focuses on fixing some of these items for a few weeks.

The addition of new items is helping a lot and we look forward to what the new city and revised points of interest will bring. But it also made me think of a cool map idea: a tropical island.

Whether we like it or not, FBR is constantly compared to PUBG. That game just got a second map with a desert theme and I'd like FBR, if and when it expands its map pool, to go a different direction. I think a tropical island would help drive home the fact it's a unique game with its own identity.

I envision a map with usable space akin to what we have now, but spread across different land masses. A main central island (with a volcano, of course) covered in tropical forests and dotted with towns, villages, and resorts. Maybe some huge hotels, lots of pools, and tiny villas and tiki huts dotting the landscape. Bars and lifeguard huts out on the beaches... The main town could have a dock with an explorable cruise ship. There could be small islands just off the coast with shipwrecks around them for looting and cave systems... The possibilities are endless.

What I also think this would do is really embrace the colors and goofier nature of the visual design. Costumes could give us tourists and islanders and explorers and pirates and lifeguards... It could really help sell the game and its lighter sense of self, its wackiness and humor.

I'm not good enough to draw what I'm thinking, so maybe someone here can do that. But what do people think? What are some other good map themes people would like to see? Thanks for reading.",FortNiteBR

Let's discuss","With fine-tuning being brought to the boogie bomb to make sure it's strong, but not too strong, what do you think could be done to the smoke grenade to make it worth holding on to?

Few thoughts: 

* Give yourself and allies a movement speed boost while inside the smoke and for a split second afterwards
* Buffs allied building speed (building HP/s)

* Debuff enemy movement speed inside the smoke/disable sprint/jump
* Disable enemy reload/building inside the smoke 
* Enemy takes small damage per second inside the smoke (not really a fan, but here for sake of discussion)
* Purple smoke grenade pickup - automatically combusts after 5 seconds, lighting all players and structures on fire, light burn damage, heavy impact damage on wooden structures.

In the mean time, this item is good for throwing sideways as a distraction while you push enemy players from another angle. Pretty fun, just not consistently useful. 

Right now it's situationally *OK*, but I'd love to see it be worthwhile to keep throughout the game for some interesting tactical play. Cheers

Here is the update: ""The Boogie Bomb dance effect is now removed upon taking any damage. We will continue to monitor and iterate on this item’s functionality.""

(https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v-2-1-0-patch-notes)

I appreciate originally 10 seconds was to long, so changing it down to 5 seconds seemed reasonable upon the last update.

However, now if they're going to stop dancing after just one hit, then what is the point? You're just wasting a slot in your inventory. The bonus to it, was that you could land a couple of shots or that you could stop 2 or 3 guys and land a few shots on each. 

The boogie bomb itself is a weapon you can use in all sorts of ways, sneaking up on someone and dropping it then taking them out or storming a base when you're 1 v 2, going guns blazing and dropping it.
Now if you drop it and land a shot on someone, they're just going to immediately have the chance to fire back on you or build up a defense, while only taking a single shot worth of damage. Unless that shot they take is a shotgun to the head, chances are it's going to be anywhere up to around 50 points worth of damage. There is absolutely no point to this if you're only going to land a body shot and get 20 damage points. 

I'd rather save the slot for another item, and instead of using the bomb, just sneak up on someone and land a guaranteed shot straight away if they're going to get the chance to instantly fight back regardless. 

They should have kept it how it was and just made it more rare. Making it a gold (legendary) drop might have been a bit far, but a purple (epic) drop would have been reasonable to keep it how it was. It added an element of a new fun tactic into the game and it's just a shame to not have that now.

I just saw a lot of complaining recently about how broken the double pump setup is, and how hard it is for Epic to address this issue so I thought I would share my own suggestions and start a **discussion** on this.

**My suggestion** would be **adding global cooldown to weapons**, meaning that if you fired a type of weapon, it would put all of the same weapons in your inventory to cooldown. 

This would **only affect the pump shotgun and the bolt-action sniper**, as there is no other possible other situation where you could swap faster than the fire rate of a weapon.

One possible alternative is, if you want to influence only the pump is to add the global CD only for it, however I don't see why would anyone want to run double bolt :D

Feel free to share your thoughts on my suggestion or *your own idea* on how to fix this issue.",FortNiteBR

Most of us were hoping for a permanent duration or, at the very least, 60+ seconds.

Here is the main problem with the shorter duration...

It can't be used as bait on nearly the same scale as a longer duration campfire.

When players set the campfire, players are going to know the following...

One:  If no one is there, arriving players know someone is at least 25 seconds nearbye.  They either just took off, or they're hiding in bushes which will be far less likely.

Two:  The vast majority of players will utilize the heal.  By the time the team is done healing, the campfire will be mostly used up.  No one is going to stumble upon a campfire and utilize much healing from it.

If the campfire last 60 seconds, 90 seconds, or was permanent, we would get far more interesting interactions with it. 

1.  It would become excellent bait because you wouldn't be pressured to catch someone quickly. 

2.  It would be interesting to approach an existing campfire because you wouldn't know if it was bait, or if the enemy team simply healed up and left.  Plus, getting healed from someone elses campfire would just feel cool.

If Epic is worried about it becoming too OP, they could just nerf its heal rate to 3hp every 2 seconds.

Epic, I hope you were just in a hurry to get this in the game because it's clearly an item that could be so much more.",FortNiteBR

But there’s some things that don’t make sense.,"Like for instance: why is the tactical shotgun so mother🅱️ucking inconsistent?! It drives me absolutely crazy, to the point where I don’t even want to pick them up anymore because I’m more confident with an AR at the same distance anyways..

Another thing: are you suppose to be able to hear people sprinting on the ground? I can hear people sprint when they’re on a floor in a house or something, but not when they’re running on dirt. Do I just need to turn my headset up? I guess you can’t adjust footstep volume, right?

 People always manage to sneak up on me and I don’t even get a chance to react before I’m dead because I never hear anything. When they’re sprinting around my fort or whatever I can literally never hear their footsteps. I usually lose about 60% of my games because of this, someone sneaks up to my fort and kills me like it’s nothing.

Those are my two biggest issues with the game. Other than that I do really well in gunfights since I’m mostly a FPS player.

Which brings up another issue, as a FPS guy I’m great at fighting but my building is weaaaak. I’ve watched a few streamers and payed attention to how they build and I’ve gotten way better but I’m still not good, so anyone want to tell me how to build good?",FortNiteBR

I have been playing since late September and I absolutely love this game and the community that continues to follow it through. So to give back I am holding a contest with a reward of $25 USD in V-Bucks.

The contest is to guess the name of the upcoming city coming to Fortnite sometime later in the year. The city was mentioned in this [State of Development V3](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-v3) post and it has no official release date. A few simple rules to follow are stated below.

* You can post one comment with what you think is the name of this future city. Any other comments you make won't be counted as a guess.

* You are not allowed to edit your comment that includes your guess. Even if it is spelled incorrectly. Be sure to make spell checks before submitting :)

* If your comment containing your guess is edited it won't count.

The winner will be notified via private message here on Reddit after the city name has been announced. If one or more people guessed the same and correct name then we can communicate how each person wants to go about the reward in private messages. If no one guesses the correct city name then I will use a random name generator to randomly select one commenter from this post to win.

The contest will be closed for new submissions by a moderator after exactly **4 days** of this post by locking it so make sure to think of a name and get it in before then.

Again I want to say that I have seen this community grow, and grow, and grow into what it is now and I have to say that this community is one of the best to be a part of. Thanks everyone!

Between the lag, blatant hackers, low framerate, and difficult to aim guns, I found it impossible to beat people.  However, soon I ended up making it to the top fifteen almost every game through stealth and camping in sheds. 

A few days ago I finally got around to trying out fortnite, and within an hour I decided I'd never play PubG again.  Here's a list of what fortnite does better and worse than PubG

Better:

-Balance: The vast majority of kills in Pubg are with the generic assault rifles, nobody uses pistols, smgs, or shotguns past the first few minutes, and bolt action snipers are super rare.  In Fortnite, I kill people and get killed by all types of weapons

-Gunplay: Fortnite's gunplay is easy to learn, and difficult to master.  Anyone can get kills with a tactical shotgun, but there are always crazy new ways use the building system to win gunfights.  In Pubg, all the guns had an extremely annoying recoil pattern and it is extremely difficult to kill a player with full armor and health.

-Storm/Forcefield/Play Area: Pubg has a massive map, but the shrinking circle means you always have to be on the move to get to the play area.  In Fortnite, the storm isn't usually a direct threat, but it makes the map smaller when it needs to be

-Lag: Fortnite with the resolution on ""epic"" still runs better than Pubg at minimum graphics.  No shit.


Worse:
 
-Vehicles: The fast paced vehicle action of Pubg was one of the only things I miss

-Graphics: It's a personal thing, but I just can't stand the cartoony graphics

-Annoying sound glitch: About 33% of the time when I launch Fortnite there is either no sound at all or sometimes an extremely grainy sound.  If anyone can help please let me know how to fix this",FortNiteBR

I listed a few of my favorite loot routes and my strats behind them to give an idea of my though process and help you find new ones for yourself

This guide is targeted more for early game, If this gets enough positive feedback I would be happy to write up a separate guide on how I approach mid to late game and some strats regarding scavenging vs avoiding fights, best circle positions depending on your playstyle, and some tips for 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 engagements and anything in between! 

**General Dropping Tips**

- Learn a specific house or area to familiarize yourself with how to get loot quick
- I find prioritizing areas with close multiple random floor spawns increases chances of early game kills and surviving instead of prioritizing chests (Especially since they arn't guaranteed to spawn).
- To expand on the above point lots of people prioritize attic chests for example in salty but I can loot almost a whole building worth of floor drops before they can grab a chest and break into the next floor. Plus shotguns early are 100% Key and you don't find those in chests. 
- Pick the same spot and practice landing there as quick as possible over and over until you are very consistent at getting the landing close to perfect. My favorite place currently is Grimmz location (Back door of big blue house on the hill in salty). I'll expand on this below
- When looting an area always try and stay on the edge and move around on the edge constantly scanning the middle. Often times I have pinched players that get caught in the middle of a high traffic area.
- Grab wood early! Break beds/Cabinets/Trees , so many people don't get resources right off the bat and building two walls and some stairs can give you such an amazing advantage in early fights. Peaking with shotguns will net you a ton of kills even against players with better general aiming due to position advantage
- Just to restate BUILD IS SO GOOD early vs opponents with no materials. Minimizing damage early can net you so many kills and 90% of people that fight you will end up being caught in the open while you can build some nice cover to give you a massive massive advantage. I can't state enough how important this is and how much your early game will improve by doing so
- Check visible loot locations when parachuting to prioritize landing. (Roof tops/Through windows etc)

**Looting Path/Strats that work for me**

**Salty Springs (Higher difficulty Route)**- Full Credit goes to Grimmz for this one. I aim for back door of the big blue house on the west side of town. I run through the first/second floor of the house picking up any weapons i can find looking for a shotgun. When you practice the drop you can get there first and often get free kills on late landers who come in with pick axes. I proceed to get wood from inside an upstairs bedroom and build to the roof to challenge anyone who went for chest attic. Once my house is clear I scout for players in the open to look for kills for a minute. Then proceed to either go clock or counter clockwise on the edge of the area to loot places no one dropped and look for people caught in center. Don't forget to smack a big tree or two a couple of times to get 50+ wood. Only downside to this run is you can only check 1-2 item spawns while chuting so it can be a bit rng in terms of stuff you will find

**Farm (Medium Difficulty Route)** - My Strat for either farm is to aim for mansions porch roof. I check both 2nd floor windows at the front and look for a shotgun. If I find one I land on the porch roof and break through the wall and grab it. If some one lands on the roof run straight to the attic. 9/10 times if you get a quick drop you will catch some one off guard while they are just opening the chest which nets you a free kill and often the house loot. If there is no shotgun on the second floor I go straight to the main front door. Check the 3 spawns there for a shotgun and if there isn't one check the back room spawn. I then rush to the attic to challenge anyone going for that chest spawn. You ended up a little later starting from the first so they may be able to fight back this time around but id say 4/5 times you still get shotgun advantage. Once house is clear and you looted make sure to break some beds and cabinets for wood since trees are hard to come by there and get ontop of the roof. Look for enemies and plan an attack. Either push with materials and build yourself an advantage spot or try and take them out long range. You will be the most looted person in farms early since the mansion has the most loot in a small area, so use that advantage quick before they can catch up in loot

**South Trucks-&gt;Moisty (Easy Difficulty Route)** - Full credit to Dakotas for this one (His invitational strat). There are two trucks with large stacks of crates on the south side of Fatal fields at the bottom of the map. 3 chests spawns are there and a little hill north with another truck that can also spawn a chest and a random item. Move west to loot the broken house for more items and another chest. Then proceed to moisty and loot east to west. Moisty alone has 7 potential chest spawns on top of 5 chest spawns from the trucks and broken house. 13 possible chests is insane and very rarely will you run across another team here. This is a great for Solos, duos and even solo squads and probably one of the best paths for getting wins (Just don't expect too many kills over the course of the game) Highly recommend this for players who want to get wins or even newer players that want to get insanely looted in peace.

**My Opinions on different loot areas**

**Greasy/Pleasant Park** 

- Great loot condensed into a small area
- Moderate-High Popularity depending on bus route
- Great for solo/duo/squad
- Lots of early action
- Areas are kind of secluded, so mid game you wont run into a lot of people
- Great for Place to farm wins as you just need to win the fights early in town then can coast until end game well looted.
- Higher skill level players generally drop here
- Generally a little running is needed to get to the circle
- Don't need to worry about people coming from behind you during mid game
- Medium Kill potential games here.

**Salty/Retail**

- Great Loot in a small area
- Super high popularity for people to drop
- Good for Solo/Duo/Squad
- Generally either get 5+ kills early and survive or die trying very quick
- Kinda of like School in PUBG
- Tons of popular loot areas close by, gives plenty of flexibility to where you want to go after.
- Mid game you will run into a lot of people who are also very looted. High Risk but High reward if you win the fights
- Not great for win farming because you will die a lot early (Unless you are a god). 
- Early game can be really RNG some times. Some times you get a shotgun, other times your opponent does first and you die.
- Requires really good parachute drops and knowledge of item span locations to do well at consistently 
- Higher skill level players generally drop here
- Once of the few locations where 15-20 kill games are achievable
- Center of the map so not much running needed to stay in the circle
- Mid game players/teams can come from multiple different directions so can get Pinched easily if not careful

**Anarchy/Fatal**

- Great loot but spread out 
- Medium Popularity most times
- Good for Solo, Duo, Squad
- Very open area, so good building skills can give you a huge advantage vs other players due to lack of cover present
- Edge of the map so don't have to worry about players sneaking up behind you.
- Medium action mid game if you head towards center of the map or you can play safe and stay on edge of circle
- The skill range of players that generally drop here vary but id say on average it would be a Medium
- Really good place to go for wins since its on the edge and good loot
- Medium kill potential games depending on where you go after leaving the farm. 

**Loot Lake/Depots/Factories/Tomato Town/Prison**

- Low/Medium loot 
- Good for Solo/Duo but probably not enough to gear a squad decently 
- Popularity can vary depending on mode and bus route. But its generally lower but since its a small area it can feel busy often with only a few other players there
- Player Skill range varies again but I would say its a Medium
- Can be fun for early fights but often times can be under geared leaving this place unless solos
- Close to large map points so decent chance you will run into players with much stronger loot
- Not a great drop place for wins, but they can be great places to learn how to fight and build early without being overwhelmed by too many great players.
- Generally Medium kill potential games 

**Moisty/Flush Factory/Shipping crates**

- Above average loot 
- Low popularity so very few early fights generally 
- Good for Solo/Duo (Can go with a squad but generally you will leave a little poor)
- Can be difficult to traverse. Moisty requires building paths over the water to loot quick, Flush loot is a bit all over the place and requires some knowledge of spawns and Crates... Well crates you can't build anywhere so it can be a big pain
- Excluding Crates, Mid game is generally pretty quiet but you have to run a lot since you are on the very corners of the map 
- From most to least action mid game it would be (Crates&gt;Moisty&gt;Flush)
- Lots of secluded houses and huts to loot on route to circle with little chance to run into other players
- Low kill potential games
- Decent for getting wins. You will survive long but its an uphill battle at the end because you will be below average in terms of how looted you are most times
- Average skill level here is generally much lower then the other named locations. Lots of new players drop here to avoid lots of action and survive for a long time 

**Wailing/Lonely/RV Park/Race Track**

- Low Loot but condensed
- Good for solos, Okay for duos but you will probably be poor. Squads you are going to be hurting for loot when you leave
- Can often stay on the quiet side of the circle and avoid action a lot of the game.
- Have a chance of winning, you will live long but probably loose fights against more geared opponents
- Low kill potential games generally

 **Random houses/Shacks and other hidden places**

- Low loot
- Super low population, often there by yourself
- Can be viable for Solos but depends on your loot luck
- Great for surviving long in games
- Not a great strat to win games though as you will be poorer then the average person
- Low potential kill games
- Depending on which one you choose you may have to run a lot during the game
- Low skill average for players, Generally new players trying to avoid early fights and get some gear without dying instantly.

If you made it this far thanks for reading! I ended up typing 10 times as much stuff as planned but I was always good at ranting a ton about video games I love!

**PS. To the Mods**, Not sure if this breaches the promotion subreddit rule section, so please let me know if I need to remove the below. 

**Little back ground about myself**
I have been playing for quite some time now, moved from console to PC recently. My first 100 games I was having a hard time keeping my head above 1.0kd, but after watching tons of high skill streamers and tons of videos I have to improve myself a bunch and happy to share what i have learned that has helped me a ton.

I just started streaming 2 days ago and loving it. I have helped quite a few players get better in the past and I'm always happy to help players wanting to learn and improve their game play through questions in chat as well as willing to play Duos where I can watch you play and give some tips on how to improve your success in Fortnite! Come find me on Twitch or add me in game (Handle: **OverdueYeti**) and I'd be more then happy to lend my help!!! 

Hope this can help!

**Cheers Ladies, Gents, and Human beings!** (Playing it safe, don't want to offend any of those Apache Helicopters :P)

First and foremost I want to say that I really love Fortnite and that I play it everyday since mid Dec. I came from PUBG (Obviously) and here is my take on the ""casual"" vibe of Fortnite.



**Intricacies that I really like:**



Well I think a lot of people agree with me that the building aspect of FNBR is the unique take on the BR genre. When I started playing this game I used the F-keys to build and didnt bind them to any specific buttons. I thought: Nahh I dont need them I just shoot and win. Later I started watching streams and got to see some incredible stuff you can do with the building mechanic and so I was starting to implement techniques to my style.

**Whats so good about the building that many new players or ""outisiders"" miss out on?**



&gt; If you get caught open field you can build your own cover and dont die imediately


&gt; If the enemy builds a fort you can rush them from up top, even level oder juke him with two different stairs to hide your entry point


&gt; Buildings are destroyable and farming materials add another layer of depth


&gt; Getting faster at building actually gives you an edge against similarily skilled gun players


&gt; Spamming walls is acutally (in contrast to many believes) not a ""viable"" technique eventually you get caught by shots and get rushed



Recently I noticed that many people tend to say that Fortnite is casual and that I think thats not true. I guess the shooting can be random sometimes but I think its actually good and if they rework it I think it will be awesome. I see PUBG players trashing on Fortnite the most so I figured I start a discussion to share some thoughts on this matter.



TL;DR What is your take on FNBR being ""casual""?

On top of other things, being able to take a direct headshot from a sniper rifle and survive is absolute nonsense. You can regularly do this because of how many potions drop.

 Please fix this, it really makes it not fun to play. I'm so frustrated by this, its made all my friends hate/quit. Several streamers I've been watching say the same thing.

How do we fix it?,"I KNOW this has been a topic since forever but I feel like we have to show EPIC how good the building on console could be if we help them by giving them the best ideas we can come up with.


All following button examples are for ps4.

So we know of the delay that comes with building and switching weapons.. I'm pretty sure this will get fixed soon. We know of falling through your own stuff. Which I'm also sure will be fixed soon. 

NOW.. How I think building needs to work to be as good as on pc.

1) Give us a sensitivity setting for building.

2) Remove auto aim when editing pieces.

3) When in build mode:

- Remove switching through walls, stairs, floor and roof
- Use L1 to select wall. Use L1 to confirm wall. same to R1, R2, L2. When confirming for example stairs, stairs will still be selected. 

So in order to make a 1x1 tower you press -&gt;

O   (open build mode)

L1 (select wall) 

L1 (confirm wall)

L1 (confirm wall)

L1 (confirm wall)

L1 (confirm wall)

R1 (select stairs)

R1 (confirm stairs)

This will not save any time on a 1x1x1 mini fort but it will save time on anything going higher or more complicated than that. Why? Well you save 1 button press on every switch from wall to stairs. 

Having those 4 shoulder buttons let's us switch to what we want way faster and more consistent.

One last example.
People like to push by using double stairs.
On Console for the first set of stairs to appear you need to press                   -&gt; O_R1_R1_R2                 With this idea you press -&gt; O_L1_L1

Now if you are done with your double stairs and are in a good spot you (maybe) want to put two walls infront of the last set of double stairs. 
On console you would have to press -&gt; L1_L1_R2_R2 (switch_switch_place_place) with this idea that would go -&gt; R1_R1_R1 (switch_place_place)


Basically this improves consistency and overall building experience.


I really hope EPIC will fix building on console because building is 50%of your Fortnite experience.

Sorry for grammar and greetings from Germany :)

I’m using 8 8 .60 .60 and these are great settings for building and all the other guns but shotguns I just can’t seem to get better at. I’m not sure if it’s a limitation of a controller or just not enough practice but after so many matches I feel like I should be pretty good with a shotgun but I’m not. Some days I’ll play like a god and murder a whole squad with a green pump but others I’ll get 4 shots off before my opponent can get one and I’ll miss them all. My main problem is that I’m not consistent so I’m wondering if I should be using a lower sensitivity for winning shotgun battles. I’ve seen some of the pros and they all have them all over. Some have all Max sens and some have them as low as 4. What do you guys tend to use? ,FortNiteBR

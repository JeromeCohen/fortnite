\-Arena points are reset and players have to play 20 matches at which point they get their 'rank' based on percentage of players

\- Epic should wait until a certain number of players have played their 20 matches and players that are waiting for the ranks to be decided play games with players with similar points

\-Epic should rank players based on percentage and make it a dumbbell effect

\-If they stuck with the 7 divisions they should make each division a 100-200 point wide bracket and players should start at a certain point number in a division down to percentiles

\-Grand champion is for players who go over division 7 points

\-Bus pass fare is lower for lower ranks and higher for higher ranks to maintain the dumbbell effect

\-Rank decay should happen every 2 weeks and you lose a certain amount of points and drop down rank

\-Making top rank where you can play in tournaments really hard to get into and stay in should be a big concern so arena is a good place to get practice

**Points and bus fare:**

\-Bus fare for solos should be Division 1: -1, 2: -2, 3: -3, 4: -3, 5: -4, 6: - 5, 7: -5, Grand Champion: -6

\-Points for solos should be Top 25: 2, Top 20: 2, Top 15: 2, Top 10: 2, Top 7: 1, Top 5: 2, Top 4: 1, Top 3: 1, Top 2: 1, Victory Royale: 4, Elims = 1 Point

\-Bus fare for duos should be Division 1: -1, 2: -2, 3: -3, 2: -3, 5: -4, 6: - 5, 7: -6, Grand Champion: -7

\-Points for duos should be Top 15: 2, Top 12: 2, Top 10: 2, Top 7: 2, Top 6: 2, Top 5: 2, Top 4: 1, Top 3: 2, Top 2: 2, Victory Royale: 4, Elims = 1 point

\-This means that division 5 is the first one with a net loss of points but only slightly (20ish points) and the net loss increases making it harder at higher ranks

\-Epic should adjust bus fares to maintain the dumbbell effect

**Map:**

\-I think it would be interesting to play on different maps, so perhaps when on the starting island everyone votes for a map and that one is played, obviously it would be hard to choose a map before going into game and keep queue times short

\- Map choice should be done in terms of competitive balance (season 1 has a lot less loot spots and mobility than later seasons so I believe it should be ruled out)

\-The maps I believe would be most balance are 3.0, 4.5, 5.1, 6.3, 7.4, 8.0, season 8 map with updated loot lake and 9.0 (minus the slipstreams and neo tilted and mega mall has good mats) Use this to see what those maps looked like:  [https://fortniteskins.net/maps/](https://fortniteskins.net/maps/) 

\- They could also make new maps with mixes of old and new locations 

\- Add a new map every season but it should be competitively balanced

\- There should be no RNG for map mobility (rifts and geysers) or vehicle spawns (100% spawn rate)

\-Things to do with the story line (anti gravity areas, kevin, leaky lake) should not be implemented with old maps but I think they should maybe keep shadow stones etc for mobility and maybe add more mobility spawns

\-In online custom tournaments (summer skirmish, winter royale) and LANs maps are voted for but once they have been played a certain number of times (2 for 8 games) they can't be voted for again

**Weapons and items:**

\-For perfect balance there should only be one variant for each weapon and when deciding what weapon will come out of chest or spawn on the floor, it is a equal chance of weapon type (Silenced bolt 50%, heavy sniper 50%)

\-AR's: Blue M4, purple scar, purple infantry, blue scoped AR and old blue ak. They should buff the blue M4's fire rate so it and the scar have the same DPS making it choice of higher damage per shot or faster fire rate. The scoped ar should be given a faster fire rate (4) and more damage (30), it should also be given a 2.5x multiplier for headshot

\-SMG's: Silenced SMG and P90, revert P90 mag back to 50 as silenced has higher dps and give it same bloom as silenced#

\-Pistols: Remove all pistols except deagle

\-Snipers: Heavy and silenced bolt. Heavy does 250 player built structure damage but it's original damage to environment structures. Heavy does 120 body, bolt does 110. Louder heavy pull out sound so you can prepare for a wall replace

\-Explosives and utility: Stinks, grenades, dynamite, gliders, rift, RPG, grenade launcher. Remove boogie bombs (easy to use and OP), Stinks max carry should be 4 (they drop in 2) and they should implement the blooming of the stink when it is first thrown (Suggested by vivid), grenades have a glowing effect and max stack is 6, dynamite max stack is 6, gliders should have 5 charges and a glide 75% as fast as a launch pad. When coming out of shadow bomb there should be a delay before you can shoot and players about to come out of shadow mode should be more visible. Rocket cap should be 6 unloaded, RPG should do 80 damage to players and grenade launchers should do 85 (IMO rockets deserve a place in the game as anti-turtling but they do too much damage and people would be more careful with how they use their rockets with a lower cap. Keep rifts as they are (maybe lower the height of the rift opening)

\-Vehicles: Hoverboard and quad are the only vehicles and they should have increased spawn rates around the edge of the map. This obviously means vaulting ballers

\-Shotguns: Pump, heavy and combat shotgun. Pump does 95 damage with a 200+ headshot. Heavy shoots 5 pellets and does 85 damage but still does 200+ headshot. Combat shotgun does 65 damage and still does a 200+ head shot and has it's fire rate reduced to 1.5. All shotguns should do 200+ headshot as if only one is can do 200 headshot then that shotgun will be the most used/overpowered. Pump is the easiest to hit shots with (largest reticle) but still rewards good aim and has good burst damage, combat rewards players that hit all of their shots (low damage but high fire rate and tight reticle), and heavy is the in betweener with good range (5 pellets, medium sized reticle)

\-Traps: Spike trap does 125 damage, new trap like campfire for shield, launch pad and campfire stay the same. When there is a trap spawn each trap has a 25% chance of spawning, number of launch pads should be capped at 3-4 

\-Healing: Only adjustment to healing I would like to see is chug jugs providing 10 health/ shield per second it is used and when it is completed it maxes out your hp and shield. If it isn't fully consumed, let's say you drink for 10 seconds and gain 100 hp, it ticks down 2 hp per second until you are back at your health before it was consumed meaning it is better to fully use it but it is still useful late game

\-Chests: Chests have a 33.3% chance of dropping a utility item but they always drop healing

\-Chest and floor loot spawn 100% of the time

**Tournaments:**

\-Only certain ranks can access tournaments, qualifying for tournaments should be like normal except after top 3000, the top 100 play customs and the qualifying players are decided from that

\-There should be cosmetic rewards for reaching a certain rank or achieving a certain placement in a tournament to give people an incentive

This would maintain high skill on controller while also taking away l2 spam. Jump shot are current one of the hardest shots to hit on controller because of the poor aim acceleration and lack of aim assist so good controller players avoid those shots a lot.

Disabling vehicles was an awful decision because it does nothing to fix the bug that quad users have and only makes users of hoverboards and ballers face the consequences of the bug as well. By disabling the vehicles, you are completely changing the way a large amount of players play literally hours before the event. Not to mention the fact that most quad users probably knew about the bug and had already adapted by switching over to either the hoverboard or baller, instead of completely changing their landing spots and rotations. Very poor decision making on Epic Games's side, they should be trying to level the playing field by cushioning the blow to quad users, not collectively ruining everyone's experience.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic has displayed ZERO competitive integrity and it's disgusting,"As someone that does play FN I always understood why the pros complain about things. I know some people think that it's annoying and whatnot, but if you really look at how Epic has treated their pro scene, how can you not sympathize with the pro's? 

There are just so so many examples of a lack of competitive integrity when it comes to Fortnite.

The Winter Royale is 100% the biggest example that pops into my head when I think of Epic just being braid dead. Right before a huge online tournament, Epic releases season 7, along with Planes and the Infinity Blade.

These changes were meta defining and changed the ENTIRE climate of the tournament. 

Now we're in season 9 and nothing has changed apparently.

Epic disables all vehicles for the qualifiers for their biggest tournament so far with the biggest prize pool that anyone has ever seen. 

Quads and Hoverboards being disabled is bad because of how people use them for rotating and mobility. Ballers being disabled is unfathomable due to the fact that they can define how people play the game. Players design their strats and game plans around ball spawns. As much as everyone does hate ballers in competitive, they shouldn't have been disabled in this ridiculous way, and I think everyone can agree with that. It's just plain unfair.

What's also crazy to think about is that the people over at Epic KNOW that Ballers are insanely game changing. They know how big of a role they play in these tournaments 

From a 100% spectator standpoint, it'll be good to watch the qualifiers without ballers, but I feel for the pro's and everyone playing today. 

I hope one day Epic can get their shit together. I really really do. I want this game to have a solid competitive scene, but right now it doesn't look like that will happen anytime soon

Good luck to anyone playing today, and wishing even more luck to anyone that had their strat centered around ballers.",FortniteCompetitive

This ping issue has frustrated me to the extent I do not ever want to play arena and grind for champions league although I am capable. I am not the best player, but I have spent so much time into this game and cannot even play competitively. I know another guy in my school and he is placing quite high in the wc. Epic also thinks that arena is an ""alternative"" to applying siphon in a 24/7 way, but we cannot even compete properly. Others and I would love to play arena more as it is a great way to learn and grow as a player but I can't.

My unlocked FPS is 140 - 180 at max. If I unlock the FPS in the game, textures are NOT loading, and I can't do anything about that. Reinstalled the game, tried this, tried that, nothing - nothing.

When I lock my FPS to 60, textures will sometimes not load, but mostly it works fine - until the FPS drops come, from LOCKED FPS it goes from 60 to 25 in the endgame (WC Qualifiers, etc.) or even classic solos.

When I turn the stream on, it may work nice for couple of games, but then suddenly nothing will load and I'm fighting people at 25 fps for crying out loud.


I wouldn't be ranting if the FPS was like this from the start - everything is on LOW, back in season 3 everything was on HIGH and the game didn't drop below 70 FPS, not even 45 in most high loaded cases (stream etc.)

Now? I can't stream, play, enjoy and be competitive like other people are? Does it mean I need to buy i7 or 2080 Nvidia graphics card? I know my PC is good enough to run this game at good settings because I run other more "" harder "" games for performance without issues. How come the performance keeps dropping in this weird (would call it shitty but don't want to be rude I like this game) game?

Not a single patch people adress PC performance issues, just on Switch, I just can't believe Epic ignores this because I KNOW I am not the only one who has massive performance issues on this game.

Hopefully something will be done in the future. Going from 150 FPS to 12 in a matter of seconds in a fight is something you just cannot control, and it is not the hardware issue.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

With all the money Epic has made from Fortnite, one would think that they would have a development team that knows how to write code. It is not as if vehicles are a new thing. How the fuck do you end up coding a bug into models that have been used and tested so many times?

They changed the entire mechanics of fighting by removing the pump, every fight revolved around the timing and big possible damage now replaced with an unknown meta. 

They added more baller spawns and buffed tacs (literally opposite of what competitive players wanted)

They changed two major POIs of the map (which isn’t too horrible since it’s just progression of the new season, nothing they can do about that) 

They added the slipstream which can ruin Endgame and gives transportation anywhere

All within 2 days of World Cup quals

Now, literally in between quals and finals there is no more vehicles, a core factor of the game and where people drop. This changes tons of things, now if you get contested at lets say junk vs the nearby warehouse you have no chance to get to a far zone in time without that quad or hover. In the desert all you have is a few rifts quickly taken at paradise, and the flying station which is difficult to reach in time and doesn’t go extremely far. Overall, this is just too much change to truly be competitive game or tournament.

Most of my fights are nowhere near the build fights they use to be as whoever is on low usually just sprays away. I find the only time I make edit plays now is more to escape someone spamming or surprise an enemy, I think we’d all agree that edits just don’t feel as powerful or useful as they once were. As for aim, I’ve logged way too many hours on this game and use a contrlller on PC so it’s not like I need pinpoint aim for my AR, smg/tommy or TAC whereas I was rewarded greatly for improving my pump aim. 

So idk, I don’t see the point anymore. Which sucks, bc i felt like all that warming up and even just practicing in creative truly led to results in game overtime and that’s a rewarding feeling. Gave me incentive to keep grinding but now, idk what to even practice. So curious, does anyone feel the same?

Epic has pushed me to point where I’m simply not going to play this game anymore. I have no hope. I have no motivation. I have no joy in playing. How could anyone possibly enjoy endless spraying, bugs, and 3rd, 4th, and 5th parties?

The money, time, and practice I’ve put into this game just to be betrayed week after week in these past few months makes me feel so ignored and pushed aside.

At first I was excited to play the WC qualifiers every week. Put my skill to practice against other skilled players and see whereabouts I place, what I can improve, and what I can continue to do. But it’s become literally impossible with these constant game-changing updates that occur weekly.

Epic used to listen to their community. But for some reason now (and in recent months), we’re being treated like we don’t know anything. As if Fortnite’s most dedicated and loyal player segment doesn’t know what’s good for the game.

I’m not going to dive in and talk about what’s wrong with the game. We all know. There’s tons of posts on here anybody can view to see how obviously broken this game is right now. But what’s the point of even trying? It’s a losing battle. Epic will n e v e r change their stubborn ways.

So that’s it for me. I’m not even going to bother with it anymore. This has been a lot of time wasted.

Thank you to everyone on this sub, especially those who shared great tips and metas to help improve everyone’s gameplay—you’ve helped me and likely thousands of other players.

I enjoy it, but mainly for the siphon feature, not the actual competition. As a casual player, I like where fortnite is right now (with of course a few exceptions). There is a lot of variety in how the game could be played (whether you want to just mess around or actually try and win), which I find refreshing. 

But personally, I don't see how this game can facilitate an extremely competitive environment that is purely based on the skill of the player compared to the skill of the player and randomness. With all of the changes that happen throughout the season to guns and locations, it doesn't provide for a stable competitive environment for people to really be able to show their real skill at the game itself. And I see people consistently complain about the issues that have risen in the competitive scene, and if I were serious enough to play this game that way, I would be upset as well.

My question to anyone here who either hates or loves the competitive fortnite scene, what is it that either made you hate it or love it. Or if there is any other information or opinions you want to give, go ahead. I'm just curious to see what everyone thinks.",FortniteCompetitive

The Tac allows players to make the upmost stupid decisions with no thought and still get at least one hit on you. The tac and combat shotgun are not instant kill, so even if you hit a perfect shot the other player can still take health off you because he has time to react. With the pump however if the other player makes a stupid decision like not building while another player try’s to take his wall, he get punished. Now with the new shotguns you can’t even make edit plays. Fortnite’s goal is to handicap good players every since this game has gotten a little competitive.",FortniteCompetitive

This was the first shooter I've ever played, I've spent 1.5 years learning and grinding. Dozens and dozens of 8+ hr days just building muscle memory. 

And recently I had felt I had unlocked something. I was starting to win multiple solos a day, as opposed to the months prior where I was only winning ever month or so. I was grinding my pump shotgun aim, and was starting to win fight after fight based only on the strength of that.

I don't think its an understatement to say that buildfighting with a pump shotgun is the most fun I've ever had in any video game ever. It is on the one hand unbelievably complex and multifaceted, yet, when mastered, a smooth feeling of being one with your character, completely immersive and satsifying.

And it's all gone in an update. Because of my work schedule, this is the only solo qualifier I've been able to play. After a year of practice, I was truly looking forwards to competing. And it's just gone, everything I worked for, replaced with endless spam. I really don't want to sound too dramatic, but I am truly disappointed and sad about this decision. 

I guess when I think back on playing fortnite, I'm going to remember the fun I had learning, the thrilling Arena wins, the massive buildfights, the outplays, the close calls, the friends I made in random duos. So it wasn't in vain. It wasn't all wasted time.",FortniteCompetitive

Play it on a loop while you adjust your headset EQ. Adjust until each frequency seems to be roughly the same volume.

Hi everyone,

In my experience, headsets come with built-in equalizer (EQ) presets aren't ideal for Fortnite. For example, my new headset audio was picking up way too much gunfire (it hurt my ears) and not enough footsteps.

If you’re having this same issue, try using these steps to customize your EQ to make the different in-game sounds more equal in volume.

While trying to figure out the best way to do this, I came across this reddit post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/a1opsw/eq\_settings\_on\_nari\_ultimate\_and\_thx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/a1opsw/eq_settings_on_nari_ultimate_and_thx/)  in which a commenter suggested using brown noise to set your EQ. After looking into it further, I came to my own conclusion that it would be best to use pink noise instead. You can read about the differences here:  [https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones\_pinknoise.php](https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_pinknoise.php); [https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones\_brownnoise.php](https://www.audiocheck.net/testtones_brownnoise.php).

1) Download the pink noise clip in the link. 2) Play it in a loop using a media player that has its EQ disabled (I used Windows Media Player). 3) While listening to the loop, adjust the EQ in your headset software until each frequency seems to be roughly the same volume.

This is the EQ I got when I did this for my headset. You can see that it's a long way from flat.

Be grateful that we have a game that stays fresh.  We've never had a game with so many updates in the history of gaming.  And about the shotgun... I am a casual player, and to be honest, I've never loved the game more than I do right now.  Its annoying hearing streamers say we want this, and we want that..  Epic needs to do this..   Epic is a business with over 250 million registered players.  How many of those are pro players?  50K?  100K?  Its a fraction of the total base.  If you ran a business would you change what you do to make less than 1 percent of your customers happy and turn the rest away?  Knock it off.  You are still the best.  You are still going to win.

&amp;#x200B;

Streamers - Imagine the game if there was ONLY pro players.  Would you like that?  I would hope not becasuse you would be nowhere near where you are now.  You need casual players to keep playing the game.  You should be on Epics side with any decision they make.  They make decisions to get more people in the lobby.  More people in the lobby means more people subbing to your stream.  Think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I know what you are all scared of.  I have around 1200 games played and I'm lucky to get a kill or two per game.  But since the new changes happened, I got my first win in solos.  Casual players have a chance now.

I decided to do some tests to find out how the turbobuild delay works. TL;DR and youtube vid at bottom

This is what the [v8.30](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v8-30) patch notes says about Turbo Build: ""Optimized the network traffic used by the building mechanic to request new structures. Turbo building will submit requests to build new structures every frame after the initial delay."" This says that there is a 50 ms delay after you pull out the building plans, and after that delay, your game will start to send the build request to the server. This means that on 0 ping, the earliest you can build is 50 ms after you pull out your blueprints, and on 50 ping (very reasonable ping), the earliest your build will place is at 100ms.

I have 0-5 ping in Creative, so I set up a few [macros](https://imgur.com/a/SjtFxJt) with set timings and I decided to test the delay out. I'll link a video at the end of this post if you are interested. My macro presses Left Shift (Floor Bind),and then press Left Mouse Button, and x ms later (50ms/100ms) it would press Q (Pyramid bind) and 50ms later, it would release Left Mouse Button. I experimented both switching to a pickaxe/gun before pressing the bind, and staying on my building plans before pressing the bind. If a floor piece did not place, it means that the delay was too short and my macro switched to Pyramid before the Floor request was sent to the server.

Results:


Macro Delay(ms)|Pickaxe/Gun Out|Building Plans Out|Floor Placed| Pyramid Placed
---|---|----|----|----
50| Yes| No| No| Yes
50| No| Yes| Yes| Yes
100| Yes| No| No| Yes
100| No| Yes| Yes| Yes

What does this mean? It means that the turbobuild delay only begins after you switch to building plans. If I am on my pickaxe, I have to switch to building plans and wait 50 ms before I can send a build request to the server. Then I have to wait for the server to validate and build it, and then the data has to come back to my game for it to show it on my screen. For someone on 50 ping (common with Wifi) this whole process can take 150ms. But if I was already on building plans, I can immediately send the build request to the server without waiting the initial 50ms (since I already passed the delay when I pulled out the plans). And this is the case. If I am on building plans (with 0 ping) I can successfully send and place a build with 1ms delay.

How does this make turbobuilding inconsistent?

50 ms is a lot of time in a reactionary game where every millisecond matters. If you've ever jumped off your build with a shotgun, tried to place a floor to catch yourself but switched off too early and missed the build, the initial 50ms turbobuild delay is to blame. I don't see why this delay is here, but I'm sure it's there for a reason. Epic, if you see this, could you communicate on if that delay can be shortened or removed? The closer building can get to client-side, the better (obviously it can't be completely client sided). 

**TL;DR:** Turbobuild delay (50ms) begins after you switch to building plans. After that delay, your game sends a request to server, and then it comes back to your game. If you were holding your pickaxe and tried to build a wall, the whole process would take 50ms(delay) + ping(to server) + ping(back to your game) for the first piece to place. If you were holding blueprints, it will skip the 50ms delay and will just take ping + ping (ms). Epic pls remove 50ms delay?

here is my thoughts on it...

People are calling Ninja a hypocrite saying he was talking trash but now all of a sudden he is Fortnites Golden Boy which isn't true, Ninjas main source of money and fame has come from fortnite. Once fortnite dies Ninja dies with it, ninja will not become irrelevant but viewers and fame will decline Ninjas point is that EPIC is going to kill its game either way right now which does seem the case. If content creators bash the game it's only going to die faster than it will be EPIC killing it on its own, the content creators are in the long run making the reason they got fame and spotlight go away faster than it has to. Makes a lot more sense from a business side !!

A few people requested that I made an encompassing guide of all the game impacting changes that have influenced competitive play. Ranging from Boomboxes (https://clips.twitch.tv/FaintBlatantFoxHumbleLife) being released on the morning of the first third party Fortnite LAN event to a Mythic bug-riddled(https://twitter.com/72hrs/status/1073018446898651136) Sword being released the day before the Winter Royale.

The early days of Fortnite Competitive revolved around pubstomping tournaments up until Epic announced an 8 million Prize for an 8 week series of Summer Skirmishes. (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/fortnite-summer-skirmish)

The first Week of Summer Skirmish Start of Season 5 featured a horrendous amount of Server Lag which led to the event being ended early (https://youtu.be/HcJh7X2GzyM?t=633) however there was a positive. Valuable feedback on server performance was released in a postmortem : (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/summer-skirmish-week-1-postmortem). An interesting excerpt from the postmortem ""We’re thinking carefully about how to address late-game building for long-term health of competitive play""

The second Week of the Summer Skirmish featured public game 10 Solo with a kill based incentive, two days of games were held one for EU and one for NA. An investigation was held into the winner of the tournament by Epic and they were found not to have cheated in any way after controversy. (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90q2bn/summer_skirmish_week_2_friday_winner/) This also led to a lot of Pro's saying they would use XIM4 (https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleSpeedyLaptopTTours) for upcoming tournaments as Console lobbies were easier as also found out by this reddit post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/941bh3/console_bots_vs_pc_bots_a_comparison_of_idropz/).

The third instalment of the Summer Skirmish featured a Race to the Crown format and more controversy. Chap and 72 hours had won two games and were in a prime position to take the Crown first and Win. They, however, failed to make queue and despite Twitch Chat as well as the Skirmish Discord calling for a restart nothing was done in time. To quote an article ""Annnd they lost. Saf and Zayt won, beating out Bizzle and Hesi who got enough kills to get over the 13 point threshold, but Saf and Zayt went on to win the actual game, which put them over the top in the end. Bizzle and Hesi did not seem to understand the (admittedly poorly explained) rules, thinking they were the instant winners after ticking over 13 mid-game (the rules do say ""first to 13""). But the points aren't actually tallied until after the game is over. And again, Liquid had one less game to rack up points than all the other top contenders."" (https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/07/27/another-fortnite-summer-skirmish-screw-up-taints-an-otherwise-improved-week-3/#7101e5072094)

Another major issue that was becoming prevalent during Week 3 was Stretched Resolutions looking bad on the main stream. Epic had been using , this isn't a joke, an Excel Spreadsheet with links to players streams to spectate. This led to a unique issue with how they chose to spectate leading up to other events.

Also an issue was the great caster of Courage was led in shambles with no information about the game which made it very confusing for viewers not knowing standings or if their favourite player was alive or dead.

Unfortunately idropz_bodies couldn't compete this week as he had to pick up his cousin from the airport. https://i.redd.it/y7h6mcxeisq11.png
Week 4 kicked of the first Private Solo tournament that had a Hold the Throne Point System. It was played on patch 5.10 which saw the return of the Guided Missile which went straight into the Comp loot pool. Here is Myth getting outplayed by the Missile https://youtu.be/pmm9bDpnPE8?t=737. Another issue with this solo week was the mechanic of the clingers instantly blowing up after a building piece they were connected to was broken. This as well a c4 spam would become increasingly prevalent strategies that were failed to be fixed before the next Duo week.

Week 5 trialed a very kill based format with 1 point per kill and a multipliers for either getting 7 elims or a Win. There was no incenetive for placement at all other than the next game bonus multiplier for winning. The infamous double barrell was added this week which at the time of release did 150 damage to a BODY SHOT. A player lucky enough to loot this new item would have an extreme advantage in close quarters engagements. C4 + Clingers were becoming much stronger as players got better at using them against players in builds. Here is Snood outplaying Vivid with C4 + Vivid Poggering Out (https://youtu.be/EARe4cQwZM8?t=797). Clinger Spam in general was absurd if you watch this video from this timestamp (https://youtu.be/aQW_paDgzWc?t=999)

Week 6 was a crossover between the Summer Skirmish and Twitch Rivals player where one Pro and one Content creator/ streamer was invited. Certain Duos such as Ninja/Cloak as well a Poach/SpaceLyon were much stronger pairings compared to other players like Vivid/ Disguised Toast (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/99g84j/i_came_2nd_at_the_fortnite_summer_skirmish_last/)

Week 7 continued Twitch Rivals with random Duos with Pro and Content Creator. There was still the discrepancy of better pro duos being unfairly matched such as Nate/ Funk compared to Sonitrust being paired with a Male pornstar who wasn't very good. Ultimately both these past two weeks were about finding bad duos to farm early/midgame kill points. C4 spam got to an all time high during these weeks

Also to note was the rift to go being added as well as the Soaring 50s mode being tested.

Pax West Pax West concluded the Summer Skirmish with a million and a half prize pool. Epic also decided to ditch the one Elimination for a point that had a strong incentive fighting in favour of a bracketed system where you have to kill 3 players just to earn a point.

The qualifying system was very good during this event however, top 32 from heats move to nightly qualifiers and top 33 from there go to Grand Finals. (https://i.imgur.com/n8sMDpe.png) Lots of chances to try to qualify and no one who didn't earn a spot was there. There was one exception to this where a coin flip determined one player making it to finals over another (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddonbo4sS8g).*sticky nickel*

There was an extreme problem with forced peripherals as well as forced video settings. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DpQC7r4X4AAOyP4.jpg:large) This was done mainly as Epic was using capture cards for individual PC's rather than any kind of spectator system. Competitors were not happy as PC performance would suffer as well as their own.

https://twitter.com/LiQuiD112/status/1050467470669099008
There was more concern regarding forced peripherals by the Sponsors and according to Zayt's tweet (https://twitter.com/zayt/status/1113531135894728704) the reason a g502 mouse was chosen instead of a variety of Logitech mice such as G Pros is that someone at Epic liked it.

There was also numerous bugs that occured to people duing Finals and potentially costed a large amount of Money. (https://youtu.be/yqRXJSz0xwU?t=1263) Here Nate Hill couldn't pickaxe a floor due to a dead persons hitbox as well.

During the first Heats technical problems caused a delay of more than an hour, and the opening match was forced to restart because of further issues. The decision was ultimately made to reduce the number of games from six to four.

Another major issue was how in game events, the low gravity fields from Kevin, caused a bug where players indefiently flew and couldn't land. (https://youtu.be/X8kpMOMx330?t=786) Players also died from a fall damage bug caused by this. Epic made a questionable decision to add an impromptu 7th game that shifted some players scoring where they would have won more from the event being over sooner as they didn't score points in the last game.

A further issue was players all wearing dark skins such as Elite Agent to hide in shadows due to other players being unable to see them because of Epic Video Settings.

This concludes the first part of my look back at competitive integrity throughout Fortnites History and why We, the fortnite community, should expect no more than to be treated poorly by developers and expect nothing less than poor communication.",FortniteCompetitive

Thank you and I appreciate you listening to my little ted x talk lmao. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe Epic truly knows what they're doing and here is why, so when you look at not only tourneys but every single playlist, a pump shotgun is pretty much a MUST have gun whatever your loadout and as much as Epic wants people to use a certain type of meta just like an AR is also a must have, there's plenty different of variarites of ar's that can be viable as well to use along with different diversity of other ar's in the game. With shotguns that isn't the case, there's the pump shotgun and the tactical shotgun. The tac was complete garbage and still is compared to what the pump used to hit for but it wasn't viable what so ever to use till the end of the game, the only source of shotgun you had to have was a pump. The pump shotgun used to hit for over 200+ damage if you hit your shots well and wouldn't give enemy players to defend themselves after 1 shot because they would get 1 shotted even at 200HP. The pump was simply the only viable shotgun and it was a must have in every single game and that isn't what Epic wants. They want different types of shotguns that work differently for all types of players with all types of playstyles, remember when some players used to prefer the tac over the pump because of their playstyle but than switched to the pump regardless if it suits their playstyle because it's just way better? So currently right we have 2 shotguns, We have a buffed tac which I haven't tested as much yet but we will see how it roles out in the upcoming weeks, and we have the combat shotgun which is has a pretty far distance but does little damage. Now for all the people that are not aware of this, we are also getting the heavy shotgun back and unvaulted so we get 3 different shotguns. I feel like it's healthy for the game to not get 1 shotted by shotguns if you're at 200HP, I feel like CLOSE to 200HP is fine but 220 Headshots were unhealthy for the game in my personal opinion it just isn't ideal for a gun to be able to do OVER the maximum player health, just like the heavy sniper.. The heavy i am unsure if it did over 200 but most of the time it really didn't and pro's and most experienced players preferred the pump over the heavy any day no matter the rarity, but non the less it was still pretty damn good just not as good as the pump but it's more of a fair gun because it still hits hard and pretty accurate just not as much damage as the pump but still quite a bit of damage, def more than the tac and combat shotgun, over 100+ damage is always pretty neat. This is my opinion on the season 9 meta, feel free to leave down your opinion below.",FortniteCompetitive

There are a few point that I want to talk about:
- Huge changes every season: the concept that every season needs to be unique isn’t totally wrong for me, but what I don’t understand is why they change so much. Vaulting pump shotgun imo is the craziest thing they have ever done. The pump is the iconic weapon of this game. In close range/build fight, which are the core of this game you need a slow fire high damage weapon, especially if you are playing against a good player, you will have 1/2 chances to hit before he turtles. This new combat shotgun is actually shit, nobody wants to spam with a shotgun

- Casual player vs Competitive player: let’s say I’m not an actually pro player, but I want to play the competitive mode and tournaments of this game in a decent way. If they want to make happy both the sides, they have to treat them in different ways. Competitive players wants a solid game, based around some essential characteristics that need to stay there forever and not being changed every 2 weeks. In a competitive mode the purpose is to reduce RNG as much as possible. What epic seems to do is “fuck those competitive/hardcore players, let’s change everything that is good in this game”
Instead of bringing in new bad items, Epic should fix the game and make it more responsive and playable. 

When I see some statements from Epic,like the ones they made on Siphon or even about the pump, I feel like they never actually play this game and if they do, they are bots.
SKILL should dominate in the game, they are fighting against skilled players in every way, and I don’t understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Neo Tilted &amp; Mega Mall:** Due to their restructure, there will probably be about as many people going to these drops as before, and they will both retain their status as the throwaway-game spots. If you're willing to put in the time to learn one of these quickly, it could benefit you early in the season. Rotations are also a literal breeze now due to the wind tunnels.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Loot Lake:** Most of the buildings have been futurized, but I wouldn't expect a huge impact in terms of gameplay outside of the wind tunnel offering easy rotations. There are also a few trees added around the middle of the lake that should help give that area some much-needed materials &amp; cover.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Pressure Plant:** Pretty solid new POI with good wood &amp; metal, decent loot, &amp; easy rotations. Should be more contested than the volcano was &amp; a more interesting (but still annoying) endgame circle.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Junk Junction:** Basically, it was minimally rearranged. Nothing major except that it will be annoying to get that one chest.

&amp;#x200B;

* **John Wick's mansion:** Calamity found herself a man with money, as her humble ranch has been upgraded to an expansive mansion. This spot now has 5 chests, including a triple-spawn in a hole in the basement, and some coconuts for a little shield. Expect to be contested more here, and people on the east side of Paradise should watch their backs a bit more closely.

&amp;#x200B;

* **4 out of 7 Pirate Camps removed:** The only ones remaining are the two in the jungle &amp; the one by Pleasant; the others have been reverted to their original form. The biggest impact will probably be that the 3 or 4 people every game who used to land on a baller at desert bridge or Fatal mountain will now be contesting other mass-baller spots.

&amp;#x200B;

* **All pirate cars removed**: The area hardest hit by this is the junkyard by Paradise, which lost 3 chests, a baller, a quad, and some insane metal sources. A couple other low-key areas like the Lucky bridge &amp; the upper-east side of Frosty are less viable drops now.

&amp;#x200B;

* **A few geysers removed:** Almost all of the jungle geysers remain, but all of the other ones have closed up. In most cases, there are wind tunnels or floating platforms nearby that should be good replacements, but the one place that will definitely miss its geyser will be the GUS racetrack.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Rabbit out, whale in:** The house north of Snobby will return to being nearly-useless without the 2 chests that the rabbit on the hill used to offer, while Yellowstone got a buff of 2 more chests &amp; one more area that actually offers cover of some sort.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Literally 2 ziplines removed:** If your rotation includes a zipline over to the Durrburger for a rift, consider yourself warned.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Wind tunnels:** Early &amp; mid-game, these should help lessen the RNG of circles since they are pretty accessible to &amp; from anywhere on the map. With that said, it might be smart to avoid them midgame if you can since the areas around them will likely be pretty crowded. In the endgame, expect to see people lining up next to these for free rotations.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Floating platforms**: These will have a similar effect as the wind tunnels since they are well-spaced throughout the map, and when you combine the two, rotations have never been easier. If one of these is in an endgame circle, it will be the most prime spot in the zone. It's also worth noting that like other ""mobility spots"" in previous seasons, these have 3 chests apiece, so they are decent landing spots for those who like to rotate early.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Windmills:** Found exclusively on mountains in the NW part of the map, these offer both a chest &amp; a baller. Places like the old villain base by Snobby, the haunted castle, and the expedition outpost by Pleasant (which apparently needed one more baller for good measure) are all buffed thanks to these, so expect more traffic. There are even a couple random mountains in that area that you could now make an argument for dropping to.",FortniteCompetitive

That means that whenever people claim Epic is taking the wrong approach, everybody and their sister jumps and says 'well, the money is in casual, so can you really blame them for catering to that population?'

What people fail to realize (and that is the frustrating part) is that they don't have to cater to one community while neglecting the other. When we realized ballers are pretty much free end game, or any other item that doesn't suit competitive gameplay, it was *never* either vault it (or don't release it to begin with) and make the comp community happy while the casuals will suffer no new content and fun items, and neither was it keep it and make the comp community frustrated.

No, there was no need to make it all about a win-lose situation (or vice versa, for either side). It can simply be a win-win situation, with both parties content. Why not keep ballers as is, but disable it in Ranked and tournaments? The same goes for any other change/addition to the game that makes absolutely no sense competitive-wise. Separate loot pool &amp; feature mode can easily be done by Epic and they choose not to take this path.

Why? Why not choose to keep the comp players as happy as the casual players? You don't have to compromise. Listening to the comp community does not equal displeasing your casual community. That is one thing that most people who justify Epic fail to realize. sure, let's say 99% comes from casual money being poured in. Do you really think they casual players care not having ballers in ranked/tournaments? Or that shiny new item that gets released every so often? Of course not, they couldn't care less, because they couldn't care less about this mode, and that it the only mode it's absent from. Same goes for every change and item that don't belong in comp.

So **tl;dr**: please stop justifying Epic for no reason. Having a majority casual player-base does not mean they cannot balance the game competitive-wise. They can easily have two separated loot pools. They simply choose not to do so. Clearly little Timmy does not care about Arena or participating in tournaments. He plays Team Rumble, or the default playlists, at best. Please stop talking nonsense.

I used to kinda brag about [this WhatsApp message](https://i.imgur.com/AsOVguG.png), Oct 1st, 2017. FNBR was about a week or two old or so, and if you roughly translate it to English, it reads:

&gt;The Culling was surprising as well, but unknown developers who had screwed the game

&gt;This time around, it's Epic Games who have made Unreal (the engine and the game), I had no clue it was them

&gt;Just a couple days ago they uploaded their first video form dev update, in the style of Jeff Kaplan from the Overwatch team

&gt;Not only is it a free game, but it also works on garbage GPUs, such as Daniel's (a friend), and stable as well.

&gt;PUBG's annoying, after a game and a half everybody leaves.

It was during the PUBG era, when it had started to break all kinds of records and no game could even stand even remotely next to it. I was right (as far as popularity goes), but for the wrong reasons. I've given them way too much credit as far as transparency (dev updates) and overall development goes.

From everything I'm reading, three points stand out that together paint - in my opinion - a really excellent picture of what shotguns are supposed to be and why:

&amp;#x200B;

**1)**  [**Shotguns are used so much because Fortnite is a close-range game**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bmlyt2/epic_the_reason_the_pump_accounted_for_so_many/) **- due to building and bloom.**  
This isn't a bug, it's a feature, and it's fair. You would have to remove one of those two in order to truly change this.

**2) The potential to one-shot is good for Fortnite.** *(someone find this post, I lost it)*  
To make fights interesting, (1) you should always be able to come back if you play \*perfectly\* and your opponent makes a critical mistake, and (2) you should always be a little afraid of anyone not dead, and still have to make sure you outplay them through the finish line.

**3)** [**One-shots should only be possible from excellent play**](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bmmdin/why_a_10_pellet_80828486_base_damage_25x_headshot/)**.**  
This post provides a great solution: no shotgun should body shot for over 99, and every shotgun should be able to 1-shot if the player lands a perfect 10-pellet headshot.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'all are smart. All of these points are excellent, and I think there's a fair balance here. I know nothing will happen because Epic, but there's a great potential here for truly understanding what should be and why.",FortniteCompetitive

The gun has amazing range and consistency, you don't need to be barrel stuffing people for it to be effective. It's relatively weaker up close which is where the pump would come into play.

Honestly though if epic ever brings back the pump, leave the combat in the game. The tac has literally been useless for all 9 seasons of fortnite unless you want to include pump+tac.

I am (not to sound like a douchebag) kind of a popular kid at my school.  Ever since I got my PC I haven’t been to many parties or been out with my friends as much as i usually would. I would often decide to not go hang with my friends because of wanting to play or watching a stream.

My mom had been getting on me about grades. I usually would pull it out and maybe fail one class and have to make it up next year. But I am a senior this year. There is no next year. For the whole semester I have missed a total of 220 periods.

My day would usually consist of waking up at 10am and going to one or two classes and then leaving and going home and grinding scrims or 1v1s.

MR SAVAGE DROPS A 40 Bomb and other pros with good mind sets for adapting quickly have all been dominating even more than before. 


Movement for days, so I’m not reliant on getting items to rotate safely of burning my mats heavily to get to a good position, I can choose to fight for it, but at the same time the air vents aren’t OP. Movement items are now not as OP and necessary to have. 

No lucky one pumps or people hitting lucky shots for 100+ as they die. As well as getting rid of the massive rng of if someone got a pump off of landing you would have to tremendously out skill them to have any chance of winning. 

Faster more dynamic paced combat in terms of flow and fighting for position. Reinforced high ground pushes are more essential as kids who just 90 with no regards to structural integrity of what there building up on are getting shot down. 

Two Viable shot gun metas, if your actually good at this game the new shotgun is insane at midrange peeks against sprayers and is so good for flick and build shots, plus small spread makes accuracy way more crucial. Got rid of a bunch of trash items so most guns you pick up (most there’s still trash ones obviously) are actually viable enough to give you a chance of survival. Plus shotgun to smg is balanced, I can actually decide whether shooting shotgun twice or an smg switch is the play. Overall more viable metas so more tactics can happen.

I think this season actually raised the skill gap. Good luck to Bots out there who relied on turtling in boxes to try to get pump peeks, your gonna have to adapt or keep believing this game is catering towards casuals and that’s why your not successfull. This season is going to be way more dynamic",FortniteCompetitive

While the next gun may not have been close, it’s fucking moronic to compare a gun that is the only viable option in its class to other guns that have multiple viable options in their class.

In this game we had 5 main classes of weapons 

1) ARs (AR, AK, Infantry Rifle, suppressed AR)

2) Shotguns (pump/tac)

3) SMGs (silent sub, P90, Tommy gun) 

4) Pistols (pistol, silent pistol, Deale)

5) Snipers

Note - I left out explosives (low quantity), throwables and traps as I’m trying to focus on weapons. 

When considering the pump clearly outclassed the TAC, making it the only viable shotgun, it is not fucking surprising it accounted for roughly 1/4 of eliminations. I’d love to know how that % stacks up against all ARs or all SMGs. 

Snipers are a niche weapon and pistols fucking suck besides the deagle, leaving us with 3 main classes of weapons to kill people with (ARs smg and shotgun). With that in mind, doesn’t it seem perfectly normal that the only viable shotgun accounts for 26% of deaths!?

After the age of double pumps (which, considering the range, speed and damage was hilariously OP), we had two variants of the pump that did 90/95 base damage with a 2.5x headshot multiplier, firing 10 pellets. In all consideration, even though this was still OP in my opinion, this was the best variant we have seen thus far. My main problem with this is the base damage was too high, but this was the closest we got to balanced/skillful shotgun.

On June 6th, 2018, there was a hotfix to change the headshot multiplier from 2.5x to 2.0x, and the base damage to 80/85, removing the ability to 1-pump people. This was interesting, because for the first time, it felt like pumps weren't OP, but also required a pretty good amount of skill to use effectively. Time-to-kill was higher than ever, and it still felt like outplaying people and taking little damage in a fight was possible, even at the highest skill level.

On November 27th, 2018, there was patch 6.31, which significantly changed pump shotguns. The range decreased, but base damage changed to 95/100 for green/blue, and the Epic/Legendary variants were added with base damage 105/110. I absolutely hated this change, and have thought shotguns were way too OP (in all the wrong ways...110 is just way too much for a full body shot). Not only was early game RNG at an all-time high by finding a blue/purple/gold shotgun for a 1-shot kill on someone without shield, but 1-pumping someone was dependent on what shotgun you had, and with the gold you could one-pump someone without even hitting all headshot pellets. It made getting the best variant of the shotgun insanely beneficial in fights, such that RNG played a huge role in deciding fights.

Now, in patch 9.0, we have the combat shotgun, with 73/77/81 base damage and a 1.7x headshot multiplier giving us a maximum damage of 124/130/137. In a way I'm happy the 6.31 pump meta is gone, but on the other hand, what we have now is so much worse. Headshots are barely rewarded, and in fact we may need to consider not even going for headshots at certain ranges (aim at neck so more pellets hit).

This brings me to what the perfect shotgun for competitive Fortnite is. It is a shotgun with a pump-esque range, 80/82/84/86 base damage, a 2.5x headshot multiplier, and 10 pellets. This allows all pumps to 1 pump when you hit all 10 pellets at close range, but doesn't allow the best shotgun to 1-pump with 9 headshot pellets and 1 body shot pellet. The base damage for all shotguns are &lt;100, such that you can't 1-pump someone in the body off spawn. Additionally, headshots are rewarded more than they currently are, creating a more skillful shotgun.

I know this falls on deaf ears at Epic because of their low competitive integrity, but a man can still dream.",FortniteCompetitive

Here’s the thing, in another game, that would mean that the weapon is overpowered, but not for Fortnite.

Fortnite is unique with the fact that it is a shooter game where you can CREATE your own cover through building, unlike games such as Apex. A result of this is that Fortnite has and always will heavily revolve around close-range fighting, as you can easily close the distance between you and an enemy using builds. Adding to this, long or mid-range fighting is not ideal in Fortnite due to bloom and the fact that you can create cover. It is always preferable in Fortnite to kill someone at close range.

This is the reason why the pump accounts for such a large percentage of the kills. The Tac would be around the same region but they left it in the dust as a poorly balanced gun and was super underpowered and outclassed on every level by the pump. Claiming that vaulting the pump because it was used for 26% of all kills is equivalent to vaulting building because it was used as well in almost every kill. Pumps, and other close range weapons, cater to the core mechanics of Fortnite and Epic doesn’t seem to realize this.

Yeah. Pump wasn’t OP. It was only used so much because it’s the most effective way to play Fortnite with how the game itself at its core works.",FortniteCompetitive

Obviously the most unique gameplay mechanic in Fortnite is the building. But the reason build fights were enjoyable is because there is a high-risk high-reward nature to them. Getting a shot off at the opponent meant potentially being exposed. But the high-damage potential meant the trade-off was worth it. No-one enjoys sitting in a one-by-one while somebody empties all their small ammo on them, and usually this only last for a little bit, until an offensive play with the pump could be made.

The pump, if wielded skillfully, had the potential to one shot a close-range opponent. It’s relatively slow rate of fire (and draw speed) emphasized skillful use, and punished mistakes. It was by no means perfect, but the chance to be at 10 health and still win a fight close-range made the weapon a fantastic compliment to building.

The pump allowed advanced building to evolve because if used effectively, would beat a spray and pray tactic. It forced movement and reduced turtling as the only legitimate defensive strategy in a fight. It allowed a high-energy fight with stakes the entire time.

However, without a high-damage close-range weapon like the pump, the new meta is likely going to be “overwhelming firepower” (AKA Hold m2 down and pray your ping is better than your opponents and can slip bullets through turbo build). This meta will punish legitimate build fights. Why leave a box and perform risky maneuvers when even if you hit your opponent, it will do negligible damage and they’ll immediately box up? Build fights will take longer, will be far less rewarding, and third parties are going to increase significantly. 

Effective game design has three simple rules for engaging game-play: 1, the winner of a match (in this case a 1 on 1 fight) should not know they are the winner long before actually winning (i.e. they won’t be 98% sure they will win the match if they hit the first few shots). 2, There should always be a chance for a comeback, with increasing risks (i.e. one-pumping your opponent while at low-health). 3, the split between skill and luck should be somewhere between 75:25 and 90:10 (hitting headshots in high-pressure situations). 

Without the pump, build fights fail every single one of these rules. RIP the pump, RIP Fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

Skill-based matchmaking in arena doesn't function properly. There was already an example of Ninja and Tfue running into each other with like a 600 Hype difference. But just from my personal experience. It doesn't feel like I'm running into players that are *at* my skill level. I'm at 305 Hype and consistently run into players that are *leagues* above me in skill. I don't mind, and in fact, enjoy, fighting someone better than me. But a player who has 900 Hype making an alt just to stomp people in lower Hype arena is ridiculous and it's happening fairly regularly. Just go on Ghost Innocents' Twitch and watch some VOD's where he's done it, same with Upshall, and I'm sure many others. How has Epic not addressed how easy it is to make a smurf account? There have to be better ways to play with people closer to your skill level. This would solve a lot of issues here. 
2. Just as important as the first point, as many have pointed out here, we desperately need a different loot pool in arena. I get that Epic wants the lower skilled players who watch Tfue and Ninja to see them destroying people with the new Combat Shotgun or the Boom Bow but it just *isn't* competitive. Epic is trying to force noncompetitive items and metas into Arena which was designed to be ***different from pubs***. And we know that they *can* do different loot pools quite easily, they're just choosing not to purely from a money-making and marketing standpoint without any indication that they care about the competitive experience in a ranked mode that *they* designed.",FortniteCompetitive

But I'm not so sure about this, here is a tentative analysis to show that this is probably going to increase the skill gap, as the longer the engagement (more shots to kill needed), the chances for a good player to come on top increase.

Let's take the example of two good players:  
\-Very good player (VGP): Headshot with pump: 7 out of 10 shots  
\- good player (GP): Headshot with pump: 6 out of 10 shot

VGP is able to aim and shoot slightly quicker than GP, so he will shoot first 6 out of 10 times.

Season 8, 1 headshot needed to end the fight, probability to win :

\-VGP: 0.7x0.6=0.42 probability

\-GP: 0.6x0.4=0.24 probability

VGP will come up on top 1.75 time more often than GP.

Season 9, 2 headshots needed to end the fight, probability to win :

\-VGP: 0.7x0.6x0.7x0.6=0.1764 probability

\-GP: 0.6x0.4x0.6x0.4=0.0576 probability

VGP will come up on top 3 times more often than GP

Conclusion, this change will increase the skill gap.

They always have. Hell, if you go back to earlier footage of when the BR was first being played, that’s how it was played. However, over time the game transitioned into rushing towards people with effective builds to hit your opponent with a hard hitting shotgun shot and finishing them off with a spray weapon.  

Why did this even happen in the first place? I believe that, ironically, the one thing that helps Epic market it towards people of all skill has been hindering them from actually being able to balance the game competitively (and this is a very important phrase I’m going to say here) around what they want Fortnite to be: bloom. With bloom, you can’t “just aim better lul” to get your eliminations. Instead, you either tap fire your assault rifle if your opponent is far, or you spray if your opponent is relatively closer. However, in both scenarios the opponent has more than enough time to build cover for themselves (sans glitches/lag or some blessed RNG with your spray). In comes shotguns: a weapon where the only limiting factor is how well you can aim, and can guarantee TONS of damage (shoutouts to Phreak). In terms of game mechanics, it makes sense that the better/competitive players would gravitate towards shotguns: no RNG, all skill. The one issue was closing the distance between your opponent, and building served that purpose, transitioning from being a mostly defensive option to a mostly offensive option.

Epic’s game isn’t being played how they intended. So, where did that leave them? They could have just adapted (the irony here is palpable) and possibly create the best e-sport EVER based on how the best of the community was playing it, or they could try to “fix the game” to force it to fix their mold and possibly guarantee the casuals keep playing the game. I guess we all know which path they chose. 

Epic has been very clear about nerfing builds in the past to make spray weapons better, but it removed the tactical element of actually using builds to defend yourself (shoutouts to day 1 P90). After that didn’t work they slowly started nerfing shotguns (not counting that, prior to the build nerfs, double shotty meta was killed). The double barrel was an attempt to bring back a hard hitting shotgun, but combining it with other items made it OP.  So, Epic finally decided to forcibly end the “shotgun meta” by vaulting the pump. Given what their goal for the game is, it was the absolute best thing they could have done. Again, GIVEN WHAT THEIR GOAL IS, they should have vaulted the pump much sooner. It gives us, the player who wants to be the best, an avenue to make sure that Little Timmy doesn’t out-RNG us, and it might drive him away from the game.

Personally, I think that Season 9 is the first big step of Epic redirecting the game to where they want it to be, and, unfortunately, we (the competitive players) are Epic’s worst thorn in their side. Our view of the game is diametrically opposed to theirs. Of course, they wanted to try to appeal to both the casual and the competitive players, until they finally realized that we aren’t even 1% of the playerbase, despite being the loudest group against their view of the game. If we ALL quit, new competitive players will arise and (maybe) be content with the direction Epic is taking the game. So, Epic can literally afford to have us flock to CSGO or any other competitive game (I’ve been dedicating my time to becoming a better fighting game player, and I can’t recommend you enough to try it if you want a 1v1  where it’s almost entirely about skill and outplaying your opponent). If you want to continue playing this game competitively,  I suggest you drastically re-think how you look at this game, because it’s what Epic wants you to do.

Yes, the pump was very good to stomp on bots -- but we don't care about that here. In pure competitive plays, there's an argument to be made that it decreases the skill gap. 

First, if on landing your opponent found a pump but you didn't, the chance of making it alive were slim, regardless of the skill gap between you and that player. That's bad.

Second, in late game where things get messy, if an average skilled player lands in your box or meets you low ground and kills you there's no counter. You get one pump and ciao. 

Third, overall the game will be more ""tracking aim"" - based now, which I think requires more skill then just a flick -- although that's debatable.

shotguns, specifically pumps, were one of the CORE elements to this game and were one for the reasons that I loved playing so much. Mine, and many others, best memories playing this game are getting into exciting close combat build fights, seeing who can outplay the other and hit the pump headshot. This is at the core of what makes fortnite enjoyable to me and I think the gravity of the pump being removed will start to be realized by longtime players after only a couple of days..

It’s obvious Epic didn’t like the pump because the casual player didn’t like the pump.. the pump widened the skill gap and we know they are looking for small opportunities and avenues for making the skill gap smaller in order to cater to the casual player.

I believe that this is the BIGGEST change in the patch and it may not seem like that big of a deal right now, I guarantee in a few days once the glimmer of the new patch wears off that many will be echoing my statements.

I literally know nothing at all about building a pc. My budget is like 700-1000 dollars. With this budget what’s the frames I could get and could you guys help me out with good parts to get.,FortniteCompetitive

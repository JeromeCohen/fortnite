Jk it was probably posted once before. Everytime, you play and the entire game is a build off against the those who build the Empire State building in .2 seconds or even the great wall of china in .3 seconds. Every game is nothing but try hards who think they're going to join faze if they out build you. Well here is the unpopular opinion to fix this issue. Get rid of the ""LTM"" game modes that aren't actually ""LTM"" anymore. These split up the casuals and the try hards significantly. Back in season 3 LTMs weren't always there. There would be days with only Solo, Duo, and Squads. Those were considered the good ole days to a lot of people. Why? Because there weren't as many try hards. Now all we have is Chads who think if they win their 696th game faze is going to be knocking on their door.   


Don't get me wrong I love LTMs as much as the next guy. However, it has split the community completely and created tryhards and the casuals. I hate having to have 16 build fights a game to get a win. I'd much rather play the game casually and have a good time without having to play LTM's....   


Let me know what you think on this issue. I believe this is the easiest way to fix it rather than capping the mats... ",FortNiteBR

The earthquake was recorded at 3:14pm and thats the usual time when the new season would be out to play. The earthquake resulted in a Tsunami which has been linked with pirates and boats in the teasers. The earthquake resulted in mass destruction so we might be seeing some places getting destroyed like the most recent crack going towards tilted. Now talking about the snakes ; at the time of earthquake, snakes move out of their nests and epic has been teasing that since the battle pass challange for ‘look for nests’ was released. The eggs in those nests did contain snakes!
Talking about the beasts that have been there with bananas in the teasers ; earthquakes destroy agriculture so on the battle royale map the beast wouldn’t find any food so bananas would be scattered around the map for its survival.

22,MathBrush,1551327504,avmrrm,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/avmrrm/the_reason_i_prefer_fortnite_over_other_shooters/,10,The reason I prefer Fortnite over other shooters is because it's not bloodthirsty,"I've never played shooters my whole (34 yr) life. Maybe a few times in a big group, but that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

I like fortnite because it's different from other games. It's not bloodthirsty. I'm not excited by the idea of decapitating someone, or seeing spurting blood. I saw an animation of Apex's 'executions' today and it made me feel sick. I don't mind violence in the service of story (I was a fan of Walking Dead), but 'violence as reward' just doesn't appeal to me.

&amp;#x200B;

With the holo-drones on 'death' and respawn modes, Fortnite feels about as bloodthirsty as chess or paintball. It's a fun battle of wits and skill, not a fight to the death.

&amp;#x200B;

I also love that you can do well in pop-up cups and challenges by being stealthy or by being a good builder. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of 'hard core gamers' hate Fortnite because of this. They want a 'grownup game' and equate shedding blood with maturity. And I'm more than happy if that kind of people leave to other games. ",FortNiteBR

A lot of my friends have been complaining about the amount of game ending since the update with added health/shield. Let's be honest, most people don't play with people of the same skill level, moreover, I find a lot of duos have 1 good player, 1 not so good player. In a duo match, most of my games usually end up with my friend getting killed off quickly, and then me by myself for most of the game.  Fortnite's a game that i've played with my friends more than any other game since the COD era (MW2, BO1, etc.) and I feel like rewarding players for finishing off other players is making this tougher to play casually with friends of different skill levels. I wanted to ask you guys what your thoughts were and maybe find some solutions to help both casuals and reward players for getting kills.

(Remember that these solutions are for duo/squads only, I think the update for solos works perfectly as is)

Possible Solutions:

1. Give the health upon the knockdown, not the game end. 

**Pros**: players won't thirst \*as much\* (there will always be thirsting, just take away players like me who only do it for the health at this point)

**Cons:** More third partying, might promote camping/sniping from far more instead of rushing.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Delay for x amount of seconds before you can thirst (still with health boost)

**Pros:** forces players not to thirst right away

Allows teammates to have a chance to save downed person (i.e was sniped in open, etc.)

**Cons:** Players aren't rewarded as quickly for killing/downing a player

&amp;#x200B;

3. Some sort of system like Apex where you can bring back dead teammate

**Pros:** Still allows that health boost

Dead players might actually not leave the game and stay to watch knowing they have a chance of coming back

**Cons:** needs to be balanced so not everyone can do it easily, and must put the teammates at huge risk 

We don't know how that would even work in Fortnite as it's never been part of the game

Huge unknown ?

&amp;#x200B;

Some other ideas that have been thrown around include adding an item for reviving in some way, added health to downed person so it's harder to kill right as they go down and a few others that I thought were more flawed than the ones seen above. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts!

You've provided **31/32** FIFA team skin options (excluding the default soccer skin) and forgot ONE of the most important ones to add to that list.

&amp;#x200B;

After they've shed blood, sweat and tears game after game for years with its ups and downs, we finally arrived to the World Cup 2018 after **36 years***.* 2017 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Rankings ranked us as a #11 seed in the World. **Peru**, recognized as having one of the most iconic soccer kits in soccer history, deserves to be added as a soccer skin option.

&amp;#x200B;

**Peru** deserved a soccer skin option as much as these other teams. A few of these teams didn't even make the World Cup and they still got a skin option! *cmonBruh* Below I name a few FIFA teams that have as much a fascinating story as **Peru** does but still, **Peru** did not make the cut. But why? WHY!

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking:** #42

**Australia** were in the same boat as **Peru** actually. Both **Peru** and Australia had to play and win their Wildcard games to advance to the Group Stage. They did. Australia did not advance or win a game in their Group Stage. 

They lost to **Peru** 2-0.

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking:** #56

**Egypt** qualified for the 2018 World Cup and it was their first appearance in **28 years** and third appearance overall. They lost all 3 Group Stage matches and were eliminated from the 2018 WC.

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking:** #37

**Iceland** became the smallest nation by population to ever clinch a FIFA World Cup berth when they qualified for the 2018 World Cup. It was their first appearance ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**2017 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking:** #122

**New Zealand**...

&amp;#x200B;

**New Zealand** and **Peru** faced off in the Wildcard Stage. Both teams had to play on their own turf and the winner of both matches advanced to the 2018 World Cup. First game took place in New Zealand. 0-0 was the final score. Peru later won 2-0 at home and sent New Zealand home and therefore New Zealand did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup but they get a soccer skin option?!?!

In the fortnite settings, it says my ping is 20 on NA-East

Futhermore, when I switch servers to NA-West, my ping is 50-60; this is what the settings says my ping should be. Currently, I've tried:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Restarting fortnite

\- Verifying fortnite

\-Restarting my computer

\-Restarting my router

\- Uninstalling fortnite

\-Banging my head against the wall

It’s aids watching someone full-kill you literally 2 seconds after downing you while watching them not care that they’re getting shot from behind for more than 50 health. Like is the 50 health worth it if someone’s gonna kill you or take 100 shield/health off of you while you’re thursting me? It’s ridiculous at this point. ",FortNiteBR

Anyways, this game is beginning to get frustrating. I understand it takes a while to get good at a game, but it shouldn't take months on end to develop skill. It also seems like Epic revolves the game around the streamers messaging them their complaints on twitter, which isn't fair if its true. I've gotten double digit squad wins, but 0 solo wins. I've been getting better at gun fights, but when i get to end game, i usually get picked off by someone who has double digit eliminations. I do need practice at building wars, however (although in squads i got LUCKY in a build war once. A squad attacked mine with a plane so I just kept building like crazy around us as the plane was shooting and the squad jumped. I ended up eliminating 2 of them.) And every once in a while theres that one person that has to ruin the fun and use some sort of cheat. I've died to aimbots at least twice that i can think of rn.

Now obviously I’m not saying there should be unlimited refunds because people would abuse that, but I had a couple ideas on how the system could be better: 
1.: You get a refund token every time you purchase v-bucks, thus eliminating just using the same v-bucks over and over
2.: At the beginning of every season you get x amount of tokens
3.: Every time an item or skin is in the item shop and you own it, it gives you an opportunity to return it. 

These are just some ideas I thought would make the system better thanks to anyone who read it all! :)

I don't think this is coincidental, and if my theory is correct there will be an X hidden on the Season 8 map, but the reward will be only obtainable by using the Cobalt skin. Cobalt is a datamined skin from January and thought to be in a upcoming starter pack. If my theory is true, Cobalt will not cost any V-Bucks. I think this is why the skin is called BlueMystery in the internal data.

Each and every solo match is filled with good players to some extent now. And while it is fun to compete, every game is a turtle war. 

You cannot rely on RNG AR shooting mechanics, so build rush, get your shotty ready, and then so many fights turn into one of us turtling up and either A) hold down M1 at every wall, floor, cone they try to replace or B) hope someone 3rd parties and gets them off of you/them depending on who is boxed up.

Creative 1v1s are fun because you just go at it and fight, respawn fight again. No need to box in. But that's not a BR. And truth be told, I have been so refreshed by Apex in that we as players cannot hide. Fights can conclude and you can move on.

For me, this is wearing thin, because looking over old clips, (yes we were all bad compared to now, I get that), but it reminded me how fun the game was without turbo building in it. Fights were actual fights and I almost wish the TB mechanic was never implemented. 

Sure, on console, spamming right trigger is annoying for people. But ironically, although TB was supposed to speed things up, all it has done is *slow things down.* Two good players going at it and it is 9/10 times sit in a box and wait. And this is getting really stale.

If we had to individually place every build, I think it would create a bigger skill gap. What about you?",FortNiteBR

Fortnite France posted on their Twitter with the last teaser of Season 8 ""Discover a whole new world"" So that's how I imagine it:

At the beginning of the trailer we will see Wailing Woods, suddenly a huge earthquake begins to happen, a huge volcano rises from the floor, and on the volcano stands The Prisoner, it controls the volcano and wants to destroy the world of the ice king because he wanted revenge on the ice king.

.He swings his hand with sword toward the snowy area on the map, and the volcano erupts and begins to destroy the entire map, just before the volcano covers the entire map in lava, you can see a port with many skins that we know, including pirates and skins from the battle pass, On a huge ship, and when the last person emerges, the island is completely destroyed and covered with Lava.

The ship is sailing in the sea, a great storm begins and suddenly a huge wave approaches and threatens the ship, the ship becomes entangled, sailing quickly and uncontrollably,

And then ... the ship crashes into a new island, where there is treasure and there will create new life, new cities and more.

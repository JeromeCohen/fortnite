So When I play Fortnite I average around 160-220fps, but even thought my fps is rather good I still experience a rather unsmooth game. Furthermore when I have drops and I get to 80-140fps I lag extremely much. As I have friends who have their games locked at 60fps and they have 0 lag, but when I lock mine at 60 or 144 it feels like Im playing with 20 (even thought it's very stable). When I lock it at 144fps The game feels a lot worse compared to letting it be on 200 or unlimited.   
Here are my specs:  
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB	  
Intel I7 6700k  
16GB Ram  
Monitor: 144hz acer predator. G-sync  
And something rather interesting is that when I play with a stretched resolution The fps gets better but the lag gets worse.  


PS. Iv already turned of v-sync, motion blur, and it's in fullscreen.  


I also lag a lot when i'm looking at tilted towers, would a cpu upgrade help this?

Thank you

For a game that's been out for over a year why are there still so many glitches and bugs? It's not like Epic doesn't have the resources to refine the game and they've had plenty of time to do it. I also still think the shooting mechanics are garbage. Little to no consistency at all. Not just accuracy but damage too. And is skill based matchmaking not a thing anymore?

I mained a frost mage regardless of ranking throughout my playtime. I looooooved going to see ice sculptures in the winter. I LOOOOOVED playing ice hockey with friends. All my life I've loved ice. As a science teacher it is even more intriguing as a solid being less dense than its liquid form. 

Back to fortnite. I have been saving my battle pass vbucks since season 3. Waiting and waiting for that one ice skin that I will use til the end of time. 

Then it happens. I am browsing reddit and see a leaked skin.....the ice sculpture cupid. I had that feeling we used to feel at Christmas as kids. Was telling my wife and fellow teachers that play how pumped I was for it and I would finally have the skin to match my ice themed gamertag I have been saving and waiting for. That is...until I recently found out it is in a bundle, and its cash only. With our first baby on the way every penny goes into savings and we live fairly frugally. I cannot stress the disappointment and roller coaster of emotions this skin has caused.

I know its not epics fault as it was leaked but being so hopeful for something and then seeing it sit behind a paywall is genuinely disappointing.

I hope this will not be a trend moving forward as it is a real slap in the face for people saving for skins.

1. Console aim assist. It is obvious that playing and aiming with mouse and keyboard is a lot easier than with console and I think it's fair that console players have a chance to aim assist. But as we think the current assist, I feel like it is more of an aimbot rather than an assist. It's obviously needed but in my opinion, it needs a nerf. Currently, console players don't have to do basically anything to get their shots to hit, they just stand still and press their aim button. I have had some console players saying themselves that the aim assist should be nerfed since it gives way too much of an advantage in aiming.
2. Planes. Fortnite is all about building and shooting, mainly the unique thing that brought fortnite up was the possibility of building. At the time I'm writing this, players who drive planes do have an insane advantage to players that are building on ground/build fighting. It makes no sense that a player that has no guns or basically nothing can destroy buildings in a matter of seconds no matter what material you are using. And it doesn't even have a good counterplay, it just drives through, dealing damage and destroying anything that comes across its path. I feel that this doesn't require any type of skill in the game and before the game had no planes, it required more skill to outplay your opponent. Of course, this could be related to RPG and other explosive weapons, but I don't see those guns as powerful as planes are.

To put the things in summary, I fell like the console aim assist should be nerfed, a lot and planes should be removed from the game. I truly think that there are a lot of players that share the same views and there can be posts related to this, I'm just too lazy to look them up.

Hopefully Epic understands what is good and what isn't

And just to mention, English isn't my main language so don't mind if the text isn't written with perfect grammar

For example, I got invited to play some squads with the popular kids in my class. I was very excited and eager to impress, as i grind creative building and playground at least 2 hours each day.  Well, me and the boys go to hot drop tilted and instantly I get downed and this guy scummily finishes me. Like cmon bro i do it to other people but why would you do it to me that‚Äôs not fair. Anyway i just put it down to him being a fake OG and moved on. 

Next game me and the bois drop tilted again, and once again i get downed within seconds because some retard fake default uses the broken plane and bebops me off the clock tower. 

The popular kids then kicked me from the playstation party and said they‚Äôll beat me up when i go to school again i‚Äôm so scared. 

Anyway the problem with the game is their‚Äôs to many actual retard kid tryhards. Like it‚Äôs just a casual game i just wanna come on and physically dominate some fake OGs with the planes but all i get are these retarderd kids that try hard on me like what are you doing you don‚Äôt have to kill me i clearly don‚Äôt have a weapon. Funniest part is i look up these kids that kil‚Äôl me and they‚Äôre all absolute garbage tier trash washed up players. I messaged one guy and said ‚Äú1 win trash player omegalol enjoy crying yourself to sleep this christmas‚Äù so that should teach him. but anyway guys please comment what you think about these actual minority try hard players. also i‚Äôm getting a stream set up for christmas so follow my twitch it‚Äôs in my name ",FortNiteBR

Maybe it's the research group in whaling woods since the giant rift ripped All of moisty mire and anarchy acres and technically tomato town from us. Since tomato temple wasn't from this time period it went back in time so maybe it can bring pre meteor dusty depot back?

First of all, we've asked for interaction key for a while now, and leaving the pathetic part aside that they aren't addressing it at all (or even acknowledging it), the fact that an interaction key wasn't planned as a default is mind blowing already.

Not only do they get in the way of fights and you find yourself boarding them with no intention, but even when you finally intentionally want to board them - you're pretty much gambling, because they might as well glitch you out or not work at all.

I just depended on one of them to get me to the safe zone, crossed the storm especially for that, and it didn't work . I tried twice, lost some HP to fall damage, and then it was too late and I died to the storm. If they weren't there, I would have made it to the safe zone in ease, as it was one of the later circles (I was quicker than the storm on foot).

These ziplines are only here to frustrate us. We don't need ziplines to frustrate us. We have those annoying planes hogging the air 24/7 (unless they decide to kamikaze). Please, if you can't adjust it so we'd have to press a key to interact with them, just take them out of the game. We're better off without them than in the state they're currently at. Please just let us have just one thing to be less frustrated about. ",FortNiteBR

But seriously why are console pop up cups mixed with pc players. I'm not salty about it and I'm waiting for the 'get gud' comments to come in but why are we all jumbled up together? It's not like there's a lack of players to fill the lobbies and personally I feel pc should stick with pc and console should stick with console.

Yes epic has made it easier for console players recently but I still feel like pc players should play against pc players and console should play against console.

As much as you want to say there's no difference between the two, there really is. That's just my opinion, I think the average pc player can do a lot more than the average console player. It's just much harder when you get into the higher points because it's mostly pc players you're against.

Is there a reason for the mix? Did I miss if in the patch notes or wherever they posted it? Just looking for a discussion so I can be educated on the subject rather than people throwing around pc v console hate. ",FortNiteBR

This theory comes from a few things ive noticed with the game recently.

First comes the tier 97 Battle Pass loading screen:

https://i.redd.it/wlrhpaz7p3621.png

&amp;#x200B;

This at first didn't mean nothing to me (Besides the fact that it will be my loading screen for the rest of this game's life)

But then the Unvaulted LTM came around and we got this peculiar image:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gdrbm1tap3621.png

The characters in the image seem to be fighting in what looks like Dusty Depot, which would be completely fine since it correlates with the LTM Theme...Until you start to realize that that isn't the Depot how we remember it.

1. There is a caution sign below Rukus that was never there before.
2. There two chest to the right of Brainiac that weren't there before
3. There is a Spider decoration(similar to the ones in Fortnitemares) above the Depot's door, which also was never there before.

I'm not saying that Epic will bring back the Depot or the OG Factories like they were in Season3&lt;, but it does seem like they have something prepared, this isn't the first time that they foreshadow a new place, Item or Skin in the Battlepass (Skull Trooper, InfinitBlad and the Haunted Hills castle were all in the battlepass before they released)

What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Now people not only expect an ""OG"" varient when an old skin gets re-released but they have been shown that there is merit to be upset about it and to be angry at Epic for bringing it back in the first place. They essentially said ""caring about how rare a skin is is totally valid, you deserve free stuff and to get special treatment because you started playing a couple months before everyone else, you *should* care about how 'OG' you are and we should be catering to you."" Basically they set a dangerous precedent by acknowledging those complaints and validated the sense of entitlement people feel because they have a certain skin.

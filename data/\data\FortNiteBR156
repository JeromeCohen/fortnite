Just was a thought that I had since I am hovering at 123 skins total.

This is where when the circle closes and if a specific limit of players isn't met, the players who have dealt the least amount of damage will start taking damage over a set time. In Epic Games' words:

 If a certain amount of players are remaining by the time the Storm finishes closing, a Storm Surge will activate. This periodically deals damage to players who have the least amount of damage dealt during the match.

* Circle 1: 60 Players Remaining
* Circle 2: 44 Players Remaining
* Circle 3: 30 Players Remaining
* Circle 4: 20 Players Remaining
* Circle 5: 16 Players Remaining
* Circle 6: 14 Players Remaining
* Circle 7: 12 Players Remaining
* Circle 8: 6 Players Remaining
* Circle 9: 2 Players Remaining

This could mean that if you worked your ass off to get into the top 20 or 10 and maybe top 2 and you are the 3rd player you could've got a good 7 kills but maybe because the other people got a few lucky shots you'd be put at a disadvantage. This will make trying to win more hard and frustrating. While not rushing people and landing somewhere quiet can be seen as not playing the game properly, it is how some choose to play. That's just a good strategy and a smart way to play the game. It will eliminate campers, but in reality there's nothing wrong with hiding out it's just playing it safe and having good strategic skills. This is based on luck too, you drop somewhere normally busy and there's no people there. What do you do? Lose the game apparently now. 

This update punishes people who play the game smart and it should be cancelled",FortNiteBR

I predominantly play casual large team modes because i play to de stress after long periods of study/work and ever since Food Fight ( make a huge base by collecting mats only for one default to come drop a dynamite and now all that is useless) and now Glider Nerf, it has been extremely stressful to say the least.

I am in no means good enough to engage in competitive related changes but at least let us casuals have fun while playing EPIC, Please.",FortNiteBR

Skill based matchmaking: Fortnite has definately become a competitive game with a lot of good players. I feel like it's almost necessary now for skill based matchmaking cause with the way people play nowadays it makes it very hard for casual people who cant put in a lot of time into the game to 1 win a game and 2 learn how to be better because when they come across a really good player they usually end up dying in seconds. The skill gap between players on fortnite is huge now, making it very unenjoyable at times to play the game. Not everyone has the time to become good at the game so players like that should be paired up with other players with similar stats theres enough players playing the game that lobbies wouldnt be short on players.

2. I only say this one due to all the heavy weapons being added in and that is 300 health ( 150 and 150) everything can pretty much melt you that has recently been added to the game I think it only makes sense to balance everything with more health.

NOTE: these are just suggestions that I believe would benefit the game I'm not complaining about I just want some feedback on what you guys think whether you disagree or agree. I dont want read toxic comments, ( cause god only knows how toxic the fortnite community already is) just feedback.",FortNiteBR

We‚Äôve had three types of end game circles each with their own positives and negatives, but none of them accomplished this goal imo. 

The OG circles (my fav) closed naturally allowing players to fight at the end, but also allowed for cheesy heal offs and high ground camping.

The structure destroying circles (my least fav) helped stopped turtling/camping, but were obnoxious and didn‚Äôt allow for natural fights. 

The moving circles (the ones we have right now) help stop heal offs and keep people on their toes, but are too RNG based and don‚Äôt necessarily allow for organic fights either.

In my opinion, combining the best two or even all three of these in the right way is the answer. Imagine if the final two circles went like this:

The first end game circle (we‚Äôll call it ‚ÄòThe Fighter‚Äôs Circle‚Äô) would start out big enough for a 4v4. (Let‚Äôs say 6 blocks in diameter?) This circle would slowly close, and would take at least a few minutes to close in to the last and final circle. Basically, this would be designed to allow a legit, organic feeling final fight between the last remaining teams/players. (Also, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see where the next circle is going to be to prevent camping). Then, after the Fighter‚Äôs Circle gets small enough (1 block in diameter?) the final circle would activate (we‚Äôll call it ‚ÄòThe Camper‚Äôs Circle‚Äô). There would be a 5 second count down before the structure destroying mechanic activated (a one time thing). After the structures get destroyed, The Camper‚Äôs Circle would slowly start moving and closing in simultaneously until disappearing. This would take a minute or so, and would obviously be designed to prevent camping and easy heal offs and force the last survivors to move and fight each other.

Thoughts? Ideas? Feel free to add anything or share your opinion about end game circles. ",FortNiteBR

At the lobby, you are congratulated and presented with a choice to get The Reaper Skin, The Black Knight, Take the L, or Floss. 4 choices... and you can get only 1.

Remember, the other 3 or other skins, will only be available again at Level 100 of Season 8! Tough Choice!

It's become increasingly less enjoyable when things are not going my way. The expectation of every round has gotten too high that my baseline round is unacceptable and I only feel happy on good rounds. There have been too many changes that I do not enjoy. I have won plenty of games and have had a ton of fun getting back into competitive online games, but I've hit a point where this game has become a chore. It's a time filler and an unenjoyable xp grind. 

So it's time to play less going forward. If you love the game, good for you, but I imagine others feel the way I do too. If you do, it may be time for you to take a break as well. It just doesn't make me as happy anymore. Does anyone else agree?",FortNiteBR

I suggest that mini gun should just do no damage because it was only added to destroy forts right???

&amp;#x200B;

As far as what I can see, the golden scar can be very consistent. The AK can be a great gun, if you have lucky bloom and hold longer for a headshot.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it ever worth taking an AK over a scar? I've seen streams do both ways. AK over scar or scar over AK. Me personally I like the AK but sometimes the random big bloom frustrates me. Golden scar just seems like the way to go. I've been going off rarity though, i'll take a golden AK over a purple scar. I'll take a golden silenced scar over a blue AK. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure how I feel about the silenced scar either...opinions?

Both are equal to me. 

I'm simply curious as to how many people here are just simply enjoying the game, enjoying the updates / patches / seasons / new mechanics as they come and are still generally hyped for wherever Epic decides to take their game. 

Granted I've only been playing since Season 4, I still feel as though I've played through an absolute ton of game changing updates and additions and generally have just enjoyed them all. 

Long story short, I think epic is a great company who have shown their community that they're listening more than most game companies do. And I for one and simply just excited to see where the game is headed. Thinking back to every single change they've made I can't think of one that has upset me in any way.

I feel like the double barrel, at least from epics eyes, was an attempt at making a purple and gold version of the pump, and when it wasn't quite what they wanted, they made this new shotgun coming out. The heavy has always been an upgraded tac, just with tighter grouping and higher dmg, but i feel like now that they are adding purple and gold pumps, they are going to end up making the spread slightly bigger for the Heavy and make it the purple and gold version of the tac. All of this is even more likely with the changes to the pumps damage and not the tacs in the next patch that was already announced.

So why is it hardly working on console, and especially at close distances, shotguns per say, we all know how awkward the shotgun fights are on console, and how PC owners players recognize (sometimes mock) console players just by their terrible aim. (Which yes at times is very hilarious)

But to me, that seems like it doesn't carry over any of our 2 plotlines. Which to me our A.I.M hunting Calamity (I think) and Durr Burger Vs. Pizza Pit War.

But what if in the last week, Epic Games gives us a lot of new story info that leads up to a surprising climax? This is how it would go.

Durr Burger, while trying to figure out how to re-open the Greasy Grove Location, decides to open up 2 more locations. One in Retail Row, and another in Tilted Towers. Since Pizza Pit doesn't really have any resturants anymore except for the Pizza Pit Food Truck, it would be like ten blows to the gut to have 3 locations, one being in **Tilted Flippin' Towers**. 

Since the Tomato's have gone full on crazy cult, I think that they would try to do anything to stop Durr Burger. This leads them to the abandoned Villain's Lair and the rift technology at the Wailing Woods Bunker. Their plan would to use the rifts, the new dynamite, and a spare rocket they found at the Villain's Lair to blow up Tilted Towers and turn it into Tomato Towers a.k.a Tomato Town stacked like, 10 times.

In all of this A.I.M on the behalf of the government is trying to capture Calamity because she seems to be the only one able to use the Cube Power all the time (based on her tier 5 clothing). A.I.M's also trying to find Drift, as he also seems to have simmilar affects to Calamity at Tier 5. Luckily for A.I.M, Calamity and the rest of the Season 6 skins find Drift adrift in the rift.

Calamity and the others were looking for Drift because they got hold of the Tomato's plan to blow up Tilted Towers and Drift might know how to use rifts to make Tilted not blow up because he's been in it all season. A.I.M also discovers the Tomato's Plan and seeing that blowing up a city brakes about every law imaginable, A.I.M's new job is to stop the rocket from turning Tilted Towers into Totaled Towers.

So they go to the Villain's Lair, ready to stop the Rocket from launching and destroying Tilted. The Rocket takes off before they could stop it. The Rocket goes directly to Tilted, until it's Tilted by Drift who had been smart and decided to move the Rocket moving the directory that the Rocket follows that was in Tilted to behind on of the rifts. The Rocket goes into the rift and Drift shoots about 20-30 rockets into the rift to finish the Rocket off.

The world is saved, the Tomato King is declared insane, and the government decides not to capture Drift and Calamity and instead focus on the little mini cubes at the corrupted areas.

Then the snowstorm hits and Epic does something else with the story.

You see why this is crazy? For this idea alone I should be in the Tomato Cult.

Also, instead of the government throwing Tomato King into the insane asylum, they send him and Tomato Temple back through the rift back to the Mayans. The area turns back into Tomato Town and everything is fine and dandy.

It effectively removes so much of the rest of the RNG nonsense of the normal gamemodes while keeping the core game mechanics, it's fantastic. All you need in this gametype is a hunting rifle, a pump, dynamite, materials, and a minimum of 91 health. It's simplified Fortnite, and it's so much fun.

**1)** Headshots from hunting rifles or pumps kill in one shot, body shots from either gun are gonna take multiple shots (if you have minimum 91 health, and medkits are everywhere regardless). Since there are no automatic weapons, picking shots and good aim are incredibly important. 

**2)** Building is super balanced. Nobody is gonna shoot your build down from a distance, but you can bet your ass that someone up close is gonna get dynamite it. It's a breath of fresh air from the normal gamemodes.

**3)** RNG is basically nonexistent since there are only 4 guns (which bloom largely does not affect) and you can only get shields from mushrooms or supply drops. You never have to worry about if your opponent's guns outclass you bc they almost always have the exact same loadout as you. 


To me, it feels like an extremely honest gamemode where kills feel well-deserved and everyone is on an even playing field from the moment they touch the ground until the end of the game. It's my favorite gamemode to date. So damn fun and rewarding. Great job, Epic.",FortNiteBR

I've been playing the competitive game mode every time it comes to live, and honestly I'm enjoying it far more than the standard game itself, just because of the life-gain/shield-gain. It's beautiful.


I honestly think this will solve many problems with the game, as it gives people far more of a chance to survive in the game and people won't have to be dependent on carrying/finding bandages/med kit/etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel the need to post this.

During the last year I've played quite a few matches, read a lot of stuff on the web and watched a decent amount of Youtube content. Fortnite is a big hit in 2018 !

What is really shocking for me is how much money is spend ingame by young people. I've been in gamechat with teenagers who have spend **hundreds of dollars on V-bucks**. This is rediculous and should be stopped.

All over the world we don't allow kids to go to the casino for example. But there is no law against making them addictive to a game where they think you need the latest skins to be the ""cool kid"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Here we also have a **responsibility as parents!** I have two kids, so I think I am allowed to speak from my experience.

When we play games in our family, everything which is bought in-game, needs to be earned in-game!

I teach my kids about the value of money. Converting money into V-bucks does not bring you any further in life.

Yes it will give you short term pleasure, but this fades quite fast after the rush is over. Then you need more V-bucks to buy the next hot skin which is released.

...Wait......this can be compared to? The kick you get out of using drugs.....and the addiction to it.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Kids\*\*\*

Be smart and save your money for better causes:

* Your first car
* Your first house
* Paying your bills when you move out of your parents house
* Paying for the education of your kids at a later stage in your life.
* etc, etc, etc.......

I know this entire post is controversial, as kids are the focus/target of the marketing machine from Epic Games.

I did support Epic by buying Save The World and this is the only money they will get from me.",FortNiteBR

499,Nootis_Kapootis,1543205602,a0fxf4,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a0fxf4/movement_rant/,1,Movement Rant,"I think the game in terms of movement should go like this and I will explain it all later. You run automatically and there need *no sprint animation* and the acceleration values should be higher. Also, allow running sideways. Everyone could do that if they are physically able to.¬†If you want to walk and be a bit more stealthy, either press shift to stand around and walk (like when you don't press shift) or crouch around. And a small plead to make some weapons faster in your acceleration so you can outmanuver a scar spammer with a pistol/shotgun.

Now why the (S W E A R W O R D) would we want this? You see, lets think logically for the running. This is a battle royale. They want to be on their feet due to how easily they can die and how they can always be spotted. Walking should only be for sneaking and as last resort when you want to be s o r t o f quiet. Not completely. I want people to be able to instantly start moving when getting spammed or when someone is stationary but somehow has a heavy AR and a scar (happened to be too many times) instead of slowely walking left and right and trying to build spam leading to no resources. They can just run around and jump instead of having to spam build and retaliating with 500 mats instead of a quick snipe or rifle to the head. And yes, I am considering the scavenger mode for this one. Another case of better movement helping is when someone is hard peeking you with a sniper at a close range. I want to punish them for being immobile and quickly run, shoot, and hide with a pump shotgun. Instead, you take 157 damage and die while he takes 60 and uses a mini shield.
The sniper in this game either have the same movement, or they function like the cs:go snipers that a projectile based, faster speed, and no drop. Basically, you have to make a full stop to be 100% accurate and any movement with no compensation in it (crouching, stopping your current acceleration with friction or moving the other way) will lead to bloom in your snipers (reeeeee) in exchange for better movement.",FortNiteBR

I noticed that many players gets very tilted when you say so. Like it is a thing that shouldn't be done. 

I have to admit that I do that 60% because I like to hear them suffer&amp;tilt while losing the last hope to come back in game (I'm a bit an asshole, but yo ma'man... You have been outplayed, you deserve to be sent back to the lobby). It might also happen that when the fight was really though a little teabag/dab/bm could also slip in. I might be the only bastard that does this, but I don't think that's actually the case :P

The other 40% is due to the fact that I don't see any motivation not to do that. 
Better, the only time I might think of letting the knocked down player alive is when I can use it as a bait for his teammates. 
Other than that it has no sense to me. 
Many time the opponent, knowing that he's in numerical disadvantage, and knowing that he has lost the possibility to get his partner back, will decide for a retire, or just goes all in. Which often brings him to death. 

So why some people gets so tilted when you say that you finish off the downed enemies? Why aren't you supposed to do that?

I love this game, but ever since the addition of the new locations I have slowly lost interest. Not because of the countless bugs, those I can put up with, but because of how insanely boring the mid game is now. Unless you land at tilted towers a 10+ kill game in any mode is a rarity. I have around 190 wins with a 17% win percentage in each mode, so while I'm not amazing, I'd like to think I'm pretty decent and before this update have loved just landing anywhere on the map and knowing that if I was aggressive throughout the game I could rack up high kills. That just isnt the case anymore. I'll land at Retail Row, do nothing but sprint into the open all game and win with 5-8 kills. Having 1/3 of the lobby land at one location is just so bland. I know the response to this will be ""get gud"" which is the only reason I included my stats in this post but regardless of that I shouldn't have to land at one location every damn game just to see people. I think Tilted Towers is twice as big as it should be and throws off the tempo of the entire map.
I know there is zero chance of Epic scaling it down because of it's popularity and the growth of the game since it's release but man do I wish people agreed with me on this.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;


Today we’ll discuss how to survive the early game. Since starts can vary heavily, I think it’s important to understand the basic mindset which can be applied to any situation. 


&amp;nbsp;


**As always, video link in the comments If you don’t wana read**


&amp;nbsp;


**PART 2: SURVIVING THE EARLY GAME**


&amp;nbsp;


1.	**ITEMS YOU HAVE PICKED UP.** You need to understand what you picked up. Did you pick up a sniper inside a building or a pump shotgun in an open field? General rule of thumb is that Shotguns and submachine guns are very good in close quarters. Revolver, grenade launcher, crossbow, scoped rifle, burst rifle, snipers and the minigun are not. Silenced pistol, pistol, Silenced SMG, assault rifle, Scar fall in the medium range. They aren’t the worst but they aren’t the best. The opposite applies when you are in areas with lots of open space. Ok so you picked up a gun that’s good for the situation you are in. Did you pick up a potion? If so, do you have time to drink it? This will vary with each situation but drinking potion or healing puts you at risk in the short term but will give a better chance of winning the first engagement. Remember in the early game that every little advantage helps. If you can get your hands on decent close range weapon AND a medium range weapon, that’s a big plus! Also, if you have lots of items and some time, feel free to adjust them so you can easily switch between your best weapons. Those mili-seconds between weapons switches in combat can make a world of difference. 


2.	**WHERE IS EVERYONE AT?** As you were landing, you took a quick 360 turn to get a general idea of where everyone landed. I can’t stress the importance of having a quality headset so you can hear exactly where your enemies are moving and even what they picked up. If you listen carefully you might hear them switching between guns. If you are in a building and hear your enemy switching to a shotgun and you picked up a sniper, it’s time to get some distance between the two of you or get a different gun (if possible). If it’s the opposite, it might be a good idea to rush your enemy before they pick up a better weapon. High ground is also extremely important and if you can get it, you are adding another element to the list of advantages you potentially have. High ground is important because it gives your enemy less of a target to shot at and it gives you more of a target to shot at. Another important thing to keep in mind is which enemies are your priority. Do you see a guy that’s a mile away from you? Don’t waste bullets on them unless you absolutely must. Bullets in the early game are very valuable and even if you were to kill that enemy, you won’t be able to get collect their resources anytime soon. Focus on what’s closest to you and your biggest threat.


3.	**WHERE TO AIM.** At the start, I’d recommend just trying to hit your target and staying behind some cover if possible. You’re ultimate goal should be to aim for the head. If you enjoy numbers like me and would like to learn exactly how much damage each gun does, fire rates, reload times, etc… this is a good document to look over: Link in comments


4.	**TO CROUCH OR NOT TO CROUCH?** In close quarter combat, I don’t think crouching for accuracy is necessary. If you are trying to work an angle or sneak up on your enemy then by all means do it. I think it’s more important to move/jump around and make it difficult for your enemy to hit you. If we are talking about medium range or long range then you should definitely crouch if you can. 


5.	**IT’S A TRAP!** Be mindful of traps. This goes back to having a good headset and hearing exactly where a trap is placed. If you aren’t sure about moving thru a certain location, destroy it or go around it. Don’t forget the environment is destructible and there are always multiple paths to the same destination.


6.	**LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.** If you die in the early game, don’t get discouraged but try to think back or look at recorded footage if you have it. Sometimes the odds are just stacked against you, other times your aim could have been better, or you should have forted up, or secured high ground. There is always ways to improve.


7.	**LETS LOOK AT SOME FOOTAGE.** There is a lot to this lesson so I think it will be a lot easier to look at some footage and discuss what’s happening in these situations: Link in the comments.


&amp;nbsp;


As always, if you think I’ve missed something, let me know. Last week user Mikepook left this comment which is interesting:

“Mikepook - 15 points 4 days ago -
This is a great post, I do have one point I want to make. Imo the best way for beginners to get better is to get in as much gunfights as possible. Since gunskill is such an important aspect of the game. I would suggest beginners to land in the cities”

I agree to a certain extent. An analogy for where to land in Fortnite is kinda like weight lifting at a gym. Too little weight, and you won’t see results for a while. Too much and you might get an injury. But the right amount will provide optimal results with minimal chance of injury. This is exactly like landing in area with no one. You won’t really improve your gun combat skills, building skills, etc… until you come across other players. If you land in area where you are overwhelmed with enemies, you won’t really learn much if you are constantly getting killed. Landing in an area where you are comfortable but still being tested is what you are looking for.

I love Fortnite and Epic really do great job.

However I have to mention this. 

Dear Epic, you made a game that based on Shooting and Building but the Shooting system has failed terrible.

In my opinion, The worst thing on Fortnite  right now, is the terrible BLOOM and not just few small bugs here and there.

First you released Shooting Test 1 which was pretty good and most of the people like it, everyone was start playing Shooting Test 1 because it was x10 better and after few days you removed it without doing any announcement.

I thought (like most of us) that you will bring Shooting Test 2 immediatly after Test 1, but since then no update, no news about what are the plans for shooting system. 

There are thousands and maybe millions of players out there who they don't join Fortnite just because of the terrible Shooting System and terrible BLOOM. And there also millions of current Fortnite players who hate Bloom and the Current shooting model.

I just don't get it. Why you don't do something about it asap, why you don't take it seriously and work on it...Still no update of what happened with Shooting Test 1 and still no update about when the Shooting Test 2 will come out...

Please EPIC, let us know what it's going on and please bring back the Shooting Test 1 until you bring Shooting Test 2 or until you make a perma change on Shooting model.

Bloom It's not Fun at all, reward shots spammers and lucky shots is not fair at all. When your shots are based on luck you can't really imporve your skills.

Sometimes I go crazy when I see a person in front of me, aim right on him and I see my bullets go right &amp; left but zero hit... It doesn't even make sense.

In order to prevent those comments ""you need to aim better"", ""you need to build fast and make a good strategy in order to outplay your enemy"", ""make a more accurance shooting will destroy the game etc...""

I know how to build and I know how to aim (+ when there is no recoil patern and shots are random you can't really learn the weapons). The problem clearly is the bloom. 

And for those who say that a more accurate shooting system will destroy game i have to say this:

With more accurate shooting system, building is a MUST because if you don't build fast in order to protect yourself then you are dead. So a more accurate system will imporve gameplay and will not destroy fortnite, since building will become 100% a MUST thing.

On Shooting Test 1 which also had bloom but also had more accurate shots, I increased my performace like x2-x4 or more.

I'm an active user on official Fortnite Forum, and I see daily posts about bloom and shooting system. People hate bloom and asking for a better shooting system but still no announcement...

So please EPIC do something about it, let us know what is going on. and at least bring back Shooting Test 1 and allowed us to play there instead of the terrible bloom mode.

Adding new bombs, new potions, new funny stuff and new modes, it's ok and cool but I think you miss the most important thing...

You made a shooting game that has a terrible shooting system and you don't even focus on it in order to fix it.

Changing the default shooting system after 1 or even after 2 years from now, it will make things worse. 

(Just my 2 cents)

Thanks",FortNiteBR

In many of the threads that mention Ninja, people tend to say things like ""yeah he gets a lot of kills but doesn't win as much as so and so"" or in regards to some other streamers people will say ""They only win because they go to underpopulated areas and don't engage as much until end game and only get 5 kills"", etc...

The tournaments I've seen so far for Fortnite on Gamebattles and other sites all focus on kills, nothing to do with wins or even placement.

So, what makes a Battle Royale player ""good""? Is it Wins? ... Kills? a balance of both? What makes someone ""good"" to you?

Complaining about changes that suggest the intention of having people spend their V-Bucks to get them to buy more to get season 3

I have purchased season 2 battle pass to make a (small) contribution to Epic Games, as I thought their good practices as a business and as developers were what was long gone in the industry, and so I wanted to support them the way I could. 

Over the past week, however, I can only feel somewhat betrayed by the way things are being handled. The latest changes in Epic's statement regarding the acquisition of season 3 battle pass is nothing but a shady practice. As someone who would have purchase the next battle pass with my own money, I have now changed my mind because of those practices. Surely, if they had told me that I would be able to pay for season 3 with V-bucks, I would have saved them, thus not spending more money, and Epic knew that. So, they decided to make us believe that we 'could' spend our V-Bucks, which is not a good practice. To those saying that Epic is just trying to adapt to what the community is asking for, please be real. I have requested a V-Buck refund in exchange for the removal of my bought emotes/dances as soon as I learned about this, only to be ignored. If Epic did indeed only want to adapt to the community's requests, they would have offered EVERYONE the chance to get their bucks back, seeing that they changed their minds by the end of season 2.

As I strongly believe I am not the only one in this situation, and knowing that Epic (at least used to) read our opinions, I thought I would give it a shot on this subreddit to get their attention. I am discontent. Are you?

I did a quick search and found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7bm4ew/comment/dpj1ocz?st=JDVINTD8&amp;sh=636e8b53) on an old thread, and I’d love to see this implemented with a temp/perma ban system after getting punished so many times. This would make it so in order for the player to even have the chance at being punished, they would have to down the teammate, and then finish them as well. I feel the punish button should do something along the lines of killing the team killer, then reviving the one who was killed, and I feel if a player kills 2 of 3 other squad members, he should be insta killed. This is a very difficult to handle situation, so obviously this idea isn’t fool proof and would need some things to change, but imo the game 100% is missing something with friendly fire off as it just allows players to be reckless and bring rpgs to literally every fight.

[Discussion],"**Please before you downvote**, could we try to discuss this? It seems to be the consensus of this community that rewarding anything from wins is a bad idea. I would like to know why? 

For example, why would it be a bad idea to reward say 10 stars (1 tier) from a win? IMO **getting a WIN is a lot harder to achieve than doing a daily challenge of sitting in a tree for 10 mins to get 5 stars (1/2 tier)?** 

I think it would make more battlepass sales too, since wins would have value and people who don't like mindless grind could achieve top tier with 100 wins at their own pace. 100 wins is also not something easily achievable as i am sure 50% of the playerbase still has less than that in the season about to end. In fact, a lot of people who started in the beginning don't have 100 wins.

What are your thoughts?

As you may know there are 100 tiers to this season so this means we need to earn 1000 stars to reach max tier. 

You can earn 229 stars from going from level 1-100 
22stars from 1-10 
Then 23stars from 10-20, 20-30 etc.
9x23=207
207+22=229

This now brings you down too 771 stars.
If you purchased season two battle pass you already skip 5 tiers which means we now deduct another 50 stars off 771. 

721 stars remaining. 

You can earn up to 70 stars from your daily challenges each week. You also can earn 50stars from your weekly challenges as well. This means we earn 120 stars a week from challenges. 

If you go through 6weeks of doing every challenge on your weeklies and dailies then this eliminates another 720 stars leaving you with 1 star left. 
6weeksx7days is 42 days. Unfortunately as we are left on an uneven number we have to do an extra day for this last star. 

This makes it 43 days to reach level 100 if you want to reach tier 100 in the earliest time possible without buying tiers using any v bucks.

So 43 days from 22nd of February is the Wednesday 4th April. 

**This theory also means I am hoping the weekly challenges start on the release date of the battle pass and every Thursday they open up a new lot of weekly challenges**

I'm one of those loners that doesn't have many virtual friends online and so am often the spare squad member that fills a team.

I'm pretty decent at the game. Nothing to write home about. Its great to have an online game where you don't feel the pressure to be amazing. Even if you're average, you can still have great fun playing.

One thing I've noticed when I'm playing squads is just how many times my downed teammates get lost in the storm or go crawling off after being sniped, looking for aid and cover and slowing the teams ability to save them and fight back.

It got me thinking. How would a system where you could literally carry a fallen teammate fit into the game? 

The logistics of it from a programming point of view are beyond my comprehension, but I was thinking how cool it would be to be able to sacrifice a space in your inventory for that of a team mate. Imagine if you will, you're near the storms eye and you pick up your team mate and sacrifice a rifle in order to save them.

Maybe there would be a case of picking which teammate you would want to save if two of them were down.

Being able to carry them out of a firefight to safety would be heroic and might add a new angle to the game in terms of your ability to retreat.

Also if you're close to top 10 and you have a stacked inventory, you would have to make a snap decision on whether its really worth dumping your rocket launcher for a team mate you've already revived twice.

I learned this the hard way.  I needed 25 levels to unlock the Floss dance which I really wanted.  Figured if I bought the $25 Vbuck package I would have enough to buy the +10 tiers twice to get me most of the way there, then use the remaining Vbucks on my season 3 pass.

After purchasing the required Vbucks, I was dissapointed to find out that you can only buy the booster once.  I really think this needs to be made more clear, as I wouldn't have even bothered buying any tiers, or even the $25 vbuck package, had I know this upfront.

I've sent a support email seeing if Epic will help me out with this.  But at least now the rest of you have been warned :)

Edit: For those of you down voting me...I assume it's because you think I'm complaining?  

But imagine you walk into a store and see an item sitting on a rack that you want two of - but this store takes a special kind of currency.  So you go to your bank and exchange your real dollars for the stores currency, come back to the store, but then the a salesman comes up and stops you from buying the two copies of what you wanted because it's a one time only purchase.

1) Not many people go here, and when they do, you can easily avoid them. I am not saying you should shy away from gunfights, if thats what you want to do. But keep in mind, if you are trying to win the round, every gun fight you are involved in runs a solid chance you might get downed. The less conflict, the greater chances of winning the round.

2) Lots of loot and chests. You have about 6 houses, and ice cream truck that typically has 1-2 boxes, a few sheds, and the massive fort which typically has about 3-4 boxes as well.

3) If you loot East to West, or left to right looking on the map, you end up in Wailing Woods. Since you land here first, you have a solid window to get loot, hit up the woods, and stack up on wood for future builds, all before the storm gets you. (assuming you are not safe)


Edit: Someone said this in the comment, and they are absolutely correct. If the bus comes in right over it, it might not be a good idea. But 9 times out of 10, the bus comes in at an angle that makes sense to land here.

I tested it and finally, for the first time in 4 days, I was able to get into the top 25 without any lag and audio delay. Repeated this 3 times; all with the same relieving result.



Here's the fix for Windows PCs (providing that your computer has sufficient specs to run Fortnite before the recent update):



[Picture guide](https://imgur.com/a/qSgkd)



* Open Fortnite
* Open task manager (crtl + alt + delete and pick Task Manager)
* Right click 'Fortnite' in your task manager
* Click 'Go to details'
* Right click the highlighted process
* Hover your mouse over 'Set priority' and pick either 'High' or 'Realtime' then click 'Change priority'

A skin in a video game should never cost more than $9.99 and that's even kind of alot for just changing your character's appearance. I understand the game is free but that is kind of canceled out by how much money they make, if an entire squad wants that new cool looking skin it costs $80 all together.


I would make it like this

Legendary Skin - $9.99

Rare- $4.99

Common - $1.99


Considering this game has no possible way at all to earn VBucks without buying STW for $60 or no way to change your character's appearance other than spending money on customization which people tend to care alot about, the skins should not cost this much.

And as the circle gets smaller and smaller the tile distance decreases to more so 10 tiles. I think it would be a great tool to use to get out of the storm if you’re too far out. And of course to confuse enemies or to get out of a struggle. Idk if it could be practical or not, I’m sure it would be practical if you make sure the tile distances are logical. ",FortNiteBR

I’ve only been playing for 2 days but I’ve already noticed a number of occasions in which I seemingly should have hit an enemy when shooting at them with an AR, only to miss every single bullet. I’m not talking full clips, more like 5-10 bullets, since by then they’re spamming walls. 

I’m playing on PS4 (which also means accuracy isn’t optimal ofc), and every time I record the footage and watch it back. Sure enough, the dot of my reticle is always on their body as the gun fires at at least one point. 

This has happened at distances ranging from, I’d estimate, 20-50 metres. It’s often when the enemy is running sideways-on, which is generally the hardest time to hit them. 

Both the Purple/Gold ARs and the Grey/Green/Blue ones have been the problem. It always happens when I’m aimed in with L2, not just hip-firing. I’ve not had it with any other gun, even the SMGs always land their shots at 30m, and the shotguns don’t miss when I’m jumping. 

I have had 3 weird instances in which my sniper scope was seemingly on the enemy when I fired, only for it to miss by a whisker. But I chalk that up to slight movement on their behalf as I fire, since the snipers are projectile and the ARs are hitscan. 

TLDR: So I’m just wondering how good/bad the AR spread is (on every AR)? Is this problem common? ",FortNiteBR

I dropped in on an otherwise lackluster location, only to find another player visited shortly before. No weapons to be found, and all in all bad luck for my game. However, I hear dancing! Behind me, the other player is sparing my life and letting me go without killing me—a gesture I truly appreciate.

So, I get going... but not before he fires a shot next to me. I turn back around and see him drop the gun and begin dancing again. Ah! I got it! He wants to team! So, with that, the two of us set out on an emotional and narratively disconnected adventure, shooting those who defy us, defending each other, etc etc.

Unfortunately, he was brutally murdered, but I was able to avenge his death. However, I did eventually die that round.

All of this is to show how I feel about teaming in Solo mode. I feel like if you end up finding some random person who wants to team up—go for it. If part of the game is surviving, how is this not technically a way to survive and beat the odds? You are using your resources, in a sense.

Now, I can understand how talking to someone over PSN, discord, etc and trying to get into the same match is a jerk move. You know the other player, you have time to plan, and you can talk with each other at any moment. That gives you an extremely unfair advantage.

All in all, I want to hear all of your thoughts on my mindset. There may be something I am missing or wrong about, so just let me know.

**TL;DR:** I think teaming in Solo is a strategic move and can be very fun, just so long as you didn’t plan on with someone else prior to the match.

EDIT: Okay I think I have a better understanding of the situation now. However, it would be interesting to get some kind of LTM or full game mode where you can “recruit” players into a squad.",FortNiteBR

1.  Give it a 3 story tall smoke stack to alert nearby players and make setting it down an interesting decision.  Placing it in a spot thats out of sight would be fun.  Interesting decisions are a good thing.

2.  Increase the duration to 75 seconds.  25 seconds is way too short for enemy players to see --&gt; kill campfire players --&gt; run to ---&gt; jump in and heal up.  It's simply not up long enough to dynamically change the battlefield.   That's a missed opportunity. 

3.  If it's up for 75 seconds, Epic has to drop the heal rate from 2hp/sec to 3hp/2 seconds.

Epic, let's get on this.  Making the campfire an interesting little king of the hill beacon would be so much better than what it currently is.

please help me to make EPIC GAMES notice this bug:


PROOF:
https://youtu.be/pUlzoEWBt7k


'bad_module_info has stopped working' - error messages pops every time I try to start the game (PC platform). You can't minimize the error message, if you press 'Cancel' Fortnite will shut down. The game works perfectly but every time I click the messages that is always on top I leave the game (can't shoot, etc...)


LOTS of people got this bug for MONTH now - we posted it everywhere but EPIC GAMES ignores us. PLEASE help us / upvote / comment.


I tried about 10 different methods to fix it (you find lots of fixes in the www) but non work PERMANENTLY.


THANK YOU!


EDIT:
Windows 10, OS &amp; graphic drivers up-to-date.
Most people got AMD cards that got this error.

However, I was wrong. This would cause more problems than it would solve.

Instead, I ask you, fellow Fortnite players... to try. Just try. When you feel outmatched, when you feel all is lost... don't take the cowards way out and drag someone down with you. Try to come out on top. You have a chance. It may be slim but... as Michael Scott once wrote on a whiteboard: ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""

Next time your team is down, turn that hatred into motivation. Don't just kill one and go down with him. Kill them all. You can do it. I believe in you.

It'd be nice if there were an increased delay so we can more easily prevent scumbags from doing their thing. 

Maybe take off this delay if they're super far away from teammates and have no chance of being revived anyway. That way if you find a lone straggler you can still take care of them quickly and move on. ",FortNiteBR

I tried a few games with it in squads, got good at it, killed some people, but I just went back to good old reliable one pump. 

Problem number one.  My problem with people saying Tacticals are gonna be the new meta or pumps are trash now is that they have become so reliant on double pumping that they’ve forgotten that the pump shotgun is a good weapon!  It has insane range, it can one-shot, Jesus it can headshot for over 40 damage at AR range!

So that’s that problem solved for me, the pump won’t just disappear and become trash because it’s still a very good weapon, I like one pump better than one tac.  Problem number 2 for me. Double pump wasn’t some amazingly skilled brain puzzling tactic to destroy your enemies with your pure skill and prowess.  By definition it is an exploit.  You are exploiting an unintended feature in the game by bypassing a purposefully put cool down on a gun.  It’s not too hard to learn, 5-6 games and you’ve pretty much got it down.  Simply the skill-to-reward ratio was much too heavy on the reward and light on the reward.  

Problem number 3, the other defense for double pump is a complete 180 from the other defense, where people are now saying that double pump is something everyone can do and therefore is fair.  While yes everyone can use this, it hurts the game if it becomes too widespread.  There’s no variety, the game becomes stale, people complain about double pump because all they’re getting killed by is double pump, and it gets nerfed to oblivion.  Anyone who played Destiny remembers this is exactly what happened with Thorn and it got nerfed to the ground.  If a something is overpowered it should be nerfed, or things should be brought to its level.  Think of it this way, why doesn’t Epic add a grenade where if you throw it it kills everyone in a 400 meter radius? Everyone can get it so it’s fair.  Except it’s not because it’s overpowered. 

Finally, I think that double pump getting nerfed is a good thing, it forces more variety and players who have grown reliant on double pump to branch out and actually play the game.  But this is all just my opinion.

Sorry for the text walls and probably a lot of spelling and grammar errors.

Tl;dr: Pump is still good, you didn’t have to be some god to use double pump, just because everyone has access to something doesn’t mean it’s fair, double pump nerf forces variety and makes people who rely on double pump to branch out.",FortNiteBR

Thank you! Your input helps shape the future of Battle Royale and we greatly appreciate your comments and concerns.

The Pump Shotgun’s high damage is balanced by its long reload time, and bypassing that weakness makes the weapon stronger than intended.

So, with the upcoming release of 3.0.0, we are making an adjustment to the Pump Shotgun behavior. If you fire the Pump Shotgun and quickly switch weapons, the next time it’s selected it will be forced to pump before firing again. This feature will only be enabled for Pump Shotguns, but we will closely monitor other weapon types for similar concerns.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing you in Season 3!",FortNiteBR

We, as a community, should use our voice to address and help them fix a few things. I am quite sure that Epic is working 24/7 on the game experience though, but together we can help speed things up.

Since I mainly know about console problems, I would appreciate any help for PC errors/bugs. Please feel free to add whatever comes to your mind so we can help Epic make a nonvioilent game for my neighbours and help them getting a better sleep at 2 am in the morning without raging noise!

1. Bug where you cannot build after throwing grenades
2. Console edit button

&amp;#x200B;

Ranked Mode- 

All changed only apply to ranked mode 

In ranked mode kills grant more points towards your rank than placement.

Winning grants a huge boost in points.

Very light matchmaking system where bad players will still run into the top players, but new players / very bad players not be able to run into the top players. 

But what about smurfing? A new account that gets high kills and wins will be taken out of the noob level immediately.

Fresh accounts are monitored more heavily.

The answer is probably yes but I feel like it is just a place for mobile *content* minus any type of support.

I see everyone talking about (myself included) the bugs and glitches of mobile, general concerns, and quality of the support there. Most of it not good. Why can't we get answers like to questions like: ""Why haven't people gotten invites even after nearly a month after signing up"", ""Why are some listed devices STILL not compatable"", ""Why is a *EXAMPLE* device not compatable"", I don't know why you'd list a device as an example of ones that work if IT doesn't work.

In my opinion I found it better when the two subs were shared as people on mobile would get things seen.

If you play this game for the first time, you're going to be put in 50's. That's just how it works. That also means that 50's is pretty much stacked with bad players.

Let me tell you a scenario that we absolutely HATE. 

Tilted is on the other side, we decide to drop either tilted or shifty and drop like 10-15 kills at the beginning. We then rotate to the storm, just to realize that it's 40v27 in our favor. Obviously we are pissed because that means less kills for us. Suddenly we spot like 5 Jonesys in their natural habitats We start pushing them and suddenly we see 10 Drift mates behind us trying to steal our kills. 3 Drifts die because they were shot down. All Jonesys are dead by now and it's a 35v9. 

*trigger warning*

 I am a mom of two kids who love Fortnite! I recently learned how to play and now realize why they love it so much, this game is awesome!

 Anyway, sometimes I play their account when they're in school and today, while playing, I played squads with this super cute little kid with an adorable accent. He serenaded the whole squad the whole time we are playing, it was so cute. He mentions that he will be posting this on his vlog and I'm thinking how adorable. When he and I are the only squad members left alive, he tells me that his uncle works for epic and he has contacted ""Ninja"" who will be adding my sons account to his friends list and now I will get to play with Ninja on Monday at such and such time.

Ummm... All I can think is, if this is legit, and I am the one who gets my kids to play a game with Ninja, I am going to be the coolest freaking mom on the planet! This could earn me some serious Mom points!

Does this ever happen? Or is this kid probably pulling my chain and breaking my heart?

Not many. It isn't worth the pick up. That is why I think you should be able to use 3 minis to give you 50 extra shield. I'll explain. 2 minis give you 50 health but can't be used after you take 2 minis. What if after taking 2 minis, you could take 3 minis at one time to give you 50 shield to get you to 100 shield. This would, in an ideal world, take 7.0 seconds. I imagine it as being a last second resort to using those extra minis in your inventory slot. This would also balance the RNG a little bit, as minis are less rare than Big Shields. If you found 6 minis, you would be able to use 2 to get 50 shield like normal and then be able to use 3 of those extra shields to get to 100 shield even after taking 2 mini shields. When you have less than 50 shield, you won't be able to take 3 shields at once. Once you hit 50 though, you would be able to use 3 minis to get to 100 shield. This would still make it better to find big shields because you wouldn't have to use more minis. This would also keep the Rarity of mini shields fair. I just don't like having 500 shield worth of shield in my inventory and only being able to use 50 at a time.

Lately i haven't gotten a solo win and it's not because i'm bad, i get about 7-12 kills every ""good"" game and what's annoying is that the game is made to bad players.

I hate how i get an avarge of about 10 kills and it's a 1 vs 1 and i killed almost everyone and the last player is always so bad and have shoot at me all game when i was fighting others. For some reason shield is so rare so if you going try hard you won't see a shield in the hole game. and this new circel thing is so bad to becasue when you are going to the circel you see a 5 stories high tower were the last player is and he just spammes at you and you can't do anything cause he has 12 rockets to his granate lancher, who bad players always use. And they just spam with everything they got.

 I miss how the seasons were in season 2 or 3 when the game wasen't broken. it whould be ok if they realesed a new gamemode were there was no explosives because they ARE SO BROKEN. 

For exempel the game before i'm writing this i got 9 kills and landed tilted, killed everybody. When i was fighting someone else btw had 75 health, it was so hard because he just keep on shooting me with a scar, it was like i was playing duos. when i finnally killed that guy i had 2 hp and started healing and the storm were exactly were this guy had built a 5 stroies tower and i had to push btw still had no shield. I started pushing him and i hear a granate lancher spam granetes and i coulden't even see what i was doing because i just saw explosions everywere. i survived that and then he started spamming with a scar non stop i tried to the like edit out and then doubbel ramp to get to a better position. It didn't go well and when i was in a better possition i had 30 hp and was about to heal when he just non-stop start spamming me again, this time with a minigun. i coulden't do anything and when i ran out of mats i was dead. He had 2 kills after he killed me. ofcourse it was some ugly skin dancing ""take the L"" on me. btw i did jUsT BuIlD lol non stop but was out of materials

I hope in season 6 Epic will fix things in this broken game. Cause i just rage at this game constantly.

I just wan't to get a another win. I feel like i people who camps in a 1 by 1 all game and doesn't kill anyone, always win.",FortNiteBR

This is a huge problem because it‚Äôs not accurate at all and I constantly find myself switching to the wrong weapon or my harvesting tool during especially intense fights. 
From what I‚Äôve seen it looks like as of right now the most commonly used setup is binding harvest tool to 1 and weapons to 234xz. 
Well I‚Äôve been trying to practice that and I can‚Äôt seem to get around the fact that I have to lift my middle finger off of W to switch to weapons in the 2 and 3 slot, meaning that I have to stop moving forward to switch to those weapons, which can‚Äôt be right because I see streamers switch to all of their weapons without any effect on their movement. 
My other issue is with the toggle harvest tool binding. I got used to using x and it worked fine, but now my harvest tool is technically bound to 1, which sucks, so I made the toggle binding Tab. If 1 is really what skilled players are using though I‚Äôll just practice and get used to it.

I‚Äôd really appreciate anyone who‚Äôs willing to read all this and give me a few bits of advice or insight into what most people are doing or if I‚Äôm doing anything obviously wrong.

Here‚Äôs all my key bindings in case it helps:

Movement: WASD
Use: E
Wall: F
Ramp: mouse side button
Floor: other mouse side button 
Roof: V
Sprint: shift
Crouch: C
Toggle Harvest Tool: Tab
1: Harvest tool
234XZ: weapons 
Q: exit build mode 
R: reload 
G: edit building
T: trap
Alt: cursor mode (hold for inventory)


I also feel like I‚Äôm wasting Q because I should be pressing a weapon binding to exit build mode but I‚Äôm not sure what I would replace it with.

‚Ä¢Easy to farm materials

To stop sky bases:

So I was thinking about this part for a while, is their anyway to stop skybases in this mode, it took me a while but I‚Äôve thought of it!

‚Ä¢Add the heavy sniper into the game that does 0 damage to players, and only damages player-built structures
‚Ä¢You could carry it to eliminate anyone attempting to skybase
‚Ä¢You cannot be damaged by it so it is still technically shotguns only

Possible Other Features:

‚Ä¢The jetpack could potentially stay, but this means players can survive from falling off a skybase
‚Ä¢Heavy Shotgun could spawn as floor loot too

But now it's Solid Gold and it's utter trash. Here's why:

1. **Soaring 50v50s was the most balanced of the 50v50 format**, simply due to the fact that the greater mobility allowed for all players to be more spread out along the map (and collect loot) without spending too much time reaching the circle or worrying about not getting the best loot. Often the team whose bus starts closer to the circle had the upper hand but this was minimized by the ability to quickly traverse from one end of the map to the other. Truly lopsided matches were a rarer occurrence and teammates weren't able to shoot down your ramps to knock you.
2. **Solid Gold and its chance for certain weapon drops hurts close quarter combat with its low shotgun spawn rate**. In the couple games I've played, I've found only one heavy shotgun, compared to at least five heavy snipers. This weapon spawn rate ends up shifting the meta of the match to camping and sniping, which favours the team that spawns closer to the circle. I understand that Solid Gold is supposed to level the playing field by restricting what weapons all players may find but it restricts a playstyle that allows for a faster paced game. In every game of solid gold, when I approach the circle I am immediately sniped at by multiple enemy snipers and/or spammed by SCARs. I don't even remember getting anywhere close to an enemy in the entirety of the matches I've played. 
3. This one is more subjective I guess but the selection of weapons isn't that great. All you ever get is silenced pistols and deagles and maybe a SCAR here and there. No smgs to speak of since the P90 never spawns. 
4. Again just my opinion but it's not relaxing or fun playing Solid Gold compared to Soaring 50v50s. I was comfortable using a variety of weapons that you would normally find, and I would often get at least 5 kills each game. In Solid Gold, however, I struggle to knock anyone due to having to constantly build cover to hide from snipers. And peaking is not what it used to be. 

Rant's over, just upset that Soaring 50v50s is gone, but I know it'll come back eventually. ",FortNiteBR

it could be one of three reasons 

&amp;#x200B;

\#1

I have not touch fortnite for about 2 days as my computer was facing some bsod error that i was unable to resolve. 

Due to the bsod , i had to factory reset my pc twice . every time after i factory reset , i reinstalled epicgames immediately but i didn't install fortnite  .

&amp;#x200B;

\#2

i used my debit card to help my friends to buy v bucks. so my debit card is being used for multiple account 

&amp;#x200B;

\#3

on 20 august , i tried to purchase $25 v bucks using a virtual visa called entropay . i had more then enough money in my account but the purchase didn't go through. ($50)  it got rejected so i tried a few more times . i tried around 3-4 times

i have seen some reddit user getting ban from getting their card rejected . 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i have requested support but they told me 

https://i.redd.it/5oucg28dz8j11.png

&amp;#x200B;

i have spend over $200 on fortnite . i really want my account back . 

They sent refund receipt saying that they are gonna refund me the money but it was only a total of $120 .

&amp;#x200B;

i have contacted magyst by reddit message. no reply yet 

im at the end of my wits . really hope someone can help me

Demo phones are prone to reset themselves daily, allowing someone to claim the skin and than another person claim the skin the next day if the phone reset itself.
Samsung/Epic can **easily** determine if a phone has given out the Galaxy skin to multiple accounts and could simply be removing the skin from accounts who've received the skin from a phone that's given out the skin more than once. 
This seems like the most logical reason IMO.

As to people who have claimed that they had their Galaxy skin removed and they purchased either the Note 9 or the Tab S4; sorry but I can't take your word for it.
I can say I have Big Foot in my basement and argue I'm telling the truth but ultimately that means nothing.

If you did actually purchase either devices and the skin was removed (which potentially is possible), contacting Epic with genuine proof of ownership should result in them giving you back your skin.

This is just a theory and could be proven wrong if Epic games is to make a statement regarding the issue. ",FortNiteBR

I live in Hawaii, I have quite good internet, however I still can only average around 70-80ms, have never gone under 60ms ... probably because the nearest server is 2.5k miles away. Season 4 I averaged around a 6 k/d, yet this season I am struggling to keep a 2k/d. At first I thought I was just failing to adapt to the meta inexplicably, but after a while I started to notice a huge disparity in what happens when I spam my enemies walls and when they spam my walls. 

And I wouldn‚Äôt just blame ping if I didn‚Äôt have good reason. I just got back from a trip to California where I was able to play at less than 30ms, and it was a completely different game. I can‚Äôt stress enough the massive difference in how the game felt, everything was so much more consistent, my buildings placed about twice as fast, and editing actually felt instant. (most of the time... editing has always been janky) it even felt like my shots registered more often too, but that could have been a placebo. in fact, I was the one phasing through my enemies buildings for once. It was day and night, If i used turbo build to replace a wall being spammed, only 1 or 2 bullets would go through, as opposed to on my normal ping where, if I don‚Äôt double up with a ramp, an enemy can basically shoot me through the wall as if it weren‚Äôt there.

Now ‚Äì obviously better ping is going to be an advantage, but the problem is just how drastic of an advantage it is right now. 70 Ping is not extremely high, I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs not much higher than average ping. But due to the building nerf and drum gun meta my 70ms ping is the root to hundreds of deaths. 

What am I supposed to do?? I don‚Äôt know what can really be done about this but it‚Äôs very frustrating, considering that there‚Äôs really nothing I can do to improve my ping and yet my only moderately high ping has been such a major detriment to my playing experience. ",FortNiteBR

Sup guys, 

As many people know, there's has been a rumor going on that epic will further investigate with the store-claim epidemic and will probably ban people / remove the skin by tracking down imei numbers that are unique to every phone. In this case it's all about the demo-phones that can be accessible really easily.

I really hope this is the case because the fortnite community have really destroyed the rarity of the skin, its baffling that older people are doing this aswell, just get the phone if you like the skin.

But I'm really sick of just how easy the challenges are every week. It is clear they are just trying to cater for the worst of players so they don't feel helpless and like they can't progress, which I understand... But how about having tiers of challenges? Yes, I know they sort of do that with the ""(hard)"" challenges but lets be real they are often the easier ones for that week.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it really upset people if there were some challenges that seemed out of their reach to complete or would it more likely make them strive even harder to improve and complete it?

&amp;#x200B;

Easy challenges: Stuff like open chests at a certain location, finish in the top 10 *x* amount of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Medium: I imagine these to be more like the majority of the current challenges, get kills in named location, find a llama, follow treasure map etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Hard: This is the part I'd like to actually matter, how about things like ""get 5 kills in a single game"" (a lot of you will laugh at how 'hard' that is but seriously the majority of the player base would **REALLY** struggle with that). Deal 2,000 damage to players in the single game. Get 3 kills in the space of a minute. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know really, just kind of winging this post, but my point is that I know for a fact players would **LOVE** more variation on the difficulty of challenges. Just look at how mental it gets on Thursdays when the new challenges drop... and then by Friday everyone has done them all. ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the majority of players were complaining about deadzones, I understand that the majority of feedback for this change on reddit was positive, I understand that I should be able to learn and adapt to the new system, but the fact that I am being forced to do this is ridiculous.

I have played this game since October 2017, almost a day 1 player. I had the perfect sensitivity for me, it fit like a glove and I've used it for a whole year. I loved it and now its gone and no matter what I do in settings, I cant get it back.

I distinctly remember a post from EPIC last time they messed around with sensitivity, stating that they were sorry because they understand how important sensitivity settings are and that they would not mess with this again.

In this case, lots of people wanted it, but at the very least it should have been an option and now the game is basically ruined for me. My AR shots are all over the place now, I cant do flick shots with a shotgun anymore, I cant use a sniper anywhere near as well. Its just made me not want to play the game, and it was my favorite game prior to this patch and has been since October.

Many of you will say 'Just adapt, its better', but I simply don't want to, nor do I have the time nor energy nor patience to adapt after already having played this game for 1 year on the same sensitivity. I'm not a pro player, I work full time, I just want to be able to finish work and play the game I love without being unbelievably frustrated every time I get into a fight. I have spent hundreds of pounds on this game, and never complained before, but I feel this is a fair reason for complaint.

Is anyone else feeling the same as me?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - EPIC, if you are reading, please PLEASE give us an option to bring back the old controller deadzones for those who want it. My sensitivity settings were something I loved, and currently I just don't want to play the game. I spent a whole year getting used to the sensitivity, committing it to muscle memory because you yourselves promised it would not change again, and you took it away without the option to bring it back. It SO frustrating for someone like me.",FortNiteBR

But it's also one of the most fascinating, because we have no idea what it was, until now.

Thanks to u/PuckReflix for figuring this out, but the runes that the cube have been leaving behind all are outlines of buildings in Tilted. Now, who's the one guy who has seemed to have a vendetta against Tilted since he showed up? Visitor. 

When season 5 started, this character disappeared, literally. He was shot into the rift, and we never saw him again. But where did the cube come from? The rift, with pink lightning. Very recently, the cube started to emit an anti gravity forcefield. Who had an obsession with hop rocks, the anti gravity rocks? Visitor, as he used them on the Rocket. 

Here's my TL;DR. Visitor is back in the cube, and now that he can control it, he's heading to the one place he's been wanting to destroy this whole time, Tilted. He's going to tilted to try and destroy it. How? With the anti gravity forcefield. It's possible he'll try and slam it down, completely obliterating it.



Or it's not that at all and I'm reading to deep into it. Still though, way too many coincidences to say Visitor isn't related in some way. ",FortNiteBR

However, 2 weeks ago things were starting to click for me and I thought I was on the verge of becoming a decent player. My nightly K/Ds were closer to 2.0, I was getting in great build battles and winning, I was playing smart and consistently making it to the top 5 with 4-5 kills.  Nothing ground breaking, but for me super enjoyable.

Fast forward to this week, and I‚Äôm now playing worse than I have since season 1. K/D this week has been less than 0.7, and every night will go through long stretches with 5-6 games without a kill or a 15 game stretch with 2-3 kills.

Have they introduced some kind of SBMM that thinks because I‚Äôve played a lot of games, I‚Äôm supposed to be in the sweaty lobbies? It just seems everyone I run into steamrolls me, and it is making this game
I love a lot less fun.

I'm on ps4 and never has there been so much lag, skipping, shots not registering, and just random bs that prevents reactions and causes death or heartache or both.

I don't have the best internet, I'll admit that. But since season 3 (or the next season after builder pro was released) the state of the game itself has seemed to go downhill. I don't mean the meta. I can adjust for that. I literally mean the game and how it feels.

Then they go and mess with controller sensitivities and now my ads just feels awful... Maybe that's just me, but it's the next to last straw before I quit for a while to see if things get better. 

I LOVE this game, I just want to see it taken care of properly. EPIC, I really hope you have a plan to make your game more stable. It could be perfect.

I have a good antivirus software and if it didn‚Äôt like it it would of have removed it. I never altered with the game files so I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Season 3- The Enforcers are taking over every dimension they find. They find the Visitors Dimension. The Visitors are scrambling to find a new dimension for in a panic. They use a resource from their world called Hop Rocks to jump dimensions. They send explorers out to find a new suitable dimension using these Hop Rocks. One hops dimensions right into a comet headed for the Fortnite Island. 

Season 4- Once it lands the Visitor finds this dimension free of any Enforcer presence and decides to go back to his dimension to tell his race. It gets all the Hop Rocks that were left around the island by his dimension hopping to the rocket the Visitor found (evident throughout the season by the traveling caravans of Hop Rocks) and uses the Hop Rocks to power this rocket he found and dimension hops back through to his dimension. He uses what I call ‚ÄúUnstabilized‚Äù Hop Rocks or the blue Hop Rocks to get back to his world. They are ‚ÄúUnstabilized‚Äù after the impact to the Island. Using these ‚ÄúUnstabilized‚Äù Hop Rocks leaves a rift in the sky that starts making random objects disappear. He wanted the rift to remain though because he wanted to send something back through it.

Season 5- He and his race decide to send the cube through the rift and close the rift right after since it was no longer useful. The cube is made of ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù Hop Rocks or purple Hop Rocks. The cube will not make random objects disappear. 

Season 6- What it will do is by using ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù Hop Rocks is make a ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù Rift. This Rift will send a futuristic dimensional city through it that will have the low gravity field around it. The low gravity field was made by ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù Hop Rocks. This city will be used by the Visitor Race to settle this world to get away from the Enforcers. But as we see the Enforcers have traveled here already. So maybe a war between Visitors and Enforcers will happen on the Fortnite Island.

Other Notes- 
Bounce Pads use Stabilized Hop Rocks because they glow purple when you use them and are safe to use. 

The rocket used Unstabilized Hop Rocks because it left behind a dangerous blue rift that would teleport random things away. 

The Impulse grenades use Unstabilized Hop Rocks because they are dangerous to use and are blue. 

The rift became purple once the cube was on its way since the cube was made from Stabilized Hop Rocks. 

The shockwave grenades use Stabilized Hop Rocks since they are safe and are purple. 

The Stabilized and Unstabilized Hop Rocks aren‚Äôt entirely necessary to the theory but do provide some extra details.

i'm going to get an ATK and go around the map and see if there's any other hills ,

for anyone who doesn't still know, by datamining files we found that the cube will travel 7 times and put 7 runes on the map, after that, it will go to ""Lake"" which is the name of loot lake in coding (found in files, i also found that tilted is called ""city"")  i also found these [7 rocks above lonely lodge](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/483351730373918730/484477006055079946/unknown.png)  with a big rock above them and [7 trees next to risky](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/483351730373918730/484479537745362970/7semicirlcetrees.png) and a big tree above them, so what that means? since the first rune is on fatal, then it's going to the left of the map, i think all runes will be on the left each on on each hill, then the cube will sit on the lake and activate , every rune will have either low gravity or each one have it's own ability .

The rules are now far less strict overall, but we still have a minimum requirements. The bar has been lowered and will be monitored. We allow more memes, fluff and posts overall now. We believed we had a history of over-policing the content rather than allowing the voting system and general quality guidelines to speak for themselves.

----

What's up guys! We just wanted to reach out to the community despite all of the hype for the cube to update you guys on what we are doing for the subreddit and how we are bettering our rules for all of you and for the future. Everything we do is for you, and we love you all very much! &lt;3

We have noticed a lot of community dissatisfaction with our ruleset and our removals, increasingly so since our last revision. The team took a few days to review each rule in detail, deciding the best course of action for a community gaming forum. We've ultimately decided to change the rules significantly. This doesn't mean that we will be allowing template memes, but it does mean we will be allowing more humor posts, more fluff posts, and generally more posts overall. We still want to allow, encourage, and foster Fortnite meta and in-depth game discussions here. This is the general ""forum"" for Fortnite: Battle Royale and we want all content to have a chance here. As Reddit moderators, our job isn‚Äôt to curate the content but rather keep everything in line. Content bans should be applied retroactively instead of proactively, and after we've noticed that some content is more easily digested (viewed/upvoted) than other content.

Additionally, the goal of all these rules is to make them easier to enforce as a team. Previously our rules were a bit too dependent on the moderator assessing the post at the time, and we apologize for that. We realize we had a lot of faults with our past enforcement and ruleset, and want to begin making good on that by making our own rules easier for everyone to agree on if a post should or should not be allowed. Obviously, we're all human and mistakes will be made, but we'll do our best to correct those as a team.

Below we‚Äôll outline the rule and policy changes as well as the reasoning:

### Post Quality Fortnite Content

##Changes

- Our ‚Äúno match results screenshots‚Äù rule has been changed into one that allows match result videos instead. We find no benefit out of the same generic screenshot being repeatedly posted but video capture allows us to witness potentially interesting game endings.

- We have removed our restriction on nostalgia posts as there seems to be little reason to enforce this rule. This seems like more policing of content than moderation of the subreddit which results in excessive amounts of workload for no gain to the community.

- We have merged the ‚Äúno petitions‚Äù rule into this rule as there was very little need for it to be a standalone policy. We do not receive many inquiries for this type of content.

- We have removed the ‚Äúshort jokes are not allowed‚Äù restriction because we find little benefit in policing the content based on the length of the humor beyond what we have already determined to be an appropriate body length as a team for submissions in AutoModerator.

- Our complete ‚Äúno phone photos/videos‚Äù rule has been changed to allow phone photos/video when the situation is reasonable, such as when there is no other possible way to reasonably capture the situation. We believe that the other rules will cover this when it is an issue but overall want to be more lenient, allowing posts of things such as a clock tower that looks similar to the clock tower in Tilted Towers.

- We have changed our ‚Äúno stolen content‚Äù rule into a new stance that allows reposts of others‚Äô content as long as the original creator receives proper credit in either the title or the comments.

##Reasoning

The general thoughts behind the changes here are that we flat out removed too much for low quality. We want to allow shorter jokes, nostalgia posts, and fluff posts that show off the best the community has to bring. We will be enforcing the quality aspect of this less, where as only posts that are blatantly low quality (phone pictures, stick figures, Drake memes) will be removed.

### Title Guidelines

## Changes

- We removed the policy ‚ÄúMaking a post where the title is the only thing related to Fortnite is not allowed‚Äù because we want to be slightly more lenient on allowing things that aren't directly Fortnite related but bring a point to discuss.

- Previously our rule about clickbait titles was present in both ‚ÄúPost Quality Fortnite Content‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúTitle Guidelines‚Äù under different wording. As such, one was removed for being a duplicate. It is no longer present under ‚ÄúPost Quality Fortnite Guidelines.""

- We moved ‚ÄúPosts of clickbait social media titles are not allowed‚Äù from ‚ÄúPost Quality Fortnite‚Äù to ‚ÄúTitle Guidelines‚Äù because this rule set is a more appropriate place for a title-based rule to be located.

- We removed the policy ‚ÄúWhen posting links from Twitter, post titles should be as accurate to the source as possible.‚Äù because this type of policy is typically geared towards more professional sports communities due to the professionalism involved and isn‚Äôt necessary in our community. Overall, this policy felt extremely unnecessary and was rarely ever enforced, if ever.

## Reasoning

In addition to what we wrote above, we want to allow things that are tangentially related to Fortnite that are also opening up room for discussion. We will also be allowing posts from one user to another, so if someone makes a large scale castle and another person wants to say ""I just had to one up the castle"" by building a more elaborate castle, they may do so. The main reason for this rule will now be that Title Guidelines will mostly require titles for posts to have context and not be clickbait.

###Humor Guidelines

##Changes

- We removed the rule ‚ÄúThis means copy and pasting assets from Fortnite onto something non-game related is not allowed."" This means copy and pasted Fortnite assets on top of non Fortnite assets are now allowed on the subreddit, granted that they follow the other rules. Because this rule is essentially rededuant with our template meme policy, there is nothing wrong with users adding Fortnite content to something non-game related and that does not determine the quality of a post. This used to be something we'd remove, and would be a controversial topic to discuss. Now, we will let the subreddit filter it out naturally by upvoting/downvoting said posts. This will allow us to ""moderate"" more in terms of actual subreddit issues, and not posts like these.

- Removed ‚ÄúShort jokes, puns, or similar posts are not allowed. Longer, humorous content and relevant satire are allowed.‚Äù As long as the user is abiding by our content length guidelines, there is no reason to enforce this rule.

##Reasoning

Humor should be allowed if there is something unique brought to the table. We want to allow shorter humorous content while also removing the ""low effort"" memes that you see so often. This means if a meme is done in a popular format that is not special to Fortnite in any way like a Drake meme, Despicable Me, or any other commonly found template meme then we will be removing it. However, these were probably 1-3% of removals, and we will be approving humor content more often now.

###No Witch Hunting or Posting Personal Information

##Changes

- We have condensed the rule down to say in simpler terms that no matter the circumstances, to not post any personal information about a person, organization, entity, etc. The overall rule is still the same, but is now in an easier-to-read format while still staying true to its original intention.

### Frequently Posted Topics

## Changes

- This rule should essentially only be used to address reposts and new topics now.

- The first bullet point previously explained what the first paragraph did. Most of what changed about this rule is the bulk of the paragraph being removed due to its insane redundancy. The fat is cut and gone. This rule is enforced the same way. We don‚Äôt want thirty posts saying the same thing, but we don‚Äôt need thirty sentences to explain that one thing.

###Promotion Guidelines

##Changes
- 10:1 guidelines are now applicable across Reddit. This was agreed on in our monthly meeting. If 10% of a user‚Äôs posts on Reddit are their own submissions or are comments on their own submissions, then they are in violation of our promotion guidelines.

###Posts Must Provide a Point For Discussion

##Changes
- We now allow posts in reply to another post. We found that we were removing posts communicating between others for no reason. Posts that spam the same content would get removed regardless of if it was in reply. This rule had effectively killed the types of meta memes that other subreddits have and are enjoyed in their communities. This allows for unique interactions that make the subreddit more human.

- LFG is still not allowed. However, we will be more diligent in re-directing.

- The majority of removals regarding this post were on posts with hundreds, if not thousands of comments a day. There is no reason to be removing posts for not encouraging discussion when there are literally hundreds of comments on that post.

##Reasoning

As said above and in another breakdown of the reasonings, we now allow posts in reply to another post. We found that we were removing posts communicating between others for no reason. This policy will receive a heavy enforcement change, since we found ourselves too often removing posts for not encouraging discussion based on the sub-points of this rule rather than the actual main context of the rule. All posts should bring up something to discuss, but not to the point that it's college level debate required.

He answered with a no, and continued saying that he'd rather have one broken pump than the double doo doo pumps. I feel that he is right, the majority of the community loved the double pump, but the pump and tac meta was better. Not only was it more versatile, but it wasn't ""OP"". And no, I am not saying to go back to having the broken pump do 200+ damage, just simply go back to the double shotguns, but this is where they should change it to where you can not use the same shotguns, ex: 2 pumps or 2 double barrels. I know it may be confusing to add this but they have done something like this with the pump, where we were forced to use a different shotgun. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Remove the delay in switching shotguns, not only will it make it more enjoyable to play, but more versatile, as EPIC loves to say it.

With  a recent patch EPISCAM GAMES made a huge change to the Whiteout skin  without consulting anybody who paid for it. They added a neck to the  skin and called it a """"bugfix"""".

This is  hugely unfair to the people that bought this skin before the """"change"""".  The only reason myself and many, \*\*many\*\*, many, \*many\*, #many others  bought this skin is because of the floating head aesthetic. It was  unique and pretty attractive. When I bought the skin there was  absolutely no warning that they could add a neck for no reason.

EPISCAM  GAMES can't  just go around ruining skins after people have paid for  them. This is like if they suddenly decided to make the Raven skin  naked. It's ridiculous and undermines the whole point of the purchase.  They fundementally changed the whole skin, and I'm outraged.

We  skin enthusiasts need to band together and refuse to buy any more skins  from EPISCAM GAMES until they revert the Whiteout """"changes"""". And  promise to never make """"changes"""" to skins without consulting the  rightful owners who OWN the skin they're """"changing"""". Why should  EPISCAM GAMES be allowed to """"change"""" my property without my consent  like that?

If  they're going to  bait-and-switch skins like this, it's frankly a scam.  They need to  either return the skin to it's original state before the """"change"""",  that people paid for, or refund the skin.",FortNiteBR

It can also be moved in any direction, as well as its camera able to look up and down. It also can be shot down with ease, as it has only 10 hp. The drone can only be stacked in two, and is automatically consumed along launch. Landing on a surface will keep the battery from draining, but will keep draining upon rising. It will be automatically destroyed soon Impact with a wall of ceiling, and the wall/ceiling will take no damage. The drone can be controlled from about 300 meters. standing on it will make it unable to fly. And finally, you can attach small items to the drone, such as a rift-to go, or boogie bomb. However, you could use it for offensive by attaching one c4 to the underside.

SMGs are the most broken part about this game at the moment, with shotguns being rendered useless (even the double barrel fires blanks). Buildings have less HP than ever to top that, meaning that anything you build immediately gets shredded, leaving building pointless too. 

This game turned from a great twist on modern Battle Royale, to a generic shooter which rewards spraying SMGs to combat what was so unique in the first place... building. It seems like Epic have decided to cater towards their newer players, making it easier for them to compete with players from the past, whilst players from the past get punished by using tactics of old, such as the double shotgun meta. I‚Äôm not saying that I want the shotgun meta back, but I would at least like to pick up a shotgun and feel comfortable at close range. Drum guns are broken, 50 bullets in a mag with as much damage as they do is beyond ridiculous, especially as they are so good against opponents structures. And considering how accurate they are, they‚Äôve become a must have in someone‚Äôs set-up to win a gun fight.

I may come across as a salty guy who just came off a loss to the new meta (yes, that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm writing this), but I hope that I can stem a discussion over on Reddit and at Epic themselves, on what happens with the game moving forward and we want as a community. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I hope some of you agree and can understand my perspective on things, a perspective of which has already been mentioned by many, I know.

TL;DR Spray meta is stupidly overpowered, shotguns are awful, building is becoming pointless, please balance the game Epic?

Thanks",FortNiteBR

With 26 days left in the season I decided, my cousin doesnt play often so itll take him awhile to get max ragnarok so imma help him out. Ive ran the numbers and i need like 10 hours play time a day every day for 25 days to get max ragnarok for both of us

I know you can get it in season 6 but all im asking is for someone to hop into a few games of 50v50 with me every now and again and help out with the xp gain. Thanks in advance to anyone who does wanna help out

Oh and I wont have a mic. Its 50v50 so it shouldnt matter",FortNiteBR

So I recently decided to get ahead about a month ago and start practicing with keyboard and mouse. I know most of you have controversy over this, and can tell you for a fact it‚Äôs faster to build and easier to switch weapons at the press of a key. But it‚Äôs not as great as it seems! A big drawback is your aim with a mouse on console is terrible. It‚Äôs hard to line up a shot, and maybe it‚Äôs just the 60fps talking or the dpi and mouse sensitivity just don‚Äôt line up on console. I use a RAZER DEATHADDER ELITE if that makes a huge difference and would like to see what some of you use as your dpi/sens to help with your aim to those that do use keyboard and mouse on console. (Also I do use a 75hz ASUS monitor with a 1ms response time)",FortNiteBR

Honestly there are a lot of people who act like entitled little kids in the sub. They complain how it’s a giant sweat fest but the problem isn’t them, the problem is with the person who constantly complains about good players when they haven’t adapted to how the meta has changed at all. If you don’t like it then don’t play it. It’s that simple. If you want to play the game you have to improve if you want to win just like everybody else who plays this game wants to do. They want to win. So quit complaining about ttv kids, soccer skins, fake defaults, etc. and just play the game to improve and not to win. Winning will come in time.

Before you all start a riot and assume I'm the stereotypical self proclaimed ""OG"" player, I'm not. Set your bias aside for a minute.

Games like Fortnite, being a repetitive battle royale game, should really have items/cosmetics that you can't simply buy and that you need to earn.

I think it's a great thing to reward players who decide to put a lot of time into the game because they really care about the game and love it.

I've seen a lot of people say that they want the lights back because they didn't have time or they weren't good enough, etc. I'm sorry but that's just life. I don't think it's reasonable to request an item that was meant to be grinded for to be return because of that.

The game hardly does anything to reward players who put a lot of time into it anymore, tier 100 means nothing as you can just buy it or get it easily with weekly challenges.

The only thing the game really has anymore that you can grind for and not buy is the Level 100 banners which I really like. The weekly challenge skins don't really count because they are very easy to obtain.",FortNiteBR

We’re lucky Epic is such a great group of devs and they regularly communicate with the community. That is a privilege, not a right. Stop acting like you know more about the game and where it should lead into the future than the people who CREATED the fucking game. 

- nobody cares what season you started playing in. 
Nobody cares what “OG omg super rare” skin you have. 

- Wrap and background designs are generally cool and well done, but are way too common and shouldn’t be 50% of this subs content 

- Fortnite isn’t dying. Apex isn’t killing Fortnite. Two games in the same genre can exist at the same time. 

-Some people like to play this game for fun. Others like to play to win. That’s ok. Let’s work out a way where both these play styles can both have their fun, and stop bickering like a bunch of fucktards 

- Some people might like a feature of the game that you personally dislike. That’s ok. Like above, arguing will get you nowhere.

Ever since the update where they implemented the siphon mechanic from the LTM into the real game, I get finished right after I get knocked down around a good 85% of the time. Gaining HP and shield back after battles is great because it helps you recover after a fight, but it also encourages finishing off everyone you knock. I think it would be better if you got the health after the entire team is dead to fix this problem. It's nice to get HP after knocking somebody, but you can only imagine how sad that Jonesy was when you bludgeoned him with your pickaxe. You still get your health back in the end, so staying alive after a big fight is easier.

Every new item is either broken (quadlauncher, boom boxes, the sword) or pretty useless. (Infantry rifle, scoped revolver, ice traps/grenades) 

I hope this gun is addressed soon, because its drop rate is insanely high and it can consistently ruin early game for players. ",FortNiteBR

I started playing this game the day after it went free to play and the first time i went to play it i liked it however i didn't think much of it, just another battle royale game, but this time with building, however as time went on i slowly but surely enjoyed the game more and more, getting involved with the community around season 3 and ever since then have played the game regularly.

and as time went on there was more and more talk about these sweats around the community, but for me it wasn't to an unplayable extent, but it problem was, it was getting worse, a LOT worse with time.
and as season 8 rolled around it got to an unplayable level for me, I simply cannot go a single game without seeing at least 5-10 sweats and i think load of people will be able to relate to me on this one.

How do we fix this?
Well, that's simple we just need a ranked system a way to make it so people can play against other people who are on the same level of play as them. I know this will cause a few problems like smurfing, longer wait times etc. but that's why I suggest we have it as an alternative to normal play. I do know that tournaments do exist in the game and they are (sort of) rank based, however most of them (if not all of them) can only be played a certain number of times, not only that but also the fact that tournaments are not always available to play.

All of this said, I have nothing wrong with tryhards/sweats they play the game how they like to, and if that involves doing their best to win no matter the cost or trying to be the best, so be it. 

Tl;dr: Game is being infested with sweats and Epic should add a ranked mode to even the playing field.

The mode has essentially become incredibly unbalanced. There are no close games, at all. EVERY game I've played since 7.40 has been a 40 point blowout one way or the other. 

Part of the issue is heal on kill, which gives the team on the ground a massive advantage over respawning players, that of having twice as much health, as well as the ability to shoot at them on the way down. Landing with 65-100 health and being made to fight people at 200 health makes comebacks impossible now.

Another issue? Red Vending Machines. I don't know if they're intended to function as they are now, but since no Epic employee has commented, I'm going to assume it's an intended feature. Here's the issue. They can give any legendary item. One team can find a red vending machine with RPGs and shotguns, and the other team can find one with 2 of the same sniper and a mounted turret, or simply not find one at all. It also causes massive FPS drops because players spam it for ammo. 

RPGs are still an issue, landing, blowing yourself up, and killing someone is a viable strategy that should've been removed months ago. 

Players should also only respawn on their own half of the circle. Too often players just land behind you and blow you away with a shotgun or RPG. It's exacerbated by the bugs with weapon audio levels and glider/footstep sounds. 

Some of these issues have been issues for quite a while, and have been ignored, such as respawn location and the RPG strat of killing yourself to get kills. Instead of fixing those problems, they've ignored them, and now there are even more issues such as the vending machines and heal on kill creating blowout games. 

I don't know what else to say. This is the mode that I play for a casual experience, and it feels ruined by these various issues, and Epic is totally silent. ",FortNiteBR

Risk has been reduced, and loadouts have been changed as a result of this.  A good player, when equipped with no heals without max HP would sometimes pass up unnecessary fights, as they want to win and get to end game.  This is completely gone now, W key push mentality has taken over, as you are rewarded for pushing people now with health back after each kill.  This makes it a paradise for the ultra sweaty players, and a nightmare for casual players who just want to have fun.  Everyone is pushed all the time now, no one is left alone.  There is no more contemplating for the sweaty players whether or not a fight is worth it, in pubs, every fight is worth it now because they get health for the kills.  This has changed the game entirely.  Streamers now run glider redeploy instead of heals, they push everywhere all over the map with no risk if they are skilled enough.  It used to be where a sweaty player would be risking a lot if they had no heals sitting under 100hp, now a sweaty player is never under 100hp, they push everything everywhere, and casual players are feeling it.  SBMM is not the answer, removing the 50 health per kill is the answer.  I love this addition, but also see what it is doing to the game and would not mind seeing it removed. ",FortNiteBR

Because right now, for those of us that are only ever going to be decent at the game, at best, its been lacking the fun of earlier days when the skill gap was smaller. I am nearly forty years old, and have only recently been reintroduced to the magic of video games via my son after years of not paying attention, at all (and boy, have I missed a lot!), so there is a huge skill gap between myself and the better players. Actually, the game does not feel random to me at all. In fact, its pretty damn predictable. I drop, maybe get a kill or two, if I am lucky enough to encounter other players at my skill level, only to be utterly annihilated by the first good player I encounter who can out build, out shoot, hell, out everything me.  

It would be nice for some of us more casual players who love the game, but have kind of hit our ceiling at the moment, and take longer to improve than others, to have an option to play against one another, while still allowing those who are capable of improving rapidly to play the standard way, and potentially face off against players that are above themselves considerably.

Anyways, its just a thought. I am, of course, open to hearing counter points, but please don't be too hard on me in the event that you vehemently disagree, and want to comment.",FortNiteBR

I've tried everything I can think of: Watching tutorial videos and pro steamers. Landing in Tilted over and over, landing in safe areas like Lucky. I watch replays of my games to see where I went wrong and where I can improve. But despite all of that, no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to get a win. Just getting a kill feels like a victory for me.

Just in case any of this information is relevant:

\- I've played 960 games and have a 0.45 KD.

\- I only have 2 wins, and even then, I don't feel like they should count. The first was during Fortnitemares, which was a mess, and the second was because of the sword, which was obviously OP.

\- I'm 17 and Fortnite is my second PvP shooter and my first BR game; I grew up mostly playing slow-paced strategy games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem

\- I play with Builder Pro, Turbo Build enabled.

\- I play on XB1

\- Sensitivities- 0.61 X, 0.42 Y, 0.515 ADS, 0.42 Scope, 1.64 Building.

I think my three biggest problems are my lack of confidence, my bad aim, and my tunnel-visioning.

I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldn't beat myself up for being bad since I'm still pretty new to both Shooters and PvP games, and I try to find something I did right in a game to make myself feel less upset. But no matter how much I do this, I eventually get very upset and have to force myself to stop playing just to try and calm myself down.

In terms of aim, It goes hand-in-hand with my inexperience. I know that aim comes with time and practice, and that it's much harder to aim with a controller then on PC.

But I think my tunnel-vision is my biggest problem. I'll try to go into a game to work on a specific aspect that I want to improve on only to have my brain completely flat-line, leading me to ""go through the motions"" without thinking or planning.

It's just so soul-crushing to try so hard at something for so long and seemingly make no ground. I WANT to get good at the game, and I WANT to enjoy it, but it's just too hard for me to do either of those things as I am.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

Now I do understand that this game is getting very boring and hard for casuals, because there are so many good players that will just kill you immediately, however, the hate on all of these ‘sweaty’ players is completely unnecessary and in my opinion, quite toxic.
People need to realise that others enjoy the game differently to other people.
Lately i’ve been seeing posts about how someone wants to kill soccer skins IRL and how ‘sweats’ are ruining the game. First of all, no they aren’t, Fortnite is ruining their own game by not adding RANKED.

I’m probably going to get downvoted for this but this sort of hate needs to stop over a game.

TL;DR : The hate on good players is completely unnecessary and Fortnite should add RANKED to make everyone happy.

Actually, I would like to discuss how one or the other, or even both in conjunction, would not be the right solution.

#How did we get here?

Back in the day, Battle-Royale had a small range of skill. Building was used sparingly, maybe just for simple cover or for going up a hill. The game was mostly just an indie battle-royale game with basic bloom mechanics. Over the course of the seasons this has changed drastically in all aspects. Building and editing has quite literally gone to new heights. Players are skilled with all ranges of new and improved items. The introduction of Playground and Creative boosted this even further by allowing players to master these skills in unprecedented fashion. However, not everyone is interested in pushing themselves and training like this. Whether because they don't have much time to play or just simply don't want to dedicate themselves to it, they would rather play the game casually and naturally become better over time. Some players improve quickly, others not so much.

Because Battle-Royale uses a simple connection based matchmaking system it has always had the potential to create matches of extremely wide skill levels. The way I see it, as the range of skill increased, it eventually got to the point that lower skilled players were then discouraged from playing in the base Solo, Duo, and Squad modes. Then the skill ceiling kept becoming higher and another section of lower skilled players were discouraged from playing in the base modes. This feedback loop has compounded on itself over and over as lower skilled players stop playing, allowing for more higher skilled players, then discouraging more low skilled players, etc. Today it has recently gotten to the point that matches have a majority of high skilled players and now moderate players are being discouraged from playing. Even high skilled players have not been happy with how competitive base mode matches have become.

#Skill Based Matchmaking

By implementing skill based matchmaking into the base modes, matches would consist of players of similar skill levels. Although this would technically create fairer matches, much of the community feels this goes against their philosophy of Battle-Royale; that it should be survival of the fittest. In other words, Battle-Royale matches are meant to have some range of skill and be an opportunity to improve and test your skills. If you are placed in matches with players similar to your skill level, not only can you still not exactly play casually, but there also isn't much opportunity to challenge yourself should you want to. Sure, you will gradually improve as you play against players close to your skill level, but you'll never run into the John Wick final boss that truly challenges you; something both sides of the skill spectrum will miss if matchmaking becomes too mundane.

There have actually been rumors that that Epic secretly started SBMM in the base modes as early as January. Many high skilled players and content creators have been outspoken about how this must be the case because they've found base mode matches are full of higher skilled players similar to them. I would like to again bring up my feedback loop theory: I don't think there is a hidden SBMM system putting you against other high skilled players, but that there are simply less players who are lower skilled than you queuing the base modes anymore. This is further supported by the fact even low skilled players are experiencing the issue of rampant high skilled players when, if there really is a hidden SBMM system, they should be placed with players close to their skill level.

My point being, with SBMM matches could be just as sweaty for these high skilled players as they are now and also wouldn't provide the opportunity for a casual battle-royale experience players yearn for while still occasionally challenging them.

#Ranked

Adding ranked modes would supposedly solve the issue by giving high skilled players separate playlists to play in, thus allowing the casual playerbase to flourish in the base modes again. This makes sense at face value, but I don't think this will entirely solve the problem for casual players because:

1. I'd wager most players interested in ranked would not want to jump into the ranked modes immediately every play session since they could risk having a bad first game and losing precious skill points, so they would want to warm up in the casual modes first.
2. There are players who just like getting high kill games and pwning noobs for the fun of it, so they would still play the casual modes.
3. Not all high skilled players will feel like dedicating themselves to ranked modes if they have less time to play than they used to, and so will simply want a quick match in casual.
4. Ranked would also use SBMM, and being as strict as a ranked mode should be, ranked matches would be even sweatier for higher skilled players than the base modes currently are now, so not all high skilled players would enjoy ranked if they already don't enjoy the base modes as they are now.

Basically, although adding ranked modes would remove a portion of sweaty players from casual modes, there would still be enough in rotation to put a damper on lower skilled or casual players. However, I do still think it is important to have ranked modes. Competitive players probably would like to have strict matchmaking and to be put in lobbies with players close to their skill level. 

#Creating a Matchmaking System Built for Battle-Royale

What the base modes need is a matchmaking system that allows for players to be put in fair ranges of skill levels while still being occasionally challenged, but to still be able to play casually without feeling constantly overburdened by higher or similarly skilled players. This is very contradictory. Obviously those conditions cannot be met in a single match. So, what I'm proposing is a variable matchmaking system that automatically rotates between these conditions.

How it would work is, based on how well you did in your last few matches, in your next match you could be the highest skilled player, the lowest skilled player, or anywhere in between. Died a few times in a row before top 70? Let's go a little easier on you this time. 15 kills and top 5? Get ready for a challenge! Did about as well this game as the last few? Found the sweet spot until you improve or have a bad set of matches. In a perfect sense it would be a matchmaking system catered to you.

Variable skill matchmaking along with ranked modes would allow for players of large skill ranges and play types to enjoy the game again. Although players of all skill levels will have the opportunity to play casually, if they are playing well, they will then be challenged by players somewhat higher skilled than them. If they keep playing well, matchmaking will keep putting them with slightly higher and higher skilled players. If they don't keep playing well, they'll stay where they are and be the ones who challenge the lower skilled players below them. This also means that if players are having bad games, they'll be given the opportunity to be the higher skilled players playing against players slightly below them.

The end result is a constant rotation of skill levels automatically queuing for matches of lower or higher skill criteria to challenge or be challenged by players of marginally better and worse skill; whether they are trying to improve themselves, or just play casually. This system would also more than likely have less trouble matchmaking than SBMM since it is meant to have a wider range of skill in each match instead of finding players within a strict skill level.

All of this wouldn't be possible if Fortnite had a smaller player base, but as it turns out it has a GINORMOUS player base. Epic was ready to pull the trigger on SBMM over a year ago when there were 45 million players, and that number has more than quadrupled since then to 200 million players. With a player base this large they have the opportunity to create a matchmaking system beyond SBMM; one that can be catered to providing the best battle-royale experience.

#Determining a Good, Bad, or Neutral Match

In many other competitive games, there are clearly defined winners and losers such as on two teams. All that is needed is some formula to figure out the skill rating points gained and lost by comparing everyone's skill rating in the match.

Fortnite is an entirely different ballgame. Determining whether you had a good or bad game will be a tough thing to calculate because it would need to rely on actual gameplay. What number you placed, how long you survived, and how many eliminations you got are obvious examples. But what about the skill rating of the players you eliminated, the skill rating of the players they had eliminated, the skill rating of the player who finally eliminated you, how many players that player had eliminated before they eliminated you and what all their skill ratings were too? It could go all the way up the chain to the first players who were eliminated. Even mundane things like how much you looted, how much you harvested, how far you traveled, how much you built, or what variety of items or traps you used. All of these could be used to determine how many skill rating points you should go up or down after a match. Figuring out what will take part in the formula and balancing how much influence each aspect of it should have will take time, so it is a good thing this is an early access game, right?

#TL;DR

Skill based matchmaking is not a good fit for the base modes because for many it defeats the purpose of Battle-Royale, that it's meant to have some range of skill and be an opportunity to improve and test your skills. If you are placed in matches with players similar to your skill level, not only can you still not exactly play casually, but there also isn't much opportunity to challenge yourself should you want to. For high skilled players it would also just make matches worse for them than they are now.

Ranked modes are not enough to remove high skilled players from the base modes because many high skilled players would not always be interested in playing ranked for a number of reasons, so there would still be enough high skilled players in rotation to put a damper on lower skilled or casual players. Ranked modes are still important however for high skilled or competitive players that want to have strict matchmaking and to be put in lobbies with players close to their skill level.

What the base modes need is a matchmaking system that allows for players to be put in fair ranges of skill levels while still being occasionally challenged, but to still be able to play casually without feeling constantly overburdened by higher or similarly skilled players. This could be accomplished by a variable matchmaking system that automatically places you in matches with a decent range of skill levels but, based on how well you did in your last few matches, sometimes you will be the highest skilled player, the lowest skilled player, or anywhere in between. The end result is a constant rotation of skill levels automatically queuing for lower or higher skill criteria to challenge or be challenged by players of better and worse skill, whether they are trying to improve themselves, or just play casually.",FortNiteBR

Or you can find a screenshot of it [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/WMeE3AX).

If Epic puts Galaxy in the item shop after the promotion ends wouldn't that technically be breaking the agreement made with customers that bought the phone/tablet aka making it illegal?

And yes, I know 99% of the sub doesn't care about this. But I personally think it is very shitty of Epic to put exclusive skins in the item shop. I know it is just a skin in a free to play game, but I'm thinking of the general moral here. This applies to a lot more than Fortnite skins. Companies shouldn't be free to break agreements made with customers that bought a specific product just because it can make them more money. A promise is a promise.

I'm a decent player who likes to win but also have fun. Which right now, is pretty much impossible to do. I've enjoyed season 8 a lot. The new locations are awesome and are honestly the first set of new locations that are actually worth it to land at imo. Replacing planes with vents and cannons has been phenomenal as well. However, there are some things that really need to be addressed and fixed/added to the game.

1. We need a skill based matchmaking system now more than ever, for solos especially. I have never faced so many sweaty and admittedly skilled players in the last 3 weeks than I have in my entire time playing this game. I enjoy a good build battle. It's Fortnite at it's peak honestly. But imagine being a beginner at this game or even someone who's been playing for only a month or two. There's no hope for them. I'll even admit, when I come across players like that every once in a while, I make a fool out of them. It's just too easy when you know how to take high ground and then just pump/build over and over. These players need a chance. And even I don't want to be fighting crazy sweaty players every freaking game.

2. The delay when switching back to a shotgun needs to go away IF you switch to another gun OTHER THAN a shotgun and SHOOT it. That needs to be the stipulation though, you must shoot the other gun in order for the delay to disappear when you switch back to your shotgun. I understand this could be somewhat exploited. But I really doubt that it's any faster to switch to another gun and shoot it before switching back, than it is to just shoot a pump twice in a row. And if it is, who cares honestly??

3. Audio needs to be fixed. ARs are ridiculously loud. Footsteps are nearly non existent when any gun is being fired. And same with gliders. I LOVE the new sound effects, they just need to be lessened in volume and footsteps NEED to be prioritized.

4. The infantry rifle drop rate needs to be decreased and either bring back the burst or increase the drop rate of ARs. Chests are literally not even worth it to land on anymore. Floor drops are the only viable thing to land on, cause at least you know what you're getting at that point. I've died in so many games due to getting a scoped revolver or an infantry rifle out of my first chest. It's just ridiculous.

5. This one is gonna be highly controversial. But honestly, we need the season 7 deagle back. Unless you are carrying clingers or stink grenades, there is almost no way to crack someone who's turtling, ESPECIALLY on console. Turtling is just the default thing to do now when you get beaten to high ground and it is so awful, especially with the rampant 3rd partying that happens now. If you don't finish a fight within 30-45 seconds, it's almost a guarantee that another player will join the fight. Which means that the player who turtled due to getting OUTPLAYED, can now sit in his box while you have to get attacked by yet another player. The deagle sped up fights so much and was a great counter to turtling. I personally think we need it back.

Anyways that's all I got for now. Again, I love a lot of what season 8 has introduced, but I think a lot can be done to make it even better. Lemme know if you agree/disagree. Peace ✌️",FortNiteBR

I sometimes duo with another battle pass player and obviously you get the additional exp advantage but what would people suggest is the best way to level up?


I play rumble often and get around 500exp a game which is good but those games can take ages to complete and pretty disheartening when my team is getting pumped rotten.


Any suggestions are appreciated!",FortNiteBR

* turbo building is retarded (no honestly pressing a button and dragging your mouse is not skill)
* game literally forces you to play close quaters because anyone can build a 1v1 in a flick of their wrist
* pump-&gt;smg swap is the meta for 4 seasons now, if that doesnt ring a bell that something is wrong, than i dont know what will
* give us the ranked system already, or change your game name to Scrimnight
* Health/shield on kill makes risky plays rewarding, And i think it's not good, it throws strategy out the window. Unless you can call 'YoLo' a strategy. Which clearly you do.

&amp;#x200B;

I played this game since season 2, and God was I hooked, when i finally learned how to build, It felt good, a month later you introduced turbo building, ever since then the game has become progressively worse. Nevertheless I've been playing despite that, I do love this game. The fact it took you 8 seasons to realize that having some sort of revive system in duos and squads is mindboggling, but damn I am thankfull you finally clicked, and hopefully it's coming soon. I can't remember the last time i was hitting shots with an Assault Rifle unless it was purple quality or higher. It seems to me like a lot of people at this point just accepts the unacceptable purely because how much time they spent in this game or how much money they've put into it. Don't get me wrong I am not hating on Epic Games here I DO NOT. I love the challanges I love the laughs, there are so many moments in this game that make it special, It's just that season to season finding those moments is getting harder and harder. 'Git Gut' 'You're just bad at the game' yeah prolly your thoughts, I am not some tfue or ninja that has 50x more playtime than any of you, hence their opinions should not be taken into consideration of balancing or changing the game. I do agree with some of what they are saying, but they are not the majority of the playerbase, but they made the game into a god damn scrim-monday, where i have 12 people boxed-in in the first moving circle... It's not fun, it's just not. 'don't like it stop playing' yeah i guess you're right, I will and so many others will quit with me, It might take some time for them to realize, depending on when they started, but it looks to me like yet another developer will kill their own product because of reckless balance changes, weather through adding a new item or straight-up removing them. Listening to your community is dope and I respect it, but somewhere on the way you lost your way with your own game and it just makes me sad.",FortNiteBR

I seem to only make it to top 3 and die , alot is due to solo teaming and PC players. I’m very good adt shooting but not building. Most games like COD enable some form of skill based matchmaking. I’ve played since season one and now that cross platform is enabled it’s increasingly hard to get a win. Imagine playing a company softball game with Mickey Mantle, that wouldn’t be very fun. Good players don’t want this because they make money off streaming and it promotes fortnite. The players who aren’t as good will leave and play fair games that do implement skil based play. I’ve reached my peak and I’m not that good at building. it’s extremely vexxing having 100-200 top 10s and I’ve only won 20 times out of nearly 6,000 matches. This game has become too difficult to enjoy. I cannot get the victory umbrella. I barely had 2 wins last season. PC players are at every advantage aiming and building. It’s not a fair game and the new or low skilled players will not get a victory umbrella. I usually don’t buy the battle pass but still all I want is a victory umbrella. Even thought about paying for a win it’s getting so difficult. Fortnite used to be simple and now it’s taking me forever just to get an umbrella. I cannot win I can get top 3 nearly every other time but cannot clutch a win. I always get out built or some Pc player laser shots me. Not sure if they cheat or their skill way outmatches mine. Sure fun for them but not for me. I will be quitting this game for good if I cannot get my victory umbrella. 

TL;DR too difficult to win because they don’t implement skill based matchmaking. Quitting fortnite because it’s too difficult to get a victory umbrella. Each season getting harder.",FortNiteBR

I'm a university student from the UK, currently in my final year of study towards a degree in Psychology. This being my final year, I have the task of producing a legitimate psychological study, so I'm looking for participants.

It's a daunting and difficult task for me, so I decided early on that I had to do something that I felt would be interesting to me personally. So, me being a gamer, I've decided to conduct my research into online gaming preferences and player experiences. And it being the phenomenon that it is, I figured Fortnite would provide the perfect means for an interesting case study!

My study is a survey consisting of multiple choice questions designed to gauge interest/agreement/level of engagement in response to the game and its various aspects. Full disclosure on how the study works and how any data will be handled is provided on the survey site. The survey should only take 10 minutes or less to complete.

If you are interested in participating, please follow the link at the bottom of this post. To anyone that does take part, I am eternally grateful for your involvement. If you have any questions about the study or for me personally, you can post to this thread or email me directly at: [anthonyoustudent@outlook.com](mailto:anthonyoustudent@outlook.com).

Thank you :)

Fortnite needs small team respawn game modes like 4v4 TDM or capture the flag, search and destroy etc. These modes will be fun for both casuals and sweats. Casuals will enjoy them because they will no longer lose 99% of their games and they are less likely to run into a TTV soccer skin while sweats will enjoy them because of the decreased RNG and fast-paced action. 

It will also be much easier to implement a ranked system in these modes because they will only have 8-12 players. It's impossible to have 24/7 ranked with console and PC lobbies separated in BR due to the player count (in OCE we don't even have duos most of the time).

And we need it bad. I am not blaming the tryhards. No, no, no. You NEED to tryhard to win. You NEED to practice hours upon hours upon HOURS to even be remotely good.

I played getaway when it came out and had a blast. It's definitely one of the best if not the best LTM. Since Getaway has been kind of foreshadowed, with that one banner icon and the entire theme right now being pirates and treasure, I have some theories and suggestions on what could happen.

1. Theory: They will introduce the Respawn Vans in Getaway. This is just a theory, but it kind of makes sense. The respawn vans would work well in getaway, considering it's better as a duo or squad mode. Plus, it will just be a cool way of introducing it. 

2. Mild Theory: I'm not too sure about this one but it might have some gameplay mechanics changed so it could use those maps that were revealed a bit ago?

3. Theory: If Getaway does return, Wild Card will come back. But I don't think he will come with a new style. If it doesn't, we shouldn't get mad. We'll just have more members of the Getaway Gang! 

4. Suggestion: New Getaway Challenges. If the Getaway will come back, Then it will probably be a super fleshed out LTM with an event coming with it, and Challenges too. I'm thinking 3 Challenges. The rewards will probably be something along the lines of: A spray of Wild Card or Ace, Maybe an emote or emoticon, not sure, and A Music Track for the theme that plays when you win a game of Getaway. The unlock for completing all 3 challenges would probably be a banner of Wild Card, because Epic has just been making the final unlockable for a lot of challenges a banner.

I most likely am just over-thinking this, but hey, you never know, right?",FortNiteBR

Then as the game progresses more items are added to the loot pool, such as pistols, mobility items, and throwables to add incentive to loot mid game as well. I believe this would balance early game so people don't have to pray to rng for a usable gun early game (shotguns/smgs/ars) and so you don't just find gray pistols or infantry rifles while someone gets a scar or pump.

(we also included some cool item shop ideas and fresh updates to keep the game fresh and new!)

Vaults:

&amp;#x200B;

• Heavy AR The Heavy AR is a great weapon, but picking up other variants of ARs does not feel rewarding anymore, vaulting this weapon would make ARs and Scars feel amazing again.

• Scoped Revolver.. The Scoped Revolver while a great weapon does not fit Fortnite Battle Royale’s play style.

• Scoped AR The Scoped AR like the Scoped Revolver does not compare to other weapon choices

• Suppressed SMG the suppressed machine gun would be vaulted due to it being replaced by the Tactical Submachine Gun, the reason for this being Double Pump’s implementation would be balanced by a better sub machine gun variant

• Dynamite The dynamite is way to overpowered in too many scenarios, vaulting this explosive would help rebalance the game

• Suppressed Scar The Suppressed Scar is a useless item and has way too much Bloom to be used

• Thermal Scoped AR The Thermal Scoped AR does not fit Fortnite at all and needs to be vaulted

• Silenced Sniper The Silenced Sniper does not feel rewarding as a sniper it’s vault would bring back the rewarding Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle.

•  Stink Bombs the stink bombs are either very useless or very annoying, hence it’s vault

• Suppressed Pistol The  Suppressed Pistol does not fit the play style of the current meta of Fortnite and is a very useless gun to pick up, it’s vault would help up the chance of better weapons

• Fireworks are very useless due to its inaccuracy and it’s low damage.. it’s vault would help bring better loot to chests

\* Infantry Rifle The infantry rifle is to controversial and has too low of a magazine to do anything, it’s vault would be much appreciated by the community

&amp;#x200B;

Additions:

&amp;#x200B;

•Heavy Shotgun The Heavy Shotgun was the legendary and epic version of the Tactical Shotgun, to rebalance the Shotgun variants bringing back this shotgun type would help

•Common Pump Shotgun The Common Pump Shotgun would simply help finalize the shotgun variants damage listed in the parentheses (90 Damage 180 Headshot)

• Revolver The Revolver was a skilled based weapon and would help replace the missing Scoped Revolver

• Bolt Action Sniper.. the Bolt Action Sniper Rifle  was a rewarding sniper rifle and would be a great replacement to the unrewarding Suppressed Sniper

• Impulse Grenades.. Mobility especially with ATK’s Shopping Carts and Planes gone is limited.. re-adding Impulse Grenades would balance the lack of mobility

• Tactical SMG would be a great replacement to the Suppressed SMG and would balance Double Pump

&amp;#x200B;

Gameplay:

&amp;#x200B;

LTMs Update!  Team Rumble and 50v50 are here to stay! Team Rumble an 50v50 switch between each other each update dive into those large squad games now!

LTMs Swap! LTMs swap between each other every 2 days providing you all with new and fresh content consistently

Double Pump has been reimplemented but pull out time has been nerfed to rebalance the high amount of damage and fast fire rate... pull out time would be around 0.25-0.50 seconds... still giving you the viable option of SMGs

Skill based matchmaking implemented. The Skill Base matchmaking system would be based off K/D ratio, Wins, etc for that particular Season... Season Skill Based Matchmaking is necessary because people’s skill can vary between seasons due to changes in meta and breaks. This addition welcomes newer players and professionals of all kinds..

Item Shop update! Every Thursday and Saturday new skins come out as per usual but 2 other featured sets will come out along with it and 6 other daily items. Providing players with new outfits that they want to appear in the item shop more consistently 2 of those Daily items will be Community Picks! Everyday 6  rare or common items at the bottom of the screen for you to choose! It’s time for the community to choose!

I think this is great, because it shows how much the game has progressed, and it makes winning very rewarding. However, ff ranked doesn't get introduced, this game could potentially be crushed by forcing those average to even above average players to just ditch it. Most people will just say ""get good"", etc. But it's not that simple.

I love this game. I don't think there's anything wrong with the way people are playing. People play to win. However, if ranked mode won't get introduced, I find it hard to believe that the 50% or so of players who don't get the chance to play 6 hours per-day/don't sweat in creative will absolutely abandon this game in the near future. 

Each game is treated like a scrim and this is just pushing casual players out. I think the introduction of ranked would provide a spot for extremely competitive players to battle and showcase their skills, and also allow pubs to be more enjoyable for even the players who play 3 hours per night but don't want to practice 90s and turtling in Creative for an hour each day before hopping into matches.",FortNiteBR

2. ""sweaty TTV's.  I think if you have TTV or YT in your name you should automatically be put into streamer mode so that the casuals don't get pissed.
3. New LTM. Add a new ltm where you can only build 1 or 2 levels up from the ground or buildings, it would make it more interesting and allow casuals to rely on other skills like aiming which can carry over to a lot more games than building.
4. Add a ranked mode. Add a ranked mode so the ""sweats"" can play there and us casuals can actually enjoy the game.
5. Add cool items. add cool items that make it easier for casuals to win.

Make the first circle chests have a lower chance of you getting a sniper. Make AR’s and SMG’s more common during the first circle. As the game goes on make snipers more common.

Obviously some people are just always going to be better than me, but it’s at the point where it’s impossible to have any fun solo queuing or playing anything other than LTMs. I think competitive good Fortnite players are great, but I just really really would love a full separate ranked mode for them to go nuts in so I’m able to lay back on my couch and game casually to have fun, not hunched over my monitor with a bucket to collect my ball sweat.

Many items that exist in the item pool are completely irrelevant and provide no purpose other than being fucking annoying.

   
**- Vault scoped AR**

Absolutely irrelevant and clogs up the loot pool.

**- Vault or limit clingers**

Broken. Vaulted because they were broken and were re-added with no change to them. At least limit the number of clingers to three.

**- Vault dynamite**

The amount of area that dynamite covers is absolutely ridiculous. Very spammable and completely negates building in a fight and does not allow any skill to be used.

**- Vault bottle-rockets**

No explanation needed for this.

**- Vault M1 Garand**

Hands down the worst weapon in the game. All it is is an AK with projectiles, so nobody would ever want to use this gun. 

**- Vault silenced pistol**

Irrelevant, clogs up loot pool.

**- Vault scoped revolver** 

Budget deagle, nobody uses it and a silly excuse of a weapon.

**- Add heavy shotgun back**

The heavy shotgun promoted skill as the reticle was smaller, which rewarded players with good aim and provided a different play-style.

**- Revert shotgun range changes**

Shotguns are now peashooters from anywhere other than in the same tile.

**- Dissolve snow area** 

At least make it smaller, the region is much too large.

Game was fun as hell, it was a game for me and my friends, PUBG but Disney. Over time the game got more popular, especially March 5th, 2018. Some streamer named Ninja played some games with the rapper Drake, you know, the one who made Hotline Bling, Nice For What, Feel No Ways. It was on July 12th, 2018 when I noticed something. The state of the community got worse. I entered squad fill games just to hear 10 year olds shoving they’re mic down they’re throat. ""Rez Me Rez Me"" is what I would hear. Some kids even called me Ni****, I noticed the community got more... toxic. On September 18th, 2018 I went back on the game, new season, I’ll give it a try. Me and my friends had a fucking blast, the only thing that ruined it was these guys all around the map, no backbling, female skin (they probably thought it made they’re hit box smaller) TTV in they’re name. It seemed like the community just became Pro League wannabes. Season 7 started, that first week I played it I thought to myself ""What the fuck has this game become, TTV kids playing with a skin of a country they didn’t know existed, Planes flying around, Kids freaking out because I had a 'rare' outfit"" Bruh this game just felt like a mess. To this point at Season 8 I still think this, where the fuck is this game going? This game now has a Volcano?? A fucking Volcano, we had a cube 2 seasons ago how about we add that back.

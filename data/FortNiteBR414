For all the people that are going to say ""Have more sense of your surroundings"" ""Oh just avoid them"" or ""Just check every roof, wall, and floor""

It has nothing to do with awareness of your surroundings:

1. It's not natural to look up in a game where people are on the ground, you can get shoot if you look up

2. You might be running from a guy and entering a house, then get killed by a random trap that somebody that had already died placed

3. It might be on a random spot on the roof that you couldn't see after you have checked all the other spots

It leads to random deaths, which means not very fun gameplay. Horrible game design",FortNiteBR

Honestly I'm gonna probably be downvoted for this but I think it's luck based. I just played a game where I shot this one guy and he was shooting back, missed every single shot on me. So I started building because I thought he might actually start hitting me. He started building up, jumped down but I came around him, started shooting him with a tactical shotgun (for only 8 damage, point blank range...) and he just comes around and gets a lucky headshot on me with a tactical, while I had 50 armor and 100 HP. the guy had 3 hp left. Keep in mind the guy missed every rifle shot.

I have been playing for about a month and am a pretty average player. That being said, I have recently started making it to the end of the game pretty consistently, but I never have an idea of what to do or where to go when the circle is small enough to be down to those last 10-15 people.

Like at the beginning of the game I drop in Salty Springs. I loot up/fight until I have the ideal load out I want then I start running for the circle. Every time. If I make it out of Salty, it's usually an automatic 3-6 kills and I make it to the top 20 at least, so I know I'm not too bad at combat.

Is there a certain mindset I can go into endgame with comparable to how I start a game or is it 100% instinctual? I feel like I've plateaued at the top 20 and don't really know how to improve that part of my game.

This action could be taken before any sort of a ban would be implemented? 

I've usually been killed by 2-3 players when it happens, so I doubt team killers would have trouble finding friends to play with when the option is disabled. If not? Then tough stick to solo until it lifts, otherwise you'll be solo in squad games.

Something that players didn't noticed is that when you equip an item from the ground, there is a delay before it registers into your inventory.


That delay has an animation where the item you just picked up will float above your head and disappears, and the item you switched with will drop right after. The animation lasts for 0.25s. It is little but enough to fuck up something.

&gt; You have a **full inventory**. Right now, you are holding an **SMG**. You see a **golden Scar**. You *picked up* that Scar. While the Scar is still floating above your head, you *suddenly switch* to your **Bolt-Action** for some reason. The Scar's animation is finally over afterwards. 

&gt; Guess what happens next?

&gt; You **didn't drop** your SMG, you **dropped** your Bolt-Action.


---

That, my friend, is how you lost your guns. Sometimes, if you loot to fast, you didn't even see what you're losing.

*TL;DR:* **After you equipped a gun on the floor, make sure the equip animation is finished before switching to another gun.**

Oh and BTW, Fortnite Battle Royale is arguably my favorite game if this generation.  Waiting to see if it eclipses Overwatch.

Here's the deal...

1. The bush sucks.  It's a legendary item that no one is excited to see or use.

2.  The silenced SMG sucks.  It's better than what it was but the moment players find an AR, they swap over to that.  Adds nothing new to the game.

3.  Smoke grenades suck.  They're used in extremely niche scenarios and are always dropped out in favor of real grenades.  They could use a buff of some sort.

4.  The Boogie Bomb.  Now that it's 5 seconds, it's better but I think we can all agree that it's a pretty standard/boring/safe addition to the game.  Meh.

5.  The spike traps are the most boring, safest concept of a trap one could conjure up.  It does instant damage, whoop de do.  It's nice that they removed the two other garbage traps but I think we're done with this PvE holdover.

As of right now, Epic has added one excellent item/weapon addition to the game and that's the launch pad.  That's a pretty terrible batting record if we're keeping score.

Now don't get me wrong.  I think Epic is doing an excellent job on the game.  This is just one area where they seem to really be strugging with.

Epic, I'd like to see you do one of two things.  Take a week or two to properly buff your less than compelling items, or give us an item that actually shakes up the way we play Fortnite (ala Launch Pad)

We have the different classes of weapons already and so a legendary melee sword would be a great new addition to the arsenal.

What im thinking is: A legendary sword that is exclusive to the airdrop only! 
Once you pick it up you have a total of 5 swipes with the sword before it disappears.

New mechanic: Basically you're going to have to hold to charge the sword, so the longer you charge it the more damage it will do. Up to a maximum of 200 damage.

Full charge: 200 damage
Medium charge: 125 damage
No charge: 75 damage 

tapping the shoot button once will simply slice anyone infront you, charging it will in addition to doing more damage also launch you forward, (very small leap, as gap closer).

Stats:

Durability: 5

Damage: 200

Rarity: Legendary (airdrop only) ",FortNiteBR

It takes 8 bullets to down someone given all your shots connect, but that just isnt possible, given that we have bloom. Maybe the new shooting model will change that but i dont know for sure.

My suggestion would be buffing light ammo drops to 18-20 per drop, that way you can get a full mag, just like ARs and Shotguns, in 2 ammo drops instead of 3.

Opinions?

As most of you have mentioned, its effect has been a bit stronger than we expected.

In the short-term, we’re going to reduce the effect of the dance to 5 seconds. We don’t think this is going to be a silver bullet, but it should help alleviate some of the frustrations with its current implementation.

Moving forward we have a few ideas to address the core issue: the person being attacked by a Boogie Bomb needs an opportunity to respond. There are a number of suggestions we’ll be evaluating, including (but not limited to):

 * Remove the instant explosion, making it bounce and detonate like a normal grenade
 * Have it create a ‘dance zone’, where the effect goes away if you leave the area
 * Disable the dance effect when taking damage
 * Allow players to build while dancing

Additionally, we’re continuing to work on improvements to our hotfix system. This will allow us to tweak more than just balance numbers without requiring a full client patch, but we’re not quite there yet. Thanks for your patience!

Thanks to everyone who’s provided feedback about this topic. Let us know below how you’d like to see the Boogie Bomb adjusted!

I love the game, it provided me fun like no other multiplayer game this year, but lately I’ve found myself unable to play it.

A day before the ban, out of the blue i started getting kicked out of the game with a warning telling me to disable my VPN. That never happened before, neither did i ever use VPN while playing fortnite. After a couple tries and a couple checks if i have VPN disabled i decided it was a server bug, gave up and called it a day. 

The next day, after i tried logging in to the launcher, It didnt let me. It told me the account was deleted for „cheating”.

Naturally, I’ve sent the support an e-mail describing my situation, That was over a week ago.

I was told to wait 1-2 days, yet here I am, with still no response.

Of course, I wasnt cheating. That would be stupid, considering I own save the world, and I really wouldnt be making a fuss if I deserved the ban.

After a week of waiting, I would really like to play the game, especially after I didnt do anything wrong.

If any Epic Games staff sees this, Please update me on my situation.
I’d be happy to provide more details.

Thank you for reading, happy gaming!

1. Parachutes ejecting five feet below mine, in the exact same spot

2. People one shotting me with guns they've not even pulled out yet.

3. Someone landing next to a pump shotgun before me despite me being about 10 feet below them.

4. Someone who I saw land literally just pull a Tact Shotgun right out of his fucking ass even though I had already taken all the weapons in the building and a Tact Shotgun was not one of them, then once again one shotting me before the gun was even in his hand, aaand

5. Seeing someone and switching to a gun only to stand around, frozen with your pickaxe in hand, waiting to be killed.

It's such fucking bollocks and, honestly, people on here shit on it so much and I didn't like comparing them at first, but since the last update, PUBG shits all over FN. I'll take a game with some graphical bugs over a game riddled with fucking bulllshit every day of the week. And this time, I actually have game clips, so I'll upload them if you want them (need to clear some space first though)

**EDIT** Okay so this post was very reactionary. I don't think this game is as bad as I say, and that was just because I was pissed. But that isn't to say there isn't a hell of alot of absolute shit in it. I know alot of my friends echo my opinion, including one with multiple wins to his name. I'm not the best, couple wins to my name, more second places on Solos but hey ho, I'm not exactly bad. My internet is fine and yet since the last update I'm having these recurring problems. One thing I will say on the glider speed thing: I hope it's not because the gliders you unlock with V Bucks are faster. The last thing this game needs is to become pay to win.",FortNiteBR

You can try to snipe them in their fucking boring tower and even tho you hit them they still always survive that even tho only their head is visible, and you never get a change to shoot agaim because you have to spam build so you don't die.

Also when I use rocket launchers, I have to load them between each shot which is something that seems missing from the opponents.

Nope, but it's the fastest way for us to do them if we group up. Once we finish we go back into our squads. 

Anyways I feel like the solo missions should be taken out and replaced with something else. It might not be a big issue but I certainly do it and will continue to do it so I can get my rewards fast and dip out of solo.

A fort created by a player will then be uploaded and added to a pool of other player-created forts. On the island, there are 4 or so designated “player creation” spots where the game pulls from the pool of players’ forts and places one in each spot.

This would add:

- more variation to player experience
- ability to get creative
- more reason to level up, if level-driven

They promote proactive plays, risking a lot more, since you can still come back quite easily to a respectable 125hp after a skirmish.

Before the minipotions were a thing, skirmishes would seriously hamper your chances at winning the game. If you got hit and ran out of shield pots, you were left at 75 vs the 200hp guys that never fought in the end game.

Slurps and minipotions completely changed the meta of the game, and in my opinion, all for the better. The item feels fair, and it's common enough that usually when finishing a fight you'll be able to loot a few minipots, to replenish your stock.

Now, don't get me wrong, before mini-shields, you might get into a fight with someone who got 2 shield pots and they would wreck you. But now, literally everyone has some amount of shields (basically 25-100) because of how common one of the shield items are. So that means that everyone has extra health and can't be one-shot. Now, if you have a game where there are 2 one-shot weapons (pump-shotguns and bolt-snipers), and make it so that they don't work anymore, you have a problem. It is completely fine for everyone to have a chance to get a shield pot and gain one-shot protection, but now EVERYONE has it. If you're the type of player who likes to sneak up on someone and shotgun people, you can't really do it as effectively. Sure, you can also take an extra hit, but you also loose the satisfaction of getting a one-shot head shot. Out of all the counter arguments that I've heard to my opposition of mini-shields from other people I know, mainly the point is that if everyone has shields, then it's all fair and no one has an advantage. But not only does it make two types of weapon less viable, but it also makes all combat boring, after all even if someone gets a good head shot with their rifle, it'll do about half of their health and they'll pop 2 mini shields and completely negate it. All I ask for is that you don't get 3 mini shields, it's ridiculous. Make it only drop as a single one, after all it's quite similar to slurp juice and in a lot of situations slurp juice only counts as an extra 25 shield. So making only 1 mini shield drop at a time means that getting one doesn't have the same effect as a regular shield potion (plus you have one spare in your inventory) at least in the early game. But for me personally, I'm fed up of hitting an enemy six times with an assault rifle and seeing blue numbers, only for them to turn around and kill me easily because I lost my shield in the last gunfight.

The way you earn medals to upgrade the tier of your Battle Pass is pretty straight forward, but depends heavily on the daily objectives. I think anyone who bought the Battle Pass has bought it with the intend to get it to tier 70 and get all the rewards. 

This requires you to play the game a lot, which isn't bad since you should put some work and time in, which is fine. But what really bothers me is that the extra daily objective you get with the Battle Pass **HAS** to be completed within 24 hours. You can complete it after 24 hours, but that means you won't get a new one on the day you complete it. 

Especially during the holidays, people don't have the time to play the game every day, and it kind of saddens me that there are some kids playing the game on Christmas to get the daily objectives since it feels like you might regret not doing them.

IMO Epic Games should let you stack atleast 2 Battle Pass daily objectives. We all know you need to play Fortnite + complete the daily objectives almost everyday to get Tier 70. And yes, I know you don't **HAVE** to get Tier 70, but everyone wants it. I now sometimes play against my will just to get to Tier 70, making it more of a grind instead of a fun experience.

Please let me know what you think about this. All opinions are welcome and I'd love to hear difference insights aswell.",FortNiteBR

My name is ""Dave"", ingame known as ""Citydriver"" im peaking at a 42% Winrate with an 8+ KD over the course of 600+ Squad games and a total of 1k games. I'd call myself a veteran player which is the reason i think i can state my opinion on the game and certain mechanics/items in the game_

-------------------------------
I've played around 100~ games since the boogie bomb was implemented and my team and i have been hit by 2 (!) of them in total. None of these 2 hits resulted in a death. Most people will call all 4 of us lucky. but is it really lucky if you kill 15~ players average per match over the course of 100 games equaliing 1500 kills, that 1500 players do not manage to hit more than 2 boogie bombs? I would say no.

_Now let's talk about what is happening with the Boogie bomb_

------------------------
The reasons people feel like the Boogie bomb is overpowered:

*  Its a new item, people don't know how to deal with it / play around it 

* Everything new and viable seems LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE at first, if you have ever played league of legends and been around at their subreddit, literally anything Riot does, whenever they bring out a new champion or buff anything at the slightest the whole community starts ranting about ""HOW OP"" it is, one week later no one is even mentioning it anymore because they all realised its just a new thing and they were overwhelmed by it.

* Players are still really bad at the game, the came ""just"" came out and when im lurking around Discords or Teamspeaks all i see is 1-2 KD players with a maximum of a 10% winrate. Players still need to learn this game and don't know how to play it properly, they don't build, they don't aim properly, they don't gather materials, they just don't do basic stuff that helps them win. If you're losing 90% of your games anyway, why do you call the Boogie bomb **OP** if it kills you (it doesnt even kill you, its your bad movement, lack of cover, bad awarness which killed you to begin with) but if the Legendary scar 3 taps you,it's completely fine?

_Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about why the boogie bomb should stay the way it is and how to not die to it._

------------------

* So how do you not die to the boogie bomb? First off the boogie bomb has a quiet small AOE radius, you have to almost get hit in the face to start dancing, making it an item that can be super easily dodged, there is always a chance your opponent has a boogie bomb, so what do you do to not get hit by something? exactly, you build cover, mostly thats enough to not get hit by a boogie bomb. Have you ever seen a grenade being thrown ** right inside your 1x1 Tower?** probably not. They mostly land somewhere behind, in front, below, above, your tower. 

* Start pressuring your opponents: if you give them 10 seconds of freetime, they eventually will pull and remind themselves of the boogie bomb in their inventory, holding LMB to aim it very carefully and throw them at you, shoot at them, build towards them, get high ground, there is *SO MANY* things to prevent getting hit by the bomb just by pressuring the enemy.

* Okay i got _unlucky_ and got hit, what do i do? The same shit you would do if you didnt get hit by it but you're out of materials, you show your movement! Bloom is a thing and people are bad at aiming, cover is everywhere anyway. You can still crouch, jump, and move. Do all 3 of these things combined and if your enemy doesnt run an 8KD you have a good chance of surviving. If there is cover around even better, run circles around a tree, hide behind your already build wall, run around the dusty depots.

--------------------

Summary: **The Boogie bomb is a high skill, high reward item. It's hard to hit due to its direct impact yet rewarding to run infront of your dancing enemies Dabbing in their faces. If you hit a Boogie bomb by getting high ground, throwing it super long range in their face, you deserve getting that kill, its like hitting a grenade in their face, it would also kill them 80% of the time. Keep the Boogie bomb as it is, i would greatly appreciate it!**",FortNiteBR

* place in top 12 teams in squad mode 5 times

* place in top 6 teams in squade mode once

* place in top 50 solo mode 5 times

* place in top 25 solo mode once

By no means (and I truly mean it) are those missions difficult. They are simply tedious. Especially the 5x ones. They just take too much time for how little they reward.

Compare those challenges to something like:

* outlive 150 or 300 opponents

* open 7 ammo boxes

* open 10~ chests

* kill 10~opponents

Those are ones you do by just playing. They flow perfectly with the line of how one plays this game (unless you are bush wookie). You do them just by playing. 

The mode-specific quests however require from player to force them out from the mode they enjoy or even want to play.

Now. While I was writing this I'm finishing my battle pass daily (place in top 12 teams in squad mode 5 times), by simply solo-AFKing in the very middle of the first circle on some tree. I know some might hate me for ""not playing the game"", but I play squads only with my RL friends. I tried fills or discord, but those just end up being tiresome and mentally exhuasting. So here I am, having to wait 50-60 minutes untill daily is completed. Sorry if that offends anyone ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

EDIT: I know about 1 challenge reroll per day. Sadly, I used it up :(

---

I'm no game designer expert, nor any expert on the matter of daily challenges, but I'd love to see those dailies looked at and hopefully changed. Or just give us 1-2 more challenge rerolls per day :)

---

P.S

It's kind of shame 50v50 mode doesn't register as squad games. 

P.P.S

While doing my ""afk-daily"" I noticed at least 5 to 8 players in each game that also afk'd. Tbh I know why. Just by afk surviving for as long as you can (which takes approximately 2 minutes to setup + loading) you get about 300-350 exp. That is quite alot.

And even though I am only an average player at best I oftentimes find myself thinking about cool Legendary/unique items they could add.  I know a lot of people hate the bush disguise but I think it's GENIUS.  Props to Epic for that one. 

Recently they added the Boogie Grenade, which IMO is the worst item introduced yet.  Which is cool. The best way to learn is to make mistakes.  I would rather Epic try out as many ideas as possible and see what sticks then rigorously testing everything internally and not letting the players get in on the fun.  

So even when they get it wrong it's for reasons that are good.  I foresee this game going very far. 

Anywho - here are some ideas for items I would love to see:


- Treasure chest sound and glow mimicking device.  It would be a rare item that you can stick to a wall that will produce the glow and sound of a chest.  You could use it to bait enemies into traps or just into prime positions to get the jump on them.  

- Running shoes.  They would increase your movement speed by 10% for a limited amount of time.  

- Binoculars. Pretty self explanatory. 

- Explosives. You would get 1 sticky bomb you can throw to stick to anything.  (Like Junkrat's from Overwatch)  After placed the same slot would then become a detonator device you can activate at your leisure.  

- A legendary backpack that when used increases your inventory space by 1.  Can only be activated once per game so if you find another by chance you wont be able to activate it.

- LEGENDARY pistol.  Please.

1.  Fort Reinforcer:  Attach something to the outside bottom of your base (for balance purposes) that doubles the XP of all Fort walls linked to that reinforcer.  You would have to give a visual cue to all players that said base was being reinforced, but it would totally change the way people approach.

2.  Infared Camera:  Take a picture to see all players hiding behind walls, forts, bushes, trees etc...  Can not reveal players behind hills/mountains.  

3.  Mind control dart gun.  Shoot an enemy with a sniper shot.  Does no damage but lets attacking player control defending player for 10 seconds.  Attacking player is immobile/vulnerable during this time.

The combination of everything mentioned below feels satisfying and drastically improves your chances of having an easy win.   


In no specific order: 

- Call outs 

- Sharing weapons/shields/med/amo 

- Building 

- Covering fire and flanking 

- Reviving and cover 

- Timing your shooting with your partners

- Landing coordination 

- Overall road map / movement discussion

When I first started reading posts I hadn’t seen it yet and the way the community talked about it made it seem like you were completely immobilized while you danced and I thought, “wow that’s really overpowered.” But upon playing the game I saw you could run around. They also only drop in stacks of 1.

What I think happened is a few people got salty after they got killed by it and came here to call for it to be removed. Now I love constructive criticism, but this community reaction was a complete kneejerk and wasn’t well thought through. The boogie bomb is definitely strong, but it is in no way game breaking and if we freak out every time we feel something is too powerful and call for its removal from the game entirely we are going to create a toxic environment.

Some of the suggestions I saw for the BB that I felt were great were:

•Stop dancing upon damage

•Dancing lasts 5 seconds as opposed to 10

•BB’s don’t explode on impact and bounce

Overall I think we’re still doing a great job being constructive in our criticisms and I have massive respect towards the devs for taking risks and continuously adding new and unique items to FortNite Battle Royale!

I'm not asking they remove them, but there is no need to have two quests forcing you to play squads AND place really high at the same time. Plenty of people prefer playing solo and/or aren't good enough to get that far doing solo squads.

The problem with having two, is that by abandoning one of them, there still is a chance you get the other one, and as a matter of fact it's been happening to me for the last 4 days: I abandon the ""Place Top 6"", only to get ""Place Top 12"" and vice versa, for FOUR days.

Either remove one of them, or change the Place Top 6 (since it's the hardest) to something like ""Play Squads mode X amount of times"" or whatever.

People wonder why I'd rather earn lootboxes by leveling up and have an option to buy specific items if I so choose to or extra loot crates.

I want to spend money on the game, I really do. I just find the current system outrageous. Even battlepass is annoying to me because there's no guarantee I'll be able to unlock everything, and I absolutely can't unlock everything and retroactively purchase the battlepass near the end of the season because it's dependent on the boosts you unlock via the battlepass. The free tier feels like a joke, I mean the first unlock is an LOL emoji and there's only one skin (for your glider) that unlocks at tier 35 which I'd like to see someone get to without buying battlepass and then there's nothing after that.

I know it's all cosmetics and I don't have to buy them which I'm not but I would spend money if it were reasonable. I'd spend more than the $0 I'm spending now. I'd pay the price of a coffee for a single skin. I'd pay $10 for 20 loot boxes. Etc. That would add up and they'd make much more money from more people like me spending money than they make from the few people buying v-coins currently.

Speaking of V-coins are we ever going to be able to unlock them from playing pvp? Why aren't more things tied to player level? Why does this star system with tiers even exist? 

If you can't get to Tier 70 without buying battlepass why on earth not just make the rewards level based and from level 1-100? People will purchase the battlepass to get the rewards. You get the exact same outcome. Without insane grind that could result in a player being exhausted and no longer wanting to play the game anymore when it's all said and done. 

The only explanation for this tier thing is that they have no intention of most players actually earning the rewards and they want the money without having to actually give the content. Watch all of us who can't hit tier 70 conveniently see rewards we missed out on advertised to us for the price of $24.99 (because that's the next option after 1000 coins which most of the skins seem to be over). I pay for battlepass expecting to have a cool black knight skin and end up having to buy it with more money and the coins I earned through battlepass that are now pointless as I've used them to purchase something I was hoping to get with the battlepass to begin with.

Why wouldn't Battlepass just be rewards you get for leveling 1-100? Why the tiers? Why the grind?

Is there another game out there where you pay for the privilege of having to grind for 150 hours to potentially get rewards if you don't run out of time? I haven't played such a game. Every other game with this model has content you buy. You pay for it you get it. Not you pay for it and have to play for three hours a day minimum to unlock it. At which point you'll hate yourself and the game. It's just baffling to me. V-coins in themselves are insulting as well because the only reason it would be justified to sell you v-coin bundles instead of just charging you money per item you purchase (i.e charge  $7.99 for the skin, not 800 v-coins) would be if you regularly earned vcoins from leveling up. Currently you only earn significant vcoins from playing save the world.... the mode you have to have purchased. So you're not actually earning anything. You paid for it. You purchased the game. 

That's the worst thing about this, the people who are spending the most money on cosmetics right now justifying it by ""hey this could be a game you had to buy for $20-40!"" likely did just that by buying the full game as early access. So since you bought the game for the price of a game why are you still perfectly fine needing to pay $35 for a character skin and axe skin combination? That's the price you paid for the game!",FortNiteBR

The BB is OP. Yep. 10s of uselessness on an impact grenade is a free kill. Many people are calling for its instant removal but that’s not what it needs, if it is tweaked to a more balanced state, it can actually be a really enjoyable item. 

Here are a list of changes I feel can balance the BB. **Obviously not every change should be applied but one or two would work.**

- Dance time reduced to 4s

- Rarity increase (Rare/Epic)

- Make the grenade bounce, impact is too easy to hit

- Make dancing stop after damage is applied 

- Reduce blast radius of the BB

- Give victim a damage resistance to give them a chance at survival

- Give victim a speed boost to allow them to have a chance at escape

- If the person who throws the BB is affected by it as well as the enemy, he should have a longer dance timer than the enemy to punish bad throws

That’s all I have at the moment, if anyone has any other suggestions feel free to let me know!

This would nerf it but also add more uses to it.  If you boogie bomb someone they can’t fight back but they are now significantly harder to hit and if you happen to do it in an open area they can now easily run away.   You could also bomb yourself for the movement speed boost in case your caught in a storm or attempting to storm an enemy base from across the field.   ,FortNiteBR

-Uncommon rarity 

-Silences you &amp; gives away location for 10 whole seconds. More than enough to kill an entire squad for something unpreventable.

-Explodes on contact which gives no warning to players, something crucial to a grenade of this power.

How could anyone think this is a good idea? I think it would be overpowering even if it was legendary. At the very least make it 3-4 seconds and not explode on contact, I bet that would make it a fair weapon.

If they think this was a good idea then what else will they add?

Look at how other games handle flashbangs

-At most 3 seconds of blindness

-gives the player a warning

-does not take control away from player, but rather their vision.

- can be avoided by looking away.

The BoogieBomb's current stats are not even a good idea on paper. You can not counter it, it is a death sentence with no warning.

1. Reduce effect duration down from 10 secs to 3-5 (a must)
2. Decrease drop rate and make purple or gold drop
3. Decrease impact radius
4. Remove impact and make explode like regular nades.
5. Instead of the dink dink sound nades have when thrown and are bouncing, maybe have a song played played while bouncing (like a 4 bar count in) 
6. Have the bomb when thrown remain stationary will the 4 bar count down in is played giving players a chance to run.
7. Remove

I now think it's time that we talk about balance. Yes the dreadful topic of balance. Where Reddit shall butcher me depending on these next points.

**Stacks**: Players are able too carry 10 of these bad boys around... **too many**. 8 or even 6, heck even 7 (not 7 please) stacks imo would be justifiable. The intention too level the playing field would still be existent, whilst it being a little less ridiculous trying too trade vs someone at range. 


**Duration**: The time it takes too drink a mini shield is way too fast, long range fights now feel like who has the biggest stack of mini shields (who can chug the most estus). A simple nerf too the speed at which you consume these, should make them feel less spam-able. Hitting someone for 100 blue damage then them popping into cover for **4 SECONDS!** too then have too pop another 50 blue shields doesn't seem right.

My intention for this post is to create some discussion for how a ranked system could be implemented and some ideas I have about what does work for player growth and continuity of the game. 

Firstly, I am all about the division system such as in League of Legends. In that system I loved to grind and see the ranks I got as a result knowing I was one of the top players in NA. In LoL they had Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Challenger (top 200 in NA). There was also sub-divisions of 5 (silver 5,4,3, etc up to 1 and then you had a placement match as a best of 5 to move up a division and between subdivisions it was a placement match of 3) within each. This system isn't ideal for Fortnite but it gives you an idea of what a good ranked system looks like. 

This ranking system above is successful in my opinion because gave you tangible and visual results when ever you climbed in rank. So all this in mind how can we fit something like this in Fortnite?

My thoughts:

1) Divisions are a good idea!
2) Ranked playlist que is necessary.
3) Matchmaking formula is needed. 
4) Individual playlist ranked for single, duo, and squads needed. 

I have more thoughts but I wanted to get this discussion going because I love fortnite and I want a competitive mode. My friends all do too and the only reason they are playing COD is for ranking system ATM. 
 
Please share your thoughts! 

Please EPIC Senpai notice me!

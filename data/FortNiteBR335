new to reddit but been following this subreddit for a while and usually when there's a bug I see it posted everywhere on this reddit. Now I have made over 8 sniper kills (not sniping downed players or anything, just real snipe kills) and I still have 0/2. 
Now my question was am I really the only one whose sniper kills don't count? Usually I don't care about this, but without getting this challenge I can't complete the blockbuster challenge (since I can't play the last 3 weeks).",FortNiteBR

The trap was a fun and tactical piece of equipment, but now that it only does 75 damage, it will hardly ever kill people, because it's very rare for people to be on or below that amount of health.

Attempt #1: Landed, found chest, guy that landed right in front of me, opened it and wasted me.

Attempt #2: Landed, did not find chest, checked several buildings and could not find one weapon. Slaughtered.

Attempt #3: Landed, did not find chest, found Llama. Llama only had Chug Jug and Shield potions. Again, nothing to defend myself with. 

After these attempts, I finally got the last chest I needed. It wasn't really the fact that there were so many other people that fucked me. It was the fact that the weapon spawns were crazy for me today. Couldn't find a gun for shit, but I found plenty of bandages and shield potions. Even a fucking Llama didn't give me a gun.

Aside from creating the Epic Games account using my XBL email address, and a completely different username, I haven't done anything with that account (no PC cross-play or other direct purchases).

For me i can barely handle my frustration after literally dieing 5+  times in a row at the start of the game just because I did not find a shotgun or I die because my pump only hits for 8 dmg on 1m distance cause the spread is fucked.

I mean ofc its a BR so you shouldnt expect to win or even reach endgame in every lobby that you join but i feel like sometimes im just not getting outskilled instead im getting ""outlucked"" so many times in a row that it kills of my joy and motivation to join that 6th attempt getting a decent game done.

One day I get 4 wins the other I play 20+ games and just get cucked and some of them dont even give me a real chance of actually doing smth about it.

(And yes ofc ik that there is almost always a way to outskill but lets be realistc, most of us arent ninja or myth or whoever u admire. 
Dont hit me with em ""get gud""s cuz shit gets old and thats not what I am here for)

well feel free to leave thoughts and comments and share how u handle frustration",FortNiteBR

My son, 11, has been begging his mom and I to let him play FortNite, a lot of his friends play already. Most of them are on mobile I think. We’re not totally against the idea, we just want to make sure he won’t be exposed to a ton of really toxic behavior if we do let him play.

I would like serious responses from other adult gamers. Would/do you let your kids play this game? I’m most worried about offensive chat from other players. I’ve had to have conversations with him about things he has encountered in other games from other players.

I posted the survey here a few days ago, so if you have already taken the survey rest assured your entry is still there and you do not need to fill it out again. 

This survey is based on your satisfaction with Fortnite in numerous ways from balance, cosmetics, modes and much more. The data from everyone's responses will be posted here to the subreddit. You do not have to answer every single question also! The survey is completely anonymous and will show us some really informative insight into the community and how we all feel about certain topics within Fortnite. With this data we can hope to see some good changes within Fortnite as well. I had done this sort of survey previously within the Smite community and actually was able to get in contact with the community team there to relay the information and we actually were able to see some changes the community had been hoping for. We are currently at nearly 1000 entries for the survey so we should have a good chunk of data to analyze and post but I’m hoping we can get some more in here for I start tomorrow! 

Also, as a big thank you to everyone for helping out I will be doing a V Bucks giveaway. There will be a question to type in your Reddit username or your email address so that you can be entered to win. The link is below and thank you everyone for your help!

This is especially bad when the enemies go for you during team fights when downed instead of fighting your friends.

My idea: Give downed players 5-15 seconds of immunity (not really sure how much would be healthy, so I'm giving a range). This way, if your friends are nearby, they have a small amount of time to rush and save you.

You could say: ""But that would be unfair since downed players could make callouts to their friends"". To solve this, they could implement a feature that if you go to a downed enemy and click 'E', you blindfold them and they are unable to see anything until revived.

Getting that Victory Royale loses its special feeling after awhile and there’s nothing left to grind for with the exception of battle pass tiers, however that’s hardly a grind. So I suggest adding a currency that you receive after each win. This has probably been suggested before but haven’t been active on this sub. After let’s say 50 wins you would accumulate enough currency to buy you choice of skin, pickaxe, or dance. These SHOULD NOT  be available to purchase through VBucks. They should symbolize and show the enemy and your squad that you have an achievement you worked for, not bought. After maybe 100, then 500 wins you could unlock your choice of cooler/rarer skins and cosmetics. The number of wins is just a quick example, that could be changed. Adding this currency would provide a greater goal to grind towards after the game becomes more repetitive.

TLDR; Getting a win loses its specialness after awhile, add currency you get after each win that, after getting say 50,100,500 wins you unlock cool cosmetics.",FortNiteBR

294,Crash_t18,1526415546,8josxf,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8josxf/epic_games_must_take_a_decision/,1,Epic Games MUST take a decision.,"With the 3.5 patch last month Epic Games introduced ""a short equip time"" for shotguns saying that ""this will reduce the effectiveness of quickly switching between weapons for high burst\-damage."".

Basically they introduced weapon delay with the intent of nerfing double\-pump and EVERYONE just freaked out because weapon delay is honestly SHIT.

I can't remember a single streamer/pro/reddit user saying that this weapon delay was a good choice to implement in the game, but the game is directed by Epic Games, and we must accept it and adapt to their changes.

I agree and I've adapted to this new gameplay even if I still think it's a bad solution.

So, it's one month later now and what is changed? NOTHING.

Everyone is still using double\-pump, streamers are using it \(Dakotaz, Daequan, Myth, ecc..\), players are using it.

My question is: if you implemented weapon delay with the idea of stopping double\-pump \(basically slowing everyone's gameplay, even who wasn't using double\-pump\) and it turned out it still works perfectly fine, can we please think about another solution and just remove weapon delay from the game? Is it gonna stay as it is right now? Do you guys think it's fine? Are Epic Games thinking about a new way to nerf double pump or we just need to accept this mechanic AND the downside they added about it?

P.S.: i do not hate double pump, i didn't use it, i'm not using it, i don't care if anyone is using it. I would just like to know what is the direction of this game. I'm sorry if i made any mistakes in my post, english is not my first language.",FortNiteBR

How do you get the high ground in this situation?  
I think that ramping up to the side with 2 ramps(1 to go up and the other 1 to not get shot in the back) wouldn't be good against a decent player since he would just shoot your ramps down before you could reach him.  

I find myself in this situation too often, and I survive only a small percentage of the time, so I would really love to discuss some strategies, thanks :D.",FortNiteBR

It would be a duos tournament and would cost £10 per team to enter with the winner receiving a cash prize, which will depend on the amount of interest i receive for this event.

I don't care about PC crossplay, but I'm sick of these try hards (of which always seem to be using the bright bomber skin, for whatever reason) exploiting the playerbase for cheap kills.

It's becoming so common now that endgame has players blatantly  flick shooting and dropping an entire box around themselves with one button press.

Also, for the inevitable jerks coming over only to say ""get gud"", it's not a case of that, you idiots, of course it's doable to best KBM users, but it's just like having controller support for mobile.

Tight frame skips from time to time and it's been really bugging me. I have great internet and literally have no connections issues anywhere else or even on any other online game.

In the beginning I thought it was my internet, I even went out and purchased a new router specialized for gaming costing over $250 thinking it would help. It didn't, right there I knew it couldn't be my internet.

I researched all over to figure out what can be causing this and it hit me I started really getting frame skips around the time replay mode was added.

This is what I did.. I disabled game recording throught the fortnite menu and went into my PS4's gallery for saved video clips and found out I had over 250GBs of fortnite videos saved.. I deleted a whole months worth of clips and dropped it down to about 50gbs.

When I say the difference is night and day guys, I promise you it is. My colours on the game look crisper, when I land I don't lag, when I swing my axe at a tree there's no frame skipping... I have literally ZERO frame issues. I can't believe it.

If there's any other (preferably PS4 users) console players who are lagging please try this method and post below if it worked for you... This might be the fix... Replay mode might be causing issues. Please let us know if you try this out!

TLDR: Frame issues may be caused my replay mode and videos stored on your console. My fix was to disable replay mode and delete a lot of useless videos from my console which stopped my lagging completely.",FortNiteBR

The spread at range is far to good for a shotgun. People are picking me off with 25\-50 damage and sometimes 100 from across the street.  This accounts for pump and tac. Theres times where we get snook up on and instead of using SMG's/Pistols people would rather use shotguns, when someone is taking 25\-50 damage from you when you dont have shield from across the street, you're already at a disadvantage.

I dont think pump or tac shotguns should do any more than 145 damage. Theres nothing worse than picking someone off with a rifle then going in to finish them with 100 health and shield only to get 1 tapped. It's just not fair, especially when i hit them for a 9 when they are on 45 HP.

Make pump shotgun and tac spread wider at longer ranges and lower damage to 2 hits for a kill instead of 200\-0.

But I own both consoles, and I currently play Fortnite on PS4.

I know the Xbox One can upscale to 4k, but I don't think Fortnite supports 4k on consoles?

So my question is, does fortnite play/look/feel any better on the xbox one s?

If not, I'll stick with my PS4 (it's not a ps4 pro).

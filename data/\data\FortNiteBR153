I know that epic doesn‚Äôt owe anyone anything. But the key to success in a competitive market is keeping consumers happy. They did a good job with the purple skull trooper, but I think it could be executed better. Give every re-released Christmas skin TWO backblings, one that comes with this years Christmas and one that comes with last years. This could apply to every Christmas skin. ",FortNiteBR

I really don't wanna spend my entire weekend doing this. What would be the best game modes to do my remaining challenges:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Finish 3 vehicle timed trials:*** This is the one I desperately need to know because it's the hardest one on my plate. Obviously, the hardest part is actually finding a Quadcrasher. I was doing this on Team Rumble, but here's the thing: the storm is coming so you may not get a vehicle on time, and even if you do get one, what if you get killed? You will respawn,  but you probably lost your vehicle at that point. You may say ""just get another one!"", but at that point the circle is probably so small you can't get anymore! Besides, in this game mode, people are probably taking all the quadcrashers, or maybe I'm just really unlucky? If anyone has tips for me on this, please let me know!
2. **Score of 3+ at different Shooting Galleries**
3. **Speed of 27 or more on different Radar signs**
4. **Jump through flaming hoops**
5. **Eliminate Opponents in Pleasant Park**
6. **Visit Junk Junction and Pleasant Park in a single match**
7. **Dance with a fish trophy**
8. **Score of 3 on different Clay Pigeon Shooters**
9. **Visit a camel and crashed battle bus (already visited viking ship)**

In their justification for cross-platform tournaments, EPIC essentially said ""bUt NiCkMeRcS aNd AyDaN,"" but both of these players have since started playing with a controller on PC due to the obvious and substantial advantages. Before people reply saying ""but console players have been claiming to be equal to PC for ages,"" these are the players with fragile egos who can't stand to admit that PC is superior.

Maybe Season 7 can come out with the S2 BP and let you finish off where you left off last year/ buy the s2 bp?,"Its that time of year again! Its almost a year since the first battle pass released! Lots of people didnt get to finish the s2 BP before it rotated out in late January, so maybe bring it back so we can, (along w/ s7 bp) and allow others to purchase the s2 BP! I got half way through and didn‚Äôt have enough time to finish it, and I missed out on nice cosmetics (sparkle, acdc, royale x, BLACK KNIGHTT). Riding off of that, previous owners of the s2 bp could get 30 addtional tiers (2new tier 100 skins, one s2 and one s7) if they didnt finish it. To make it even more fair, reduce the amount of time that people have to finish the new S2 battle pass to about a month and a half. 

I wouldn‚Äôt suggest the s1 season shop since that was a **shop** and not really a battle pass.

The S.C.A.R. totally beats the Suppressed S.C.A.R. in every way. For one, the bloom on the Suppressed is much more then the normal one. The normal has more base damage also. The description when it was coming out was something along the lines of rewarding tap firing. The blue Assualt Rifle and it are practically the same except for sound, so I believe it needs to be buffed.

We could either bring the S.C.A.R. to 34/35, which would not be a big Nerf, and bring the Suppressed one to 35/36. That would make the weapon more viable and more people using it.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen anyone do the math yet so I thought I'd oblige. The blizzard appears to be getting physically closer, but I'd like to quantify that. Today I went to three points on the map to get compass bearings for the blizzard (details below) and cranked out the math to find exactly where the blizzard is right now. The above link gives an illustration for my result: compared to the bottom left corner of the map, the blizzard is about one-and-a-half map lengths West and four-and-a-half map lengths South. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to redo these later as the blizzard appears to get closer. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Details**:

&amp;#x200B;

I identify each map point by the name of the square to the point's Southeast, e.g. the point exactly in the middle of the squares G8, H8, G9, H9 would just be called H9.

&amp;#x200B;

There is one prominent peak in the middle of the blizzard that was used to take the bearings.

&amp;#x200B;

My three points and bearings were A7 (bearing 196¬∞), D10 (bearing 201¬∞), and J11 (bearing 209¬∞). 

&amp;#x200B;

I defined my coordinate grid by map squares with the origin in the bottom left corner, e.g. D10 is at (3,1) and A7 is at (0,4). From there it's just finding the slopes and solving for the intersection of the lines. I used two pairs of points for two separate calculations. The first calculation (the more accurate) was found by using the data from A7 and J11, yielding the blizzard coordinates as (-14.2, -45.4). A second calculation between D10 and J11 was used to verify, yielding (-13.8,-44.7). So the blizzard appears to be right around (-14, -45), or compared to the lower left corner of the map, the blizzard is 14 squares West and 45 squares South.",FortNiteBR

like wtf? If you dont play the game to win, why do you even play? It's a battle royale, the main objective is to win. Also, in Fortnite, people like to get as many kills as possible. ""Sweating"" is fine, you're just bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people have a dream to be the best in the game. They won't reach that goal by hiding in a bush waiting for it to be 1v1 for the win, they attack and get better  at the game, so they can compete against better players. 

&amp;#x200B;

So drop the ""sweaty"" talk, being a sweat is the objective of the damn game. If you call someone a sweat, I automatically think of you as a noob, who can't play the game.

I've thought of a concept called ""Taser Gun/Electric Gun""

So what it basically does is, when you shoot at an enemy he gets tasered.

When the bullet hits him it does 40 Body damage 90 Head, but it does -5 to 7 damage every second for 5seconds max.

The enemy is not able to shoot he can only run away it's for a time of 5 seconds epic can also nerf the gun if it's way to OVERPOWERED.

Here is some info:

* New Epic and Legendary Electric Gun  

   * 40 / 50 maximum damage
   * Available from floor loot, chests, Supply Drops, and Vending Machines.
   * Damages enemy for 5 seconds after he gets hit. For 5 damage on body &amp; 7 on head.
   * They should make it like grappler so max 5 bullets and then the weapon breaks.

Tell me what you think about it...!

Hey (forgot to add flair so i reuploaded)

https://i.redd.it/xmamdapren121.png

https://i.redd.it/s56sv6oren121.png

Ive joined this subredit few months ago, and been looking at quite some suggestions. I work at sketchup (sorry for not using some more advanced program..) from time to time and I know this idea was brought up few times , but last week i was trying to make my own version of what i think is cool design for it...

Let me just say that ive never tried to design any kind of weapon or trap like this..

Sentry guns in games are most of the time OP so thats why my idea of it would be to make it do/have:

* Burst firing (dealing 8-15 damage max for 1 burst)
* 80hp so it wouldnt be problem to shoot it down
* make it noisy so its easy to spot
* Ive put small Battery and temperature icons on front , so people can see how overheated or how much power does it have left
* You would be able to place it only on floor (not stairs or pyramids).
* 3 buttons on the front would indicate 3 things, if its firing , overheated or looking for target.
* aaand i had no clue about shooting range..

So as i said this is just concept and really just vision in my head , ***so I wanted to know if youd like me to continue on desiging it and texturing it. If you have any suggestions id love to hear them i am capeable to design anything .. :P***

and yea.. Thank you for taking your time reading this..",FortNiteBR

If not I'll just walk to their headquarters and  ask the simple question. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THIS GAME??

&amp;#x200B;

Okay let me go in:

&amp;#x200B;

Game Completely Freezes

Biggest issue  I have hear other having is the game, for no apparent reason, will completely freeze or lock up. This is not the server catching up or trying to reconnect. Everyone I have talked to about it says the same thing. The entire game freezes anywhere from 5 -15 seconds. I have had it happen to my self and a teammate in both duos and squads they can still talk they can still communicate be there is absolutely zero response from any kind of input from the game. Now seeing it when it  happened to friends they just stop moving.

&amp;#x200B;

Reaction time of Building

I' m not a pro builder and can EASILY be out built by some one who has been practicing their building everyday but I would say I'm average. However I can do anything to stop the current turret problem if there is going to be latency in the builds. I know we have ALL been there just trying to figure out why TURBO build literally it job is to just build whatever is currently selected if the action button you have set to build is pressed. TIME and TIME again I will be switching to say ramp and don't want it to build 20 ft in front of me so I look down press my key bind for ramp then hold down my action button for placing the ramp ( left mouse button) nothing. I have to click some time twice for it to respond. My teammates complain about the same issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Vanishing Cubes

Since the new shotgun update was release the issue where players stay invisible as still able to shoot you is currently happening. This was an issue not that many updates ago why are we seeing it again??

&amp;#x200B;

Serves in General

I am constantly hearing about the issues with server ALL OVER THE PLACE. You got ppl playing on east coast servers bc of how bad west coast servers are. MY average pin Season 1-5(ish) was always 10-21. Since season 6 is an average of 55-85. Granite I allowed this issues when we had the zombies everywhere figured it would cause such issues BUT COME ON!!

&amp;#x200B;

Epic you have a game that MILLIONS of people play a day,  you have raked in huge amounts of Revenue from this game on micro transactions alone. You're telling me your teams cant fixes these issues? You keep adding content that doesn't really keep the audience happy it just mildly distract for a week or so and turn around to hearing the same complaints.  I want to love the game I want to play more with friends, but as my now uninstalled friends have stated, some times you just have to stop playing a game when a company only cares about the revenue and not the players experience. You want to truly make people happy fix the servers, fixed the bugs  that were fixed already, stop adding random LTM and focus on the actual quality of each game someone jumps into. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are at least two more bugs I have hear from others but these three are the most common ones I hear. ",FortNiteBR

It used to be a struggle to secure just one random house in the middle of nowhere. Every game, as soon as you landed, you were pretty much guaranteed with an intense battle to claim the house with the chest in etc.

But since they added Titled Towers, I feel like the map has become COMPLETELY unbalanced. Especially since they increased the loot there drastically. 

Now you have at *least* 30 players dropping at Tilted Towers each game, and the rest of the map? Just boring and stale. You land somewhere, spend 5 minutes getting a somewhat okay load out, spend bloody 20 minutes trying to find *someone* to kill, and then boom, you eventually die to some dude with a rocket launcher and that stupid turret thing and get mowed down in 10 seconds.

TLDR: I think Epic should remove or replace tilted towers because it makes the map extremely unbalanced; most parts of the map are extremely boring because of the sheer number of people that drop there.

We all understand that to prevent double pumping or heavies, something had to be done unless letting players carry only one shotgun. However, simply putting a delay, was not so wise a decision for gaming experience.

Double shotguns take up 2 slots, and can‚Äôt break structures unlike previous seasons. Some might argue that it requires skills which casuals couldn‚Äôt attempt, but if double pumping is not the meta as it‚Äôs not the strongest, it won‚Äôt actually matter.

With reasonable amount of pullout delay, it is time for double pump to come back in the game. At least it is better than a blue weapon insta killing somebody. Early games now are as if RPGs are all around the places.",FortNiteBR

Shotguns are OP now. why can't the fortnite kids just get over that their OP meta was taken away from them. One pump is broken and now you dont even have to hit shots to do damage. First you complained about SMGs being OP. Which they were, but COME ON. One shot death is broken. The no skill third parties literally destroy now. Come on epic...do something about this.

I agree shotguns needed a buff. BUT BLUE PUMPS SHOULD NOT HIT FOR 200 TO THE HEAD. Only the legendary pump should. Early game is either to easy or too hard.

I expect this post to get hate from ""wE waNT SeAson 2"" but I don't care. I'm just expressing my point, if you disagree tell me why. I want to hear opinions to fix the broken game.",FortNiteBR

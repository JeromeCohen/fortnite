Im not here to complain, but discuss.","So today I got perma banned from Atlantis. Why? First, I got a 3 day ban right as the weekend started last week, for griefing someone. Even though I killed them OFF SPAWN. I argued with a mod from atlantis discord, trying to let him see trough Atlantis biased and unclear rules.  


Later in the week I got killed by a Pro in a really similar situation, and I messaged the mod asking if he wanted evidence, or if their rules were going to stay biased.  


I did not break a single rule ever, and today I get a message saying:  You were banned from Atlantis Scrims NA, Kept on following me arround reddit on both official and non official account. Kept spamming me for days and tried to lie himself back into the server.  


First of all, I only sent a message on the day I was UNFAIRLY banned from the server and the day I was GRIEFED. I never sent any messages to any other accounts. I don't know what that is about, and I really encourage you /u/manere to show the evidence. And I never tried to lie myself into the server, I clearly gave you evidence, showing that I killed a team that landed on my spawn.  


It is really sad that the only way to get practice is in 1 discord server, that is not officially ran by Epic. Where you can get banned for not being liked by the mods, and where you are pretty much untouchable if you are a Pro. I NEVER broke a rule, and now I am banned forever.

It’s a weapon many, including myself, would choose over the pump yet almost nobody would choose a tac or heavy over it or a pump. Leave these two in the vault and bring back the pump, also increasing the spawn rates of the combat for balance. Now you have a shotgun meta with two distinctive choices that are equally beneficial depending on your play style. This is the obvious choice but of course epic won’t do this because bots love the tac because of its huge reticle, but if there is a comp loot pool in the future, this would define and fix the shotgun meta for a while, adding variety and choice to weapon loadouts catering to specific needs.",FortniteCompetitive

My idea is to have 1 health every 5 seconds, like a slurp, but it’s infinite.

This way, if you take damage, you’re still punished and are at a disadvantage in the short run if you take damage(as it doesn’t grow back instantly, it would be 10 health per 50 seconds), but you aren’t punished in the long run for not finding shields.

IMO it would prioritize shields first THEN health so it’s a little more balanced.

In short here are the benefits 

Console don’t want pc because of the number of options and the FPS is way higher on PC

Pc doesn’t want console because they no longer have stretched res in competitive ( I think, correct me if I’m wrong)

Mobile/switch want it because all of the above

Put mobile and switch together and pc by them self and console by themself

I’m sure epic has the money to fund these

Or even if it was one week all platforms compete and the next each platform competes by themself (mobile with switch, pc by them self and console by them self) for a third of the usual cash for each division. (Cash could be split unevenly so pc get more as they are the highest rated players and mobile/ switch with the least)

I also think that the age limit for these kind of events should be lowered by 1 or 2 years. Not because I’m to young I’m 13, but because as an oce player I know many people younger than me by a year or 2 that have the same/ better skill level.

It’s big and cumbersome and the large spread makes it seem like you’re trying to kill someone with a fly swatter. My personal take on bringing useful shotguns back is to vault the tac, make the combat shotty a replacement for it, and unfairly either the pump or the heavy and keep the combat shotty at its current rarities.

\* Siphon would have to be in the game, either 50-100 hp/shield on kill. 

\* No fall damage. 

\* Also maybe lower res time to 5 seconds.

Anytime I try to go for an edit shot I always have to take damage. Never have I been able to get off an edit without being shot first and its all because of the annoying circle timer delay. WHY is this mechanic still in the game? It was meant to stop double shotgunning, but theres no need for the mechanic to be active WHEN I ONLY HAVE ONE SHOTGUN. WHY am I being limited for no reason? This mechanic has NO place what so ever in this meta and should NOT be active when you only have 1 shotty.",FortniteCompetitive

•Is the only weapon that can do 100 splash damage with a projectile faster than a sniper bullet

•Reloads quickly and uses shotgun ammo,

Personally, I hate it so much. 

I think the combat shotgun is just **waaaay** too good. at a certain range I'm pretty sure it beats every other weapon basically. People are saying even at close range it now beats SMGs and the Tommy Gun? I'm not sure on that fact but in practice I feel that's 100% true.

One things for sure is that the tac and dualies, probably the only two real other guns you can use in a similar manner in buildfights, (to get chip damage vs builders) are dogshit in comparison. 

But the drop rate of the combat is so stupid, just above 1%. Even though the Pump was OP, at least everyone basically could find one. I wonder what the average number of combat shotty's in each POI is? Can't be that high (my guess is 1 to 2, including vending machines).

I think people have started to learn how to use the Combat shotty, especially the fact it's so good even at further ranges. People thought it was dogshit at first, but obviously the pump is gone, so is it still the best choice? 

I'm okay with the combat being the better shotgun. It's a higher rarity and is tougher to aim with, it should probably be better. But to this extent? My Tac shotgun headshots do less damage than a combat bodyshot will at like a box away. You literally need to be in their box for the tac to even stand a chance, and even then, if they land their shots, you lose. 

What do you guys think?",FortniteCompetitive

No chance of going pro but I do like to compete and improve as much as I can. 

This is my first m&amp;kb shooter and I ended up putting all my build binds, edit and crouch on the g502 which helped take pressure off learning ESDF movement.

I play on a low sens (700dpi x 0.037x/y) and the weight from the g502 was starting to bother my wrist so I bought the glorious model O to help with that. But I am starting to doubt its worth relearning totally new binds. I’m having a very tough time with movement while also hitting all the binds on the keyboard. 

Should I start to slowly switch binds 1 at a time from the g502 until I get used to them on the keyboard then switch to the model O? Learn to play on a higher sens on the g502? Or just switch cold turkey and be a bot for a while?",FortniteCompetitive

Thought I’d share this comp discord. It’s open to anyone who made it to the finals of any weekend of a World Cup qualifier. Getting in is easy, just fill out the google form I’ve put below. The discord was posted on here before by someone else, but didn’t get much visibility. Hoping to get more traction on this post. 

The server has no unrealistic zone rules like Atlantis; I think these customs are the best practice we have so far.

Note: the server is for NAE customs only.

What I want to know is who actually likes this gun and picks it up over literally ANYTHING else. 

We already have 3 sniper classes: Hunting, Suppressed (falls under Bolt action), and Heavy. Does it actually benefit a worse player to have 10 shots, when unlike the suppressed bolt, someone will know exactly where you're shooting from and either just hide or build? The reason they removed the revolver and thermal is because literally NO ONE carried them unless it was for memes. I can't imagine this gun being any different statistically.

It just sucks that there's an option for a gun that's literally terrible at everything it does. If they wanted a more common sniper (scoped, unlike the hunting rifle), bring back the regular bolt action as green/blue and keep the suppressed purple/gold. But even then, you want snipers to he more rare because they are often times seen as an extra item to your inventory.

It would be fine for it to come back for the Sniper only LTMs but besides being terrible even in those, I don't understand it's purpose in the game. Could anyone enlighten me?",FortniteCompetitive

I'm not sure why this sub insists on trying to get stuff added when it is very very clear they have taken on a hard stance on this in particular, and if for some reason you can't get that through your head, posting that some other game has an FOV slider isn't an optimal argument.

Let me start.

Best Season? 

- I think Season 3 was pretty much dope, I am not a big fan of "" variety "" weapons, so all I actually needed was a pump and an AR I guess, or a Deagle, love that thing. Besides, you had to build to win games, and defeat enemies, while nowadays you have to jump into fights and spraypray some people.

- Besides Season 3, I think last Season was also Dope, with Siphon and stuff, really upped my game a lot, became a better player, learned a lot of stuff and game was fun (only bad thing I think is the Blue pump hitting 100 body shots, leaving just landed guys in grave danger if they don't have guns)


Worst Season?


- This season, by far.

- Nothing they added makes sense, and I feel like they are provoking us, a lot.

- Slipstream (across the map), Drone Streams(4,5 on the map), Quads, Ballers, Hoverboards, Shadow Bombs, Gliders, Launchpads, Impulse Grenades..so many mobility options.
Shotguns? Nah, they added one of the worst Shotguns ever, and not by being bad, but by being OP, Combat Shotgun, 10 bullets, 130 is max, 3 shots per 2 secs, nobody even builds after shooting a pump anymore, they just drop down and spam the shit out of you.

- By having Spam Guns (Drum Gun, Tac AR, SMG, Minigun, AR, Tac, Combat Shotgun etc.), and such a huge mobility (said before), you made this game into a 3rd party Festival!

- Not only that, you removed Siphon to encourage players only to wait for 3rd party opportunities, because if Siphon was on, not only would Timmy and his Drummy squad fall back, they would camp and lose because they are not good enough.

- Removing Siphon and adding Spam and Mobility is the reason this Season is the Worst Season ever, not even Planes was that bad. Oh yeah, and removing pumps also.

- Imagine if I would mention the broken audio, broken builds, broken shots etc. Bugs.

When you're in business of any kind, you need to maintain good relationships and a good reputation and anyone can understand that keeping someone trapped in a contract that they are unhappy with will burn bridges and a lawsuit like this one will bring a lot of negative attention on Faze (not to mention airing its dirty laundry). Burning bridges and damaging its reputation will hurt its business and possibly even cause it to shut down. So even if Faze is only thinking of pure self interest it should have never let this get to a lawsuit... And that's not to mention all the legal fees it may incur. Every business depends on relationships, reputation and repeat dealings and that keeps people in check and helps them to resolve disputes relatively amicably. I can't pretend that it won't hurt Faze to lose Tfue.... I'm sure it will. But it won't hurt them nearly as much as the fallout from this lawsuit (regardless of whether they win or lose or settle...it seems to me that they are likely to lose on the Talent Agency Act point but we don't have enough info to determine who is likely to win on the contract point).

Now it does seem possible that Faze did offer a buyout to Tfue which he rejected because he didn't want to pay any money and he chose to sue instead. But that probably doesn't make sense because the legal costs he would incur for the lawsuit would likely be more than whatever the buyout was (although Faze may end up paying those costs if Tfue wins). If Faze indeed offered Tfue a reasonable buyout and Tfue rejected it because he didn't want to pay and then he turned around and sued....well that would change my opinion somewhat (although at the same time I am genuinely concerned about all these kids and young adults signing predatory contracts with these orgs that they don't really understand...we definitely need more regulation in this area).",FortniteCompetitive

I mean, sure, I don't have to take fights and you can play it ""safe"" and ""smart,"" but it doesn't mean that you're not in a very clear and huge disadvantage...

I almost never manage to replace somebody's wall after having them at low hp, because the odds of them having a higher ping than me is so slim that the only time I manage to do that is if the player is completely oblivious and clueless and hasn't tried to hold their wall with a turbo build. If they aren't clueless and are decent players, and I try for too long, I can obviously get punished for that, meaning that the only way to avoid that is literally give up on the kill ,nkowing I will never secure it, and move along. More often than not, securing a kill (when the player is obviously so fuck low) is so huge for the game and can literally change the outcome. It's so frustrating.

Also, if we reverse the scenario, whether I am low or not, whenever a player tries to take my own wall, they more often than not manage to replace it. That means that I always have to resort to turtling away, and it can get so messy and dumb. Sometimes, since their ping is that lower than mine, then they can squeeze in some SMG/Drumgun bullets through my turbo build and finish me off effortlessly, without even having to replace it (sure, I can try to have a doulbe layer of protection, like my wall and inside the 1by1, stand being a ramp or so), but it's not always an option right away).

I'm just wondering at this point if instead of have this constant sense of frustration, I should just not even bother with competitive anymore.

I'm not trying to take anything away from skill and hard work (I would have grinded my heart out if I had the time, but sometimes I simply can't, due to uni and whatnot. I haven;t even participated in the quals yet, was hoping to do it this weekend), but there's a reason some of the best and most consistent players in the world cup have 0-10 ping, and it's not a newsflash to anybody.However, those are factors that can be adjusted and changed. You can get better, you can improve your gameplay, etc, but you can't improve your ping...

Do you even know someone with a relatively high ping make it as far as qualifying? People think that if you place within the top 100 or so, then it shows that you can eventually qualify, but I think that's a far cry. You can get as far as even top 30 by not being greedy, playing smart and playing relatively passive. It doesn't mean that you have the potential to make it to top 8 (EU, for example).",FortniteCompetitive

So, until Epic gives Arena a separate loot pool, I’m just going to relax and just play for fun. And I know that probably sounds like an impossible thing to do. But when you start playing for the plays and less for the kills &amp; wins, it just becomes fun.

Players who do not have to spend time running to the first circle can use that time to loot or farm and will enter the circle stronger. People who are forced to run are also likely to be forced to fight. Even if they win the engagement, it is likely to be a double whammy as they lose HP and expend resources just to get to the first circle.

&amp;#x200B;

With vehicles, players can spread out across the map and use their vehicles to get into position. The game changes dramatically as game sense becomes the dominant factor in determining survival and victory. Being able to move rapidly means that players who can map out a path to the best position on the map that anticipates where other people are going to be will have a decisive advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

While gun and build skills are always going to be important, there is no way you can survive a situation where 5 different players in fortified structures are trying to kill you no matter how good your gun and build skills are. And you are in a position where different parties are trying to kill you because you did not have the game sense to get into a better position.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, an important strategic element is added to the game. You have to think about what you are going to do instead of simply relying on reflexes and muscle memory.

The exception is that explosive weapons are probably too powerful for competitive, but as we understand, Epic takes priority of casual fortnite over competitive fortnite which is understandable and so these special weapons need to be in the base gamemodes. (Maybe remove bow from lootpool and lower max explosive ammo count to 4 in arena)

I think we’re now starting to see how detrimental this idea can actually be. Fortnite will **never** be in a healthy state as long as Epic continues to force their view of the game onto players when there are clear statistics to show how the game is actually being played.

The 26% argument: This is possibly the *dumbest* argument for balance that I’ve ever seen. The problem isn’t the guns, it’s the overall playstyle of the game. It doesn’t mater if we have a pump or not, that fact of the matter is that this is a close quarters game and the best close range weapon will have the highest kill %. The easiest way to explain this would be using a hierarchy. Let’s say the top 4 close range weapons were as follows (kill % of the other weapons are purely estimations and not important).

1. Pump = 26%                 
2. Drum Gun = 12%
3. Smg = 8%
4. Tac shotgun = 4%

Total Close Range Kill Percentage = ~50%

Removing the pump doesn’t magically erase that 26% and somehow make Epic’s long range vision a reality. No. Nothing changes. That 26% is simply dispersed amongst the new top close range weapons. So now it might look something like this:

1. Combat Shotty: 20%
2. Drum Gun: 16%
3. Tac: 7%
4. Smg: 7%

Total = ~50%

I know these numbers are estimations and I don’t have the stats at hand. But I can almost guarantee that this is the case. Just look at your games. Has the game changed at all since the pump removal? It’s still as close quarters (if not more so) than it was before. It doesn’t matter what tools they supply us with, the game revolves around close range combat and always will. They can remove every shotgun in the game and it’ll still be “next man up” with a spray weapon. Epic needs to stop forcing their vision on the game when it’s simply not going to effect anything. Work with us, instead of trying to force us to change.",FortniteCompetitive

I'd consider myself a mid tier player, not overly skilled but I spend a good bit of time on this subreddit and on twitch so I have a decent understanding of the mechanics and strategy of higher level play. I used to get such a rush playing this game, but nothing feels satisfying anymore. I used to love snipers, but then they dumbed them down so that bullet drop barely matters anymore and introduced the heavy sniper so you barely have an incentive to aim for the head. Shotgun fights used to be like an intricate dance between two skilled players, but every shotgun is just a little timmy spam machine now. I can't help but picture Epic devs looking satisfied with themselves watching every fight devolve into a jumping shotgun match between two players screaming ""SMATH THE BUTTON!!!11!"" like Tyrion's retarded cousin smashing beetles. I won't even get started on the abundance of spammy RNG automatic weapons and bullshit like the bow that shouldn't be in the game (or at least relegated to rumble/pubs).

Besides the unsatisfying weapons though, the mechanics of the game make me feel like I'm playing in water. The shotgun delay and FOV have been talked about ad nauseam. But every mechanic feels like it's meant to discourage fighting or good positioning. Just placing building pieces is buggy af right now. The peaking angle from high ground tbh favors low ground warriors and encourages you to drop down for a 50/50 spam off. The fact that three pellets are guaranteed to hit with every shotgun shot blows my mind and pretty much guarantees you'll take damage no matter how good you are at peaking (and I can't count how many times I've killed someone/been killed from about 50 m out with the new combat shotgun since you barely need to aim at a gliding player and you're guaranteed a 10 dmg chip shot with zero bloom).

And I know that most of you are thinking and getting ready to type out ""git gud scrub"" which, fair enough. But I feel like the only way to beat anyone anymore is to grind kovaaks and have better tracking aim in a box since that's how most fights end up anymore. And I have decent enough aim to beat similarly skilled people like that sometimes, but when I do, I feel nothing. No sense of accomplishment or excitement. Just recognition of the fact that my bloom was better. Or that I had more health/shield. Tbh, I've probably been playing better statistically since the little timmy meta was made the only viable option this season. But I just barely have the desire to play. Back when double pump was a thing I was (still am tbh) what many would refer to as a bot. But every time I got bopped by a double-pumping OG John Wick I knew I got outplayed and hopped in the next match hoping I ran into that same Wick and got a chance to redeem myself. And when I did finally bop that Wick back after he killed me 5, 10, 15 games in a row (admittedly it was probably not the same one, but whatever) I felt such a rush of adrenaline and pride in the fact that I had learned from all the mistakes I made and improved.

So before this post turns into even more of a bitch-fest than it already has (sorry for that btw, I just kinda need to vent; I love this game but hate the path it's taken :/ ), I'd just like to get your guys opinions on it. Are you guys having fun anymore? Not in a ""oh shotguns were getting old anyway, It's nice to try something new"" way. But in a get out of your chair, scream half hate/half excitement filed obscenities then apologize to your family and neighbors and explain to them what a ""double pumping John Wick scrub"" is and why he should eat your ass kind of way.",FortniteCompetitive

With the addition of the semi-automatic sniper players can now spam you from close, medium, and long range. The ‘Summer of Spam’ conspiracy is all but officially confirmed. This is further supported by the decreased availability of the combat shotgun which , although a spam weapon in its own right, is being reduced to create more variability in close range combat.

These changes are clearly designed to lower the skill gap by increasing randomness in game. This is supposedly great news for casual players but horrible for any competitive play. I say supposedly because I couldn’t imagine all but the most casual player being content with their entire game experience consisting of mindlessly spraying their gun. 

It goes without saying that competitive games, or any game for that matter, shouldn’t be determined by randomness. If chess required players to reach into a bag and pull out random pieces no one would play. 

This provides further support for separate loot pools, a change that would greatly benefit both competitive and casual gamers. It baffles me why Epic hasn’t already done this.",FortniteCompetitive

Idk about you guys but I was already having problems finding a usable shotgun (aka not the grey tac, I take any spray weapon over that garbage) on the previous patch.

It seems like Epic is really forcing the hand to make shotguns not the centerpoint of their whole game. I just don't understand why though. Shotguns (rip pump) and the trap are the only counter to a spraying wkeyer with a health advantage on you rn in this game... so much for unhealthy aggression HAH!",FortniteCompetitive

While the console layout does need changed, and epic is surely aware of it, there is nothing we can do about it at the moment. With this being said, what are things we can do mechanically as a player to get better at editing right now?

When I edit I always switch back to my gun, instead of staying on the building menu, to avoid having to switch to the right structure to edit. After some practice I realized this takes a ton of unnecessary time, and that getting used to switching to the right structure in the building menu to edit is much quicker.

I used to think building and editing  pyramids/floors above me when ramping up was impossible on console but it's actually pretty easy after learning how to avoid going back to my gun to edit. Being able to do this was eye opening and made me realize editing on console may not actually be too difficult with a lot of practice.

Im not saying all no skins are fake no skins, but im seeing more and more each day. They don't make it subtle either, showing off their purchased emotes, or battle pass ones. This is one of the main things I need to change in my gameplay as of now: Treating no skins as regular players.

My friend was isolated in a teamfight, me and 2 others were focused on the other guys while my friend was by himself and got knocked. I immediately turned around as he was around 5 metres away from us, and spammed the fuck out of my nade launcher at their build fight (too many people insta finish so I wanted to scare him). All of a sudden I see a jonesy emerge as he tried to escape from my spam. I had to reload my launcher so he sorta had the upper hand. But in my head im like 'haha its only a jonesy I can handle him without building'. Pull out my dual pistols and start going to town on this noob... He then sprays the fuck out of me with his p90 as I watch my 150 health insta drop to 0. That was so frustrating because he got a good amount of headshots on me, so I really doubt it was an actual default skin with no money spent on the game. I average 3-5 kills per squad game by the way, so I'd like to think im better than the average player, and able to efficiently dispose of the under average no skins. But a lot of these fake ones are probably on my level or better, so I really do need to be cautious.

Thanks for reading and I hope someone benefited from this piece of advice, albeit a pretty bog standard one.

Fortnite has shared that they are going to be giving away 100 million in prize money for the 2018-2019 season, which could mean if divided almost equally(as the world championship would have a larger prize pool in comparison to the other tournaments), it would be around 40million in 2018 and 60million in 2019(give or take 10 million for each year).  Now to compete, where would you have to rank for your specific platform(pc, console), region(example: NA, EU,etc.) and in the world(as they stated they are going to be holding competitions all over the globe, which would mean an even large base of players competing) to be able to compete and make a decent amount of money(I would say between 50k-100k as the minimum) and where would you have to rank to become wealthy(make over 500k)? Is it worth dropping other activities for a year(example:school) to try and pursue these opportunities to see if you can make it, or are the chances too slim(I've seen in other games, if you are not top 100 in the whole world(and in some games more like top 30) it's very difficult to make a decent amount of money from that game. Will this be the same for fortnite?). Just to add in another point and make a comparison, the 300th best player in the NBA will still be a millionaire or very high six figure earner, but will the 300th best fortnite player still be able to make a decent amount of money or will it only be someone in the top 100.

Sure you get kills, but they’re mostly on people with a bad weapon and no mats. You basically get nothing out of that fight in the end and just lose health. I started dropping hotspots, yet avoid contact until I have a lot of mats (not contesting anyone for one house loot). In the end, you just third party the last guy in the area and you basically have all the loot in the POI in one spot. 

Just to say I’m not going for low kill games, I just prefer pushing a lot in mid to late game. For example, I might go out of retail with 2 kills or even less, then rack up a lot of kills 5-6 in mid game instead. With this strategy I ended up getting myself from 2.5 k/d weekly with a 5% solo win rate, to 4.13 k/d with a 14% solo win rate weekly, as well as averaging 7&gt;kills per win.

maybe the drop off rate isn't bad, but if it isn't then that just means it already packs a hell of a punch. comboing the double pistols with the pump/heavy makes them your secondary ; and with the tac/(maybe heavy) they can be a primary. (most players use 2-3 guns for a close range fight)
let's think about what the double pistols mean for your other slots
heals
double pistols
scopedar/ sniper/ heavy spray gun
splodes/more heals
shotgun

you are antibase, you can dominate build battle encounters (new meta says spray is outdated), you have space for ranged encounters (if you still aren't happy with the surprising viability of the double pistols or you want to pull from more ammo types), you can heal and conserve ammo.

this play style fits most gameplay strategies and believe me when i tell you the double pistols are helping your aim.

First time posting in this subreddit (I apologize if I missed some rules in regards to how I should post).

Thoroughly enjoying the discussions here (well, most anyway) surrounding the competitive scene. I've been playing since mid Season 4 and - though I'm awful - love how difficult the game is (in terms of building/build battles, understanding rotations, etc).

I've seen posts about a pistol buff or questioning the viability of dual pistols, but I was curious what your thoughts were on an AR pistol? For those who don't know, an AR15 can be modified into a legal AR pistol, simply by changing out your buttstock for an ATF approved accessory to replace it.

Outside of early game, I can't remember the last time I chose a pistol for my loadout or found the need to carry one (unless *forced* to). Heading into mid-late game, there's only so many viable options/loadouts. 

Not sure what the details would be, but here a few things I was thinking (obviously open to all suggestions):

**All rarity levels of the AR Pistol:** Held like an AR, except the character doesn't shoulder it.

**Common AR Pistol:** Shoots semi-auto AR caliber rounds, slightly less damage (or the same) than the AR and similar bloom to common pistol.

**Uncommon/Rare AR Pistol:** Full auto AR caliber rounds, with 20 rd magazines (slightly quicker reload time than the AR). Initially, I was think 15-18 rd magazines, with a significantly quicker reload time. Less damage than standard uncommon/rare AR's and/or more bloom. I understand the concept of bloom, but not sure how much it should have. I'd imagine a significant amount more since you're unable to shoulder it (meaning that since the recoil/muzzle rise would increase, so would the bloom).

**Epic/Legendary AR Pistol:** Full auto AR caliber rounds, with suppressor (like current epic/legendary pistols). This would do slightly less or similar damage than the rare AR, but with the suppressor, it can offer more accuracy and less bloom.

I've attached a picture to this post to give you an idea of what I was thinking.

I don’t know if Epic has it already in mind but making the community’s opinion clear and loud would help.",FortniteCompetitive

I’m looking to get into the 3-4 kd range with a 7-10% winrate. 
        For most of the season I’ve been landing at loot lake factories, which nets me a kill in about a third of games. I can also get 1-2 more by sweeping the rest of the lake. Usually I die to someone in the 2-4 kd range in the late midgame phase. I’m thinking the two major things holding my KD back is not having many kills earlygame due to landing at an unpopular spot, and not being as capable of killing the good players as I could be. It is impossible for me to achieve my desired stats/skill due to these two reasons. Do you agree with this assessment?

His job is to ask a few dumb questions here and there to help casuals learn the format, which he is pretty good at doing, and if you don’t like that, then just don’t watch him, because that aspect is necessary while streaming a game mostly meant for kids who don’t know much about the competitive scene. He is NOT supposed to be a play by play commentator that knows everything, that’s the pro player’s role and that’s why they’re there.

What he really needs to work on is his reaction to cool moments, he just screeches which is pretty annoying, but if he stops that he’ll be fine, he’s not even supposed to play by play, his lack of knowledge is not as bad as week 1, he knows a lot, only mistake I saw him make was saying metal was the worst material to build with (he didn’t know the patch)

My point is you guys are blowing everything out of proportion and acting like he’s horrible and should be fired, his screeching is annoying but he hasn’t done much wrong other than that, he’s open to criticism according to his co casters, so he definitely will improve more as he is miles better than how he was in week 1",FortniteCompetitive

1. Provide an option to have single click building placement (once B or Circle is placed to turn on building mode, allow us to instantly place building pieces without having to click twice or hold). The purposes for having the preview of a build appearing before placing it are pre-editing and having a visual of where the piece will place. Having the visual isn't necessary and pre-edits are rarely used - however, something like up on the d-pad could be used for switching the building preview on while in building mode if a pre-edit needs to be made.
2. Change the editing button from holding down B or circle to tapping Y or triangle (pulling out the pickaxe would be changed back to what it used to be in standard, holding down Y or triangle). Editing is much more time sensitive than pulling out the pickaxe and I think any console player would accept that trade off. 
3. Switch the buttons for rotating builds and switching materials. Use the D pad to rotate builds (far more natural, there are literally already buttons for left and right, make front and back rotate 180) and R3 to switch materials. Now that brick and steel are stronger, it can be useful to switch in certain situations (also accidentally switching material types in a fight isn't nearly as annoying/devastating as say accidentally rotating stairs mid combat).
4. Fix the issues with the special items section (rotating through and placing the wrong item). One option to improve this could be mapping each of the 4 special items to the build buttons already used in builder pro once X or square is pressed. If they are worried about adding or removing special items, switch rotating special items to pressing down the right stick.",FortniteCompetitive

I have mostly played sports video games (Madden/FIFA), but I occasionally sprinkled in a FPS. A buddy of mine told me to download Fortnite and the game was a blast. I started playing towards the end of S2 and I probably played 4-8 hours a day if given the chance. I remember the thrill of getting my first kill, getting my first win and playing with my buddies as bots. Deaths didn't matter and wins meant everything. Flash forward to the end of S3 and I started becoming a good player, I was winning more frequently and still playing as much as possible. I never had any issues with the game. Season 4 was a lot of the same. I loved playing and double shotgun meta was probably the most fun I've ever had in this game. I started playing wagers (mostly winning) and I started doing solo snipes all the time. The only issue is that I was in my last year of undergrad and the game was taking up so much of my time. I managed fine but the game was so much fun that I put it ahead of other activities often. 

Now, in Season 5, the game just doesn't do it for me anymore. The spam meta and removal of double shotgun has lost the lust of Fortnite for me. I can hardly play solo games anymore without just getting bored after a few games. The only thing that keeps me from uninstalling the game is playing duos or squads with friends. 

Part of the problem is the ongoing issues on Xbox right now. I play on the older system and the problems are seemingly limitless. 

I referenced most of them here and people seem to agree: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/943q5k/console_gameplay_is_terrible_right_now/

What I'm getting at is that the changes to the meta and lack of changes to help performance have helped me wean off Fortnite. I'm honestly kind of glad the game isn't like S3/S4 anymore. I start graduate school soon and I can't imagine I'd be as productive if the game was still like it was in the prior seasons. 

However, I will say that I've become thoroughly interested in the competitive scene and watching the pros play the game. It's a different style of gameplay and it makes for good entertainment. I'll continue to keep up with the game because the pro scene is the best thing Fortnite has going for it right now. Anyway, these are some of my thoughts and reasons on why I'm glad the game isn't like S3/S4 anymore. It's allowing me to be more productive in other aspects of life. ",FortniteCompetitive

Believe it or not, there's more to it than what your average viewer complains about - his frequent bursts of forced high-pitched laughter.

In my opinion, it breaks down to 3 main reasons:

###1) There are far better, and more accomplished casters out there 

This one is a bit of a passion point of mine. For those of you who don't know, being an eSports caster is not an easy job. Unless you're contracted by companies like Riot, it's basically free lance work where you have no financial security as most gigs only become available on very short notices. People spend years honing their craft, gradually building up their repertoire from small tournaments to be able to cast in major league matches. 

The fact that Zeke, a video editor with no prior experience just put his hand up to Epic because ""he wanted to do it"" and was selected to cast a multi-million dollar tournament is honestly ridiculous and I personally find it infuriating that Epic would rather hire their own unqualified employee instead of a professional caster, at the detriment of the viewing experience. 

###2) Zeke does not know how to fulfill the role of either 'Color Casting' OR 'Play by Play' Casting

I'm not sure if people are familiar with these terms but an ingame casting team usually consists of a duo of Color Caster and Play by Play Caster. The play by play caster, as you can probably guess, narrates the action as it happens.  Whereas a color caster fills in during the time when there's very little action - usually by analysing the current game situation. 

Outside of these two, you also usually have a host, who guides the conversation between games but usually does not add much of their own input. 

Now analysing Zeke, it's quite clear he does not have the in game knowledge to be a color caster.. and the less I talk about his play by play casting, the better. What role does he fulfill then? I suppose he's a decent host. He puts the questions to his partners on desk, and asks for their input and analysis on the game. Also, he's the one keeping track of all the points, which to give him credit, he's done a fair job at. However, in a team of two, when most of his partners on desk are just community personalities, he needs to carry all three roles to a decent level. Considering all the complaints of him shrieking anytime anything even remotely exciting happens, it's quite clear he's not fulfilling any roles in-game.

###3) The internet either likes you or it doesn't.

This is all that needs to be said, really. An eSports presenter needs to be someone people on the internet take a liking to from the start. I don't mean to question Zeke's personality IRL but it's quite clear what the opinion most people on the internet have of him, and it's overwhelmingly not positive.

To end it all, I just want to say that Courage raised a fair point when he said Zeke is a decent caster considering that he's just starting out. The only issue is, Fortnite is the BIGGEST online game right now and you'd bet that there's a multitude of professional casters out there looking to get into the Fortnite eSports scene (even in it's infancy). When you're running the most lucrative and popular game right now with a prize pool as significant as 8 MILLION dollars, you don't just settle for an amateur who's just starting out. You hire the best. If you want to give your eSports scene some legitimacy, try starting out by hiring better casters.

I either outbuild them both but then one of them keeps building while the other tries to shoot me down/spray me! Or get outbuild, so I try to disengage if I got bouncepads etc...

Then for solo squading... I just don't know how to take fights against 4 people when I'm on the open, in a hill, spot a full team of non-potatoes and have to take the fight without natural height advantage! 

I try to snipe one but generally when I miss I'm kinda screwed, and even when I don't they just keep shooting me/us down, I run out of mats etc etc... 

Pump kinda sucks, I generally can kill 2/4, or 3 if my pump gets full HS damage but then there's always the guy that comes when I'm low mats, low health and I can't kill him. 

Any tips? I try to force split them but when one of them is a really good player and the others are spraying my builds it's hard! 

Thanks!

Even fiber connection only gets you like 70 ping if you are on the west coast. In a lot of games this wouldn't matter that much but fortnite is arguably the most ping affected game in the world due to building and editing. 

Now an obvious victim of this is definitely TSM. Although I agree that all of them need to scrim more I think that if we had central servers they would be at least able to put their amazing mechanical skill into action much better. All three of them have ridiculous mechanical skill (especially Hamlinz) and while I agree their lack of experience and practice is the biggest factor I also think that ping is a huge issue.

1.  Bracket style tournaments.  I don't know about you guys but I absolutely LOVE bracket style tournaments in competition.  The comebacks, the stomps, the loser bracket runs, the controversies, I love it all.  Every single game felt meaningful.
2. It was fun as a viewer to watch the players interact with the other team before, between, and sometimes during matches.  Some of the players are really funny but you don't get to see their personalities come out when all they are doing are making call outs and talking to their teammate.  And solo was just terrible from a viewers perspective.  I'd really like to see what the interaction would be like in a squads tournament.
3. Having the finals be the deciding game.  This coincides with #1 but going into the finals with uncertainty was way more enjoyable than the skirmishes where you have a pretty good idea who is going to win more than halfway through.  Even though FAZE was particularly dominant you never felt like they had a guaranteed win in the later rounds.  In the Skirmish, aside from week 3, it felt like the winner was decided well before the final game and the last games were just going through the motions.

Even though pubstomping isn't the way to go I hope they find a way to bring some of these things back.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Ive been playing Fortnite since season 3 , 1 of the biggest struggles I had when first starting like most others is building in fights. I would find myself in jumping shotgun fights a lot and wouldn’t remember to build until I died . I struggled with this all season , I was very inconsistent in my building. Sometimes I would build and sometimes I wouldn’t. I tried many different strategies like practicing building in 50v50 but when it came down to a fight I simply just wouldn’t build. Until i started this strat........ 

How I fixed my issue and got in the habit of building immediately in a fight is a good story. I literally would land in Wailing Woods every game farm up till 999 would and not pick up a single weapon. Yes you read that correctly, NOT PICK UP A SINGLE WEAPON. My sole purpose in the match was to outbuild any opponents that pushed me to stay alive. Not having any weapons I was forced to build every single time An opponent saw me . I would build up than drop down and run every fight. Id seriously get to top 25 pretty consistently which is funny lol .... After several games of doing this it fixed my issue of not building , this strategy alone got me into the habit of building every single fight now and I thought this would help if shared :)

Let me know if this strategy works for you :) Remember JUST BUILD. ",FortniteCompetitive

I see in comp/scrim people would use a lot of gun i rarely see in publix match like Scoped AR, thermal scoped, LMG.. And the most addition of double barrel is most benefit for comp since everyone is tunneling/snaking and fight within extremely close range. Double barrel isn't trash, I just dont see a lot of average player pick it up over other shotgun in regular match. 


Beside guns, a lot of other balance affect competitive more than regular match and people just like ""don't fix what isn't broken"" but its how epic make competitive more healthy (llama nerf, material choice, shotgun delay, or even addition of smg..)


This is might be my first game where competive and pub has totally different meta in term of weapon choice. I think public meta is still gonna be a mess until Epic find a good balance and format for competive since they're testing a lot of thing with summer skirmish.

People are asking them to get rid of bloom and to stop the ability to laser people. It is impossible to fix both these problems.

without bloom you would be getting lasered constantlyand in a game with no respawns it can greatly affect your gameplay. This is the reason games like call of duty don’t have any bloom when you ADS. However with bloom it can lead to unfair fights as one person may be getting bloom in favour of them. This is why people say it will fail as a competitive/e-sports game.

Demanding Epic to fix both these completely contradict each other and is not possible.Mechanic-wise the game is in a great spot, with a fix to the meta (which is clear most of the community does not enjoy) the game will be enjoyable for competitive and casual gamers. It’s either prioritise competitive play or casual.

Edit: if the game wants to balance both casual and competitive play, reduce bloom (not completely) and increase damage drop-off. This is what OW did and that is by far one of the most succesful e-sports ever. It will balance guns and make them more specialised in different scenarios.",FortniteCompetitive

How do I improve?,"Before this weekend I thought that console players wouldn't be able to compete with top Pc players but it is possible since BrokenPSN and KamoLRF bothe finished Top 5 and Top 10.

Now I am wondering what I need to do to get to their skill levels. My lifetime stats are 5kd 23% Wr and s5 are 15kd and 60% wr. I've watched their streams and in comparison my aim is good and my positioning is good. The main thing that they are doing a lot better is building so what did they do to get so good at building? 

For reference my sens is 6/6 and I'm unsure if I really need to up my sens to be a better builder or if its just a matter of learning techniques off in playground and making them muscle memory.

Also things I thought that could help me improve would be maybe doing Pg vs good Pc players and doing custom key  Eu scrims if that's possible from ps4 cross platform. Any advice would be appreciated. ",FortniteCompetitive

But in my opinion, the llama nerf helped to make this game more competitive and reduce the rng in the early game.

I see plenty of people on twitter and even here on reddit talking about how they want the old llamas to come back. Personally i don't think this game can ever be really competitive with massive rng elements like llamas that give the person who finds them a major advantage over everyone else in the early game. Llamas contain healing items, traps, ammo, and a grenade with 600 mats. 600 mats is more than enough for the early game already. 1500 mats was a ridiculous amount of materials and with the healing items from a llama you can almost heal up to full hp!

Personally, i believe epic nerfed llamas because they were trying to make the game more competitive and less rng. If you have any of your own opinions about llamas then please let me know.

For me is hard to think there is skill gap, sure there is indeed skill gap in building but there is a lot of other things where there is no skill gap in this game.

Today I went against a couple of players, all they did is turtle themselves, I put pressure by shooting them, then I get third partied, so I'm forced to push the player turtling, guy just spams traps inside his box and kills me (traps should not activate the moment they are put, this requires no skill at all, definitely needs some adjustments). 

SMG meta, seriously, if I'm hip firing this guy and he is hip firing me and his shots register and not mine, since he is getting that lucky bloom, I'm dead, sure I could build, but if we are extremely close where building won't matter. 

Early game RNG, this seriously pisses me off. The moment you go inside a house, no weapons, no chest, nothing, and the biggest bot comes inside the house and kills you since he has a tactical which is the easiest gun to use.

I personally could just suggest a couple solutions to this and it could possibly increase skill gap. 

1- Reduce bloom rng.

2- Make chests and loot floor spawn more often, I seriously do not understand why is there rng in spamming weapons or chests, is like oh, sorry, no chest here this time, and no weapons, sorry.",FortniteCompetitive

So I slowly learned how to build fast enough to last long in build fights. I know some methods to regain high ground (reddit bounce pad, 2-layer stairs with a turnaround, phuck dis ima build circularly around ur towah), but sometimes people get to place a ramp right on my head and it just annoys me to death, literally. I'm aware that building mechanics can't really be explained in written text (even though my imagination would help a lot), so if you consider yourself a good builder, please dm me so we could practice in playground. I just wanna build well enough to gaiin the upper hand on many other players.

So I think there are three major skills to improve in this game. One of them - logically - is aiming, the other is building, and then decision making. So I usually play duos (or solos), and pretty much all the games we could win was because of my decision making. I made the calls, my bud did the killing, and it was enough to win. Well, I'm better than im at close range, but that only made a difference in 4-5 victories. In the meantime my aim got a lot better, and I learned to build on a basic level. Now it's time to improve this to ""advanced"".

Yesterday our very first game ended with 8 kills altogether, 4-4 for both of us. And in one of the fights I landed a hunting rifle headshot...differently. I could see the target jumping off their ramp, and I could see him jump again. Then I could see myself scoping in for the predicted spot, and I shot in the right time. But it wasn't like those ""whatever, Ima just hit him"" shots, I somehow *knew* he would be there. For a couple of games after we had no luck in finding floor loot (if you ever go to Salty, never **ever** land to the red brick house, we found literally nothing there lol), we made a comeback in Shifty. From then on, I could feel that I was in control and my brain was taking in every detail of every fight, and I kept winning them because I knew what was I doing. So do you guys happen to know this feeling? Also, do you have any methods to condition yourselves towards this state of mind? Because I feel like my aim is all about my mentality. And there must be a way to see the game like this self-consciously as well.

Also, if you have any ""advanced"" improvement tips, please tell me.

But now, at the cusp of competitive, one major issue stands in the third-person shooter’s way: pacifism. 

As talented players banded together for early stages of pro level scrimmaging, the “turtling” meta was apparent. Eager to win, opponents barricaded themselves in intricately crafted tunnels and avoided unnecessary combat till the very last zones, where they could comfortably out-heal the opposition. That docile nature of play proved to be the first Summer Skirmish’s undoing, concluding after just 4 matches due to overwhelming lag. Analytics determined that a combination of mass spectating, build clusters and densely populated zones put more strain on servers than anticipated. With minimal benefits of fragging, endgames devolved into crowded chaos where spamming reigned supreme. These issues, in conjunction with lackluster action, made Fortnite’s first official online tournament a certified flop. 

So what can Epic do to remedy passiveness and revitalize the most popular BR of 2018? It’s simple, really; incentivize combat and then incentivize it some more. With the advent of a point per kill format in week five Skirmish, viewers enjoyed more pogchamp plays, but this did little to dilute endgame density. By tier 4 zones, an average of 26 players remained. More can and should be done to ensure that competitors embrace eliminations as a necessary component of earning victory royales. Here, I’ve listed potential in-game mechanics that achieve just that: 

The first adjustment is **ATROPHY**. Instead of (or in addition to) damage dealing storms, your HP automatically ticks away. As the match progresses and zones close in, your health drains faster. But the more you move (builds, distance traveled, shots taken, etc.), the less you tick and vice versa. Perhaps, as added motivation, your eliminations conversely affect your rate of degradation. 

Next, incorporate **ACCUMULATIVE HP**. Similar to heart containers in The Legend of Zelda, each frag you earn increases your health bar. This can be fixed or relative (a set boost per kill vs. adding the amount of damage you delt), but fixed is more balanced in theory. For instance, with +50 shield and health per frag, 3 kills equates to 250/250. By end game, “juggernauts” have an advantage. This also inhibits the effects of atrophy. Additionally, the bonus health is automatically acquired, making it easier to sustain third party pushes from scroungers. Hopefully, this also discourages 3P tags that would ultimately gift enemies easier HP boosts.

**CHUNK FARMING** is an indirect approach, but it achieves the objective nonetheless. A mat cap nerf and farming buff is probably the most intriguing concept of the four, because such a small change could drastically influence the propensity for battle, and majority of the pros seem to agree. In the game’s current state, engagements are a punishable offense. Health and resources are quickly depleted, forcing survivors to scamper and scavenge well into late game. That said, it’s ideal to avoid fights all together. When you decrease mat cap, you subsequently reduce the duration of build fights and encourage versatility with creative uses of traps, bounce pads, impulse nades and more. Once the fight concludes, replenishing resources isn’t a daunting task. Note: even if farming is tweaked, it shouldn’t be buffed beyond the consideration of time management and strategy.

**MAP &amp; COMBAT MOBILITY** will optimize rotations and cultivate dynamic battles. Make rifts permanent and more prevalent, and decrease the rarity of jump pads. This will enhance your ability rotate to and from POIs, engagements and zones. Buff impulse nades for competitive relevance and lower the drop rate of bounce pads. Imagine the viability of these items when they’re more accessible and players can effectively utilize them in combat. This may not seem like a radical implementation, but it would completely alter the flow of a game. 

Battle Royales put more emphasis on survival than combat. Of course, you could challenge every opponent you encounter, but you could also avoid conflict as long as possible and increase your odds of winning. When kills grant extra health, inactivity hastens self-inflicted damage and fights don’t put players at a huge resource disadvantage, skirmishes become a vital part of nabbing the dub. Players have the liberty to sustain momentum and pursue crucial engagements, consequently delivering fast-paced, action-packed and, ultimately, exciting gameplay to spectate. The Fortnite Fury LTM would drastically change the face of Fortnite as we know it, but maybe that’s the leap Battle Royales need",FortniteCompetitive

I just did a count and no joke, half the threads on the front page of this sub are about pro scrims happening right now or in the past couple of hours. 

I think adding some sort of megathread for scrims going on each day would be really helpful and would sort through all of the clutter. 

As far as talk of the scrims themselves, I think a lot of people are getting way too ahead of themselves. 

First, people are COMPLETELY overvaluing the results of scrims and drawing rediculous conclusions about players and teams simply based off of one or two days worth of scrims. 

Second, I don’t think this amount of interest in scrims is sustainable. I don’t want rain on anyone’s parade, but I garuntee in a months time the interest in pros scrims will be a mere fraction of what it is now. I was kind of bummed to see a thread where the OP asked if “anyone missed Friday Fortnite”.. and essentially the responses were “nope. It got stale and scrims are much better now anyway” I’m not saying pubstomping is a great environment for competitive fortnite but it did help establish a name for some of the pro players and was really fun to watch. 

I think watching and learning from scrims is entertaining and educational, I just think we should put less stock in the results and enjoy it for what it is!

What should the play be here? Should I turtle and wait for him to drop down, then try to retake it, or zone to push us away? 
I think this is the best bet, this is what a lot of players have been doing against me, once I have the highground my opponent will try to retake it once or twice, then give up on highground and start to turtle and just wait. 

Ive only been playing regular solos so I haven't had any experience with any decent builders till now.

I don't like being passive and turtle so its new to me but this seems like one of the only valid strats in this situation, thoughts on this?  ",FortniteCompetitive

My idea is basic. Instead of having to press your edit key to confirm an edit, an option to auto-confirm when you release your building select key (by default mouse 1). This way, editing becomes much simpler and less clunky feeling to pull off.

And it’s safe to say most of people hating are console players or pc players who have not tried the res out at all. So I am here to clarify some things.

People use it mainly because they were used to playing stretched on other games like cs go and h1z1 like me. Yes the game looks “worse” but that’s just because your eyes aren’t used to the resolution. Yes, it does not make a huge difference when it comes to hitboxes but there is a difference without a doubt. There is increased FPS, FOV, and in my opinion reduced input lag while on stretched and some people including myself also feel like the movement is way more smooth.

No Tfue and myth did not start the era of stretched res it’s just that many of their viewers are more on the casual side of the game and do not watch the few pros that used stretched from way back. There actually were lots of people using stretched but since many of them are very underrated compared to Tfue and Myth not a lot of people saw stretched res back during season 3/4.

I have personally switched through multiple resolutions since starting to really grind fortnite in the beginning of season 3 and can confirm there is a huge difference. I have swapped between 1920x1080, 1280x1024, and 1440x1080 more times than I can count. A lot of people only mention hitboxes but that’s really not the reason I play stretched. The game’s movement in my opinion just feels really clunky and slow on 1920 compared to when I play stretched. In the end it’s literally just preference and you shouldn’t switch just because your “favorite streamer” is doing it.

And for everyone talking about how streamers should care that they are making their viewers watch gameplay that “looks ugly”, either deal with it or find someone else to watch. There’s a reason behind everything they do and it is not just to make you watch ugly gameplay. I personally don’t give a crap how the gameplay looks, if the player is amazing I’ll watch them either way because I if I’m gonna watch a pro I’m gonna judge his stream based on how he plays not on how his graphics look.",FortniteCompetitive

I stopped using WASD for my movement.,"Long story short, I stopped using WASD as my movement. Instead I started using TFGH. This allows me to access more keys, as well as all of my fingers can access to other keys (this sounds a bit odd but I'll explain later).

I used to build with FGCR (reload key being left ctrl and crouch key X). But when I build with those keys I used only my index finger. For a long session game play my index finger started hurting.

After changing to TFGH keys, I was able to access more keys. For example, I was able to press more keys with my ring and pinky fingers allowing me to build with those fingers too! Not only that my thumb was also able to access my right alt key which I binded to traps.

Took 2 - 3 days for me to get used to and get back to where I was, but I must say it was 100% worth it! I no longer feel any more discomfort nor pain. I also feel like I can build faster and easier.

My new keybindings if you are interested:

TFGH = move

space = jump

right alt = trap

left alt = pickaxe

weapon slot 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = 4 5 6 i m

use = y

reload = w

inv = s

build keys (wall, floor, stairs, pyramid) = d, e, j, b

edit = r

For instance the CSGO pro's all have around the 9-10k hours in CSGO. That is roughly 1500 hours a year and they have to travel to events etc too. They also played either 1.6 or Source and clocked in the same amount of hours there if not more. So we looking at 20k+ hours in basically one game. 

If you want to become a pro/streamer Fortnite you have to grind your ass off every fucking day for 8+ hours. When you play on a weekly basis 10-20 hours more than your competition you will improve more. It is that simple. If you stream more hours than your competition people will go to your stream because you are consistent with it. 

Of course there are different ways of practicing the game and one method might be more efficient than the other but at the end of the day. The ones with the most hours into the game are the best at it.

Scumpi in the CoD scene is good example of this. He always tweeted stuff like CoD is life and played the game every day for almost 10 if not more hours. People always called him the best CoD player ever but this year he is underperforming. Why? Because he doesn't like the current game that much and it reflects to the amount of hours he plays everyday.

From watching Sypher play in and tourneys and against other pro’s in general I feel like he has underperformed. He has great decision making and an undeniably high ”Game IQ” but I feel like he is lacking quite a lot in pure mechanical skill as well as making fast-paced plays. He always takes time to make his moves, which can be seen in his building, he doesn’t build fast just to make sure he makes no mistakes and from what I’ve seen this has ended up punishing him. I think that this is a result of him overthinking and allows his better opponents to outplay him. (Allowing them to get highground
etc)

I like to compare Sypher to Mongraal since I feel like they are complete opposites. Mongraal is all mechanical skill. He has incredibly fast building and amazing gunskill, while lacking a bit in decision making. He is a very ”fast” player and makes sure not to waste time. Sypher is imo the opposite to that, very high game IQ and great decision making but lacks in the other aspects. He always makes sure to take his time as opposed to Mongraal.

I’ve always wondered who of the two would win if they had a realistic 1v1. But anyways, that’s besides the point. What do you guys think? Please add your opinions as intend for this to be a discussion.

The other pistols are also very weak, with perhaps the exceptions of the suppressed pistol and the dual pistols. The revolver and deagle, which are meant to be ""mini snipers"", have pump-level slowness close up and horrible damage at range (at least the revolver does, haven't used the deagle enough to know for sure).

I'm not saying the pistols should be buffed into a viable end game weapon like SMGs, but right now it's unclear to me what their purpose is in the game. Are they just meant to be picked up when you have nothing else and swapped out when you find a better gun? Epic says they want all sorts of weapons and play styles to be viable, but they seem to be ignoring the pistols.

I think the pistols should get a reasonable accuracy (especially hip fire) and damage buff like the SMGs did a few months ago to make them at least usable in the first two minutes of the game. What are your thoughts? ",FortniteCompetitive

I think this was a terrible mistake. 

What the tac sub did so great was it was extremely balanced. While it could melt if you were at the proper range, it had drawbacks. 

It performed best at closish medium range while it was still usable at super close to medium range but did not excel. What this did, was made you chose between a shotty and an ar or to take all three and lose another slot. 

Another drawback was that since it shot so fast, it ran out of a magazine very quickly which made spraying at buildings have a cool-down unlike the drum gun or the p90 where u can spray forever and makes very boring and uninteresting fights. 

I don’t think they really thought it through when they took it out of the game in place if the sub and the p90. It had a proper place in the game and should not have been touched. 

Let me know your thoughts to this topic because as of now, fortnite is very uninteresting compared to when that was in the game. (Made even worse when they nerfed the health of buildings). But yeah im kinda bummed they’ve been more keen on adding new additions to the game rather than perfecting a formula which they have been so close to.

The reason being? There has been no measurable improvement between each week.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to hate on zeke. The man could be a great caster for fortnite if he put in the time. No one expected him to be perfect on day one. But, at this point, he had over a month to learn how to better fit into his role as the face of competitive fortnite casting. Sadly, we have watched as the same mistakes are made over and over.

Zeke should be practicing casting, watching VODS of the past skirmishes, and critiquing his own casting. He needs to study the game and learn more about the mechanics and general gameplay elements so that he doesn’t misinform the casual viewers (dying faster after second down?). He needs to learn to control his emotions and determine a better vocal volume so that his screeches don’t leave us needing hearing aids. 

I just feel like zeke must not care about casting if it’s not important enough for him to try to improve...

&gt; There is no strategy behind this format.

Pros had literally 2 days to practice for this format, compare to the typical placement scrims that we have been playing for MONTHS. Turtling isn't new, it only became popular with the viewers when streamers decided to stream to the public. Strategy takes time to develop. This same argument was brought out on Friday Fortnite but Tfue and Cloakzy proved everyone wrong.

&gt; Doesn't feel like a BR game

If you actually want Fortnite to make it into Competitive the game have to run away from the vanilla BR format. BR games have failed eSports over and over because it's boring and tedious. eSports and competitive is an entertainment industry if there is no entertainment Fortnite will never make it as an eSport. They will become PUBG.

&gt; Feels like a Pub game and not a pro game

IT SHOULD, Viewers MUST connect to the matches this is crucial to any Competitive game. When you watch a tournament from Games such as CSGO, LoL, and Dota you feel connected, you can jump into the game right after and play exactly like the Pros.

**Reasons Why I believe Week 5 format is probably the best format for competitive Fortnite:**


1.PROs vs PRos and NOT Pros vs Circle.

  - For those who scrims know that the current scrim strategy is formulated around the end circle and it highly depends on your late game positioning and layout (Like healing) which is all dependent on RNG. Most of the end game turns out of who wins the end circle or comes out to a healing off.

2.Diversity playstyles.

- Placement format only brings one playstyle and its passive. Players are playing for survival because the risk is simply too big to take. We saw this last weekend where MOST fights would end on a disengagement. Week 5 format brings something different, teams can choose games to be passive and game to aggressive without the fear of losing it out. Similar to day 1 where Liquid played Aggressively one game to gain the bonus points then choose to be Passive the next game. NOTVIVID and Poach also used a similar strategy.

3.Skill GAP

- This is the first week where the Top 10 was filled with PROS and not content creators compared to any other week. Due to end Circle RNG, even a bad team could luck out and get a very high placement, this would be literally impossible on a week 5 format.

4.Entertainment

- This is self-explanatory, this week format was a lot more entertaining The constant action, highlights and clutch moments were at an all-time high, Fortnite stream was at an AVG 180k viewers until the 8th game where last week it was at 100k by the 4th game. This is important since no game can survive entering eSports without viewership and hype.

5.Clutching moments

- For anyone who follows any competitive games, you know how exciting and important clutch moments are, Ghost gaming was able to clutch their way to the top. Not to mention the 1v2's!

These are my reasons for why I believe a HIGH kill Incentive format similar to Week 5 is better than a placement format for Fortnite entering competitive, Let me know what you think.",FortniteCompetitive

I keep seeing posts and comments about how Myth needs to be dropped, and Hamz is the only good TSM member. Hamz hasnt done anything great in a long while, and was outperformed by Myth in the Solo Skirmish last week. (even though they were both much below par). Daequan has seemingly no desire to do scrims, and is apparently going to become a ‘variety streamer’ so even though I love his personality and sense of humour, I think its time to say goodbye to him if he cant dedicate himself. As for Hamlinz, imho he is currently the best on TSM but needs to scrim solo more if he wants to keep up with other top pros. If he does this he can compete but if he doesnt he could get left in the dust in the weeks/months to come.

For Myth, i dont think he’s a team captain, as he lacks communication skills (as shown in week 5 with hamlinz) but he seems to be the only one on the team with a competitive drive to get better. And as the meta changes the best players can change too. The players who play against the best will slowly catch up with the best, whereas those who don’t risk being left behind (shown by the way myth was considered the best w/ninja in the first few months, but isn’t anymore). 

If TSM want to compete in the Fortnite pro scene (which they undoubtedly do) theyre going to need to sign at least 2 new members, and get Hamlinz to scrim more, or have a complete overhaul. This might seem difficult as most of the a lot of top players are already signed to teams but SS has showed that there are plenty of talents that arent. An example of this is NotVivid, who if TSM sign, could be a real game changer. Not just for his skill but for his emotionless decision making, which Myth is definitely lacking atm.

Tl;dr: As much as I love Dae, TSM need to sign 2 top tier players if they want to compete with the best.

Yes, I understand I am going to get the responses from people who are *God Tier* saying to “Quit Whining” and “Put up or Shut up, NoOb!” 

The reason people started playing this game was because there was such a skill gap. You aren’t going to be good at any game once you start playing it. You learn how to be good or you don’t play (*i understand that’s not a good business model and EPIC is for sure going to get as many people playing because that money in their pockets*). If someone can hop onto a game and simply hold down the trigger to be good, that’s how a game gets old. 

I loved playing fortnite because my competitive edge wanted to get good at every part of the game. It’s no longer fun to play (“gO PlAy A DiFfERENT GamE ThEnnnn!!”). With that said, I believe I can speak for many people buying saying all of this. I just want the game to be competitive, have a skill gap, and if someone isn’t good at something they have to learn to be good at it like i and many others did months ago.

When  I play duos, I've gotten many 10-11 kill wins, and lots of 9+kill losses, which is much more than when I play solo. However, my duo partner doesn't really do much. He usually has like 1-2 kills and I revive him often. I think with some practice and some tips I can get some high kill games if i solo duo. What are some must-know tips when going into a solo duo?

Double SMG/Drum gun is what makes the spray meta so bad. Its the most viable set up right now for the most part yet its so unhealthy and stupid for the game. This would make so many more guns viable like the AR. It would make it so shotguns won't need a delay when you build,etc because if you can't hold two shotguns anyways there isn't really a need for that timer. It would remove things like double explosives, which just create more spam towards building that doesn't even require some sort of skill.

I'm surprised they aren't getting more attention.,"Im talking about the fact that you can essentially overcome the clinger timer detonation by destroying an object it is stuck to while also hurting anyone behind it. You essentially have no defense against it besides just running.

 I can't be part of the minority that wants Clingers to work more consistently. They are broken and have been ever since their introduction. 

It hardly seems fair to be on the receiving end of them with the way they work. If I successfully block myself off from a clinger why should I be punished for that? The way they work now absolutely does not seem intended. 

The way they should work (In my own personal opinion): 
* Clingers always blow up a set amount of time after it being stuck to an object the first time. (For example whatever amount of time they blow up now normally is when they will always blow up. Destroying the object they are stuck to will not lengthen or shorten their timer)
* Clingers will now drop instead of blowing up immediately when an object they are stuck to is destroyed. (The same way C4's do)

I'm open to having my opinion changed on this if anyone believes they are working the way they should. Let's have a civilised discussion on this topic.",FortniteCompetitive

Sometimes it feels like the ten year olds from the main BR sub that think they know what they are talking about spill into this subreddit with their immaturity and false sense of game knowledge. Mind you that not every thread on this sub is like this, but a lot of them are. As a community separate from r/fortniteBR we claim to be ""competitive"", In most competitive subs I have frequented there is a level of maturity and thirst for actual discussion that is seemingly void from this sub. I hope the veteran gamers reading this can understand where I am coming from. I see a lot of hate pointed towards Zeke as a caster and very little advice offered up as to how he can improve, do you guys honestly think that anyone will take us seriously if we continue down this path? Sadly the efforts of those who are actually willing to provide the content this subreddit needs desperately are overshadowed by twenty upvoted comments of ""this player is so shit why is he on this team"", etc. I for one would like to see moderators shut these types of discussions down in favor of more civilized, productive discussion that I know this subreddit is capable of achieving. As a community we need to be better and set the example for actual points of competitive discussion that is lacking on the main fortniteBR subreddit. I know I'm not the only one who feels like this, so I urge my fellow competitive fortnite players to stop upvoting mindless hate.

There is too much mindless hate on this subreddit that should be eradicated in favor of actual constructive criticism that will help the community as a whole grow. ",FortniteCompetitive

All answers are appreciated!

1. What is the most efficient inventory setup order? (Ex. Assault Rifle-&gt;Shotgun-&gt;SMG-&gt;Heals-&gt;Sniper)
2. What is your ideal inventory load out? (guns) (Ex. Scar-&gt;Pump-&gt;Drum gun-&gt;Mini shields-&gt;Hunting rifle)
3. When switching guns, lets say Pump to SMG, do you hold down the trigger? (Ex. You press RT to shoot the pump, keep the trigger held down, and press LB to switch your gun while still holding RT down). Or do you let go of the trigger while switching guns? Also, when building a wall after a shotgun shot, do you hold down the trigger and press B, or let go of the trigger before pressing B.
4. Do you use your middle finger or index finger to press RT? (shooting/building button)
5. What sensitivity, or range of sensitivities, is ideal for someone who plays strictly solos? Common question I know, but opinions can change with the meta or with game modes. (High sensitivity might have been more efficient during the build-battle meta but not as much with shooting being a bit more important/High sensitivity might be needed when fighting multiple enemies but not in 1v1s).
6. When in a build battle, are 90 degree turns better than 180 degree turns? And do you build platforms when doing these turns, or just walls and ramps?
7. When doing ramp/floor/wall push, is the order of each piece floor, ramp, wall or ramp, floor, wall? Or something different? I know it may be preference but I'm curious what the majority do/which is easier, etc.
8. If I just want to improve at the game (Being able to beat the majority of the people I meet in a match), where should I be landing and how should I be playing? (Ex. Land at *-insert high population area-* and fight everyone you see. Land safer and loot up, then fight everyone you see.) I'm not worried about winning or losing currently.
9. How do I properly ""abuse"" high ground? When I obtain high ground in a fight, I usually take more damage than I deal when I peak over a wall or ramp to shoot at someone under me. I feel like they have a better angle. Feels like they can pre aim at my location where as I don't really know where they are, and when I peak they can shoot right away where as I need to locate them first, plus its hard for me to not shoot my structure instead of them. 
10. What order do you farm materials? I know metal is better than wood, but if you have lets say 1minute before you have to start moving to the circle, is 1 minute of farming metal better than wood? Because it would be like 500 wood vs 100 metal or something like that (just a random guess but you get the idea.) Currently I farm wood until I'm maxed and then I farm brick and metal sort of equally, depending on whats near me.
11. Pump Shotgun VS Tactical Shotgun VS Double barrel Shotgun? (Strengths/weaknesses, different play-styles for each gun, etc.)
12. Gold P90 vs Blue Drum gun? (same as above)
13. Hunting Rifle vs Bolt-action? (same as above)

And that's it. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask these questions, or if some of these questions are repetitive, ignorant, or commonly asked. Again, any help is very appreciated, thank you all in advance.",FortniteCompetitive

*Disclaimer: I am in NO way a professional Fortnite player, but did play competitive CS for years, and was the IGL. 

As the IGL - your main role is to check on how your teammate(s) are doing: Their mat count, loot, ammo, position. 

Hamz is a very passive caller in-game, waiting for your calls, a lot of the time not receiving them putting him in a compromising situation, where the only thing he could do is try to take high ground - meaning he was unable to trade a lot of the time when you were downed. 

Throughout the games your landing was largely dependent on rifts, lucky loot (landing at junk &amp; similar outlying spots) is always 50/50, and hoping you would get the circle - if not you were always playing into players who did, forcing you to push into them. - the only way to improve your bad loot is to challenge players for theirs when this is your strategy. 

Your lack of checking ammo boxes hurt you with regards to having enough ammo in fights. 

 In a game mode where kills were the only thing that mattered, you shied away from them. 

- the whole time you kept saying ""we had no loot"" - thats because you landed in a shit place all the time. 
______________________________________

Game 3: 
You killed Courage - and took all the loot. Again not checking on Hamz loadout. 

You killed Ninja - again not checking on Hamz - who at that point had inferior weapons, no mats and little to no ammo. 

______________________________________

Game 4: 
off your landing: Missed 2 ammo chests + pump 

You took the rift and instead of helping Hamz you drifted off - leaving him inbeween 2 teams - ""playing for yourself"". 

You got to Durr Burger - again leaving Hamz - ignoring the chest (when you had bad loot) - to go to the middle island, in the process getting tagged up. 

having run away for most of the game, you died because of your landing, not being able to get mats, and no heals.

Also early game thinking you can rotate motel no presuming that a team would be there already hurt you. This is a tournament where there are multiple pro teams taking the same strategy as you, you need to assume that there would be a team/player at every loot location.
______________________________________
You and Hamz both have the skill to match any player in the game, but you shy away from what could be populated areas, leaving you with little to no ammo, no loot, low on mats (because of late circle pushes).

The only thing stopping me on this plateau is my building ability. Granted I *can/know* how to build, know how to edit and maneuver my way around, but I guess for the lack of articulation you can say I'm not close to an expert or master level.

Any player that *really* knows how to build, take and maintain high-ground will always do so over me. I'll usually try to keep up or make one attempt at re-taking, but eventually just kind of reset or force the player to come back to low-ground and fight.

There's plenty of resources and videos on building but the clip of [Mongraal](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/960cme/imagine_the_competetive_scene_if_mongraal_was_16/) the other day caught my eye so I decided go over it a couple times. Enjoyed going through it because it's short and has *a lot* of different building patterns for various situations.

**So basically I'm watching his clip to take notes on things practice in playground -- so that they become reflex to me (such as turning in a direction unexpectedly getting shot from and building a wall) like it seemingly is for him.**

Also want to note literally **everything is situational**, there is no ""hey I gotta build `XYZ_ABC` exactly when situation #48 happens."" So after summarizing the clip I tried to aggregate his builds from similar situations.

---

Wrote the builds in a random syntax that would make sense to me later and the indents are grouped in *somewhat-likewise* builds.

* `Fb/Ft` - Floor (bottom/top)  
* `W` - Wall
* `R` - Ramp
* `P` - Pyramid

* Builds where he starts the piece when he jumps to when he lands is enclosed in `jump()`.  
* `FtP_spam` is the floor piece used as a ceiling with pyramid spammed while taking fire  
* `W_#°` - the angle at which he turbo builds walls.  
* `jpad_apex()` - buildings he places at the apex of the jump-pad.  
* `ed_X` - edit structure

So even as someone trying to become better at building (and as mentioned before) every build is situational so it's not worth trying to memorize anything. But the aggregation of builds do show patterns which are exactly likes *template* I was looking for.

Albeit all this may look dumb, or like I'm taking something simple and making it hard to some people. It's kinda what works for me.  If you've read this far and have any tips or comments, definitely share to discuss.

Although PC has a substantially higher skill ceiling, there are so many people who can’t build or shoot at all. With console having aim assist and easy building, I would argue that the average player on console is better than the average PC player, since the game can be learned so easily. However, PC is much more convoluted in its building that although it allows for a much higher skill ceiling, it provides many incompetents as well. TFue himself has gotten over 20 kills without taking damage on PC, console players could have easily fired an AR and let aim assist do all the work. What do you guys think?",FortniteCompetitive

In high pressure situations or epic plays, he doesn't give memorable calls. Sometimes he just goes ""UHGRUHGHRGUHHERURGEereueauauua."" It's weird. In larger (e)sports, these memorable calls are a part of the game.

The best middle ground I’ve found is retail row, farming the vehicles and metal fences near the b-ball court and the metal fences around the wood plank near the restaurant work well plus you get some action.

I tried making the pump work, but the pull out is just too much and doesn't compliments my play-style.

I will usually swap my sniper for an explosive late game since it's useless, but that's what i started doing lately.

no spam weapons, just your classical season 2-4 load out.

Some things i noticed are that i take way less damage after a fight, i had a bad habit of jumping down and spraying, and it's something i developed thanks to the spam meta, and i was overall careless, after around 2 days of using this load out i felt like i have improved tremendously when it comes to my building, how much damage i take, how i approach fights and my aim overall, and quick edit plays are mad fun =].

also having 2 med slots helps a lot.

I am aware that i am putting myself in a massive disadvantage, but i did that to improve my own game-play, the meta really set me back in terms of my own personal growth as a player, as the play-style that it incentives was not skillful at all.

359,JapandaGAMING,1533916057,9682rg,65,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9682rg/ranked_mode_rewards/,166,Ranked Mode &amp; Rewards,"*Created this because my comments in another thread were all spread out. This makes it easier to follow my intentions of what ranked could be*

Game Mode: **Ranked Solos**

*How to unlock*

Playlist unlocks after you achieve 10 solo wins. This will hopefully prevent new players from unknowingly joining into a playlist without really understanding the game. This will also keep people from constantly creating new accounts to stomp on new players entering the playlist.


*How ranked would work*

Your rank would reset each season.  The highest rank would be 50 and the lowest would be 1. In order to rank up you are required to win (maybe alternative would get a set number of kills for another way to rank up).  If you continuously lose your rank can decrease.  Ranks can't decrease past every 10 ranks (if you a rank 11 the lowest you can decrease would be rank 10). Once you reach rank 50 you will remain there for the remainder of the season until it resets next season.


*Matchmaking* 

Depending on your rank you would match up with people within 5-10 tiers of you.


*Display Name*

xSniperGAWDxx [11]  &lt;--- This would indicate your current rank in the killfeed or spectator screen


*Rewards*

Every 10 tiers is a different color. Green 1-9, red 10-19, blue 20-29, silver 30-39, gold 40-49, Diamond 50. And you get to select 1 item each season to colorize. For example i get to rank 50 in season 6 of fortnite and i get to colorize my Scythe pickaxe with diamonds. Season 7 of fortnite i get to rank 40 so i can colorize one of my gliders or skins clothes gold. Something like that

Most people can agree that AR sucks right ?

I thought about a simple idea that would be Instant FSA for the first shot.

So let's say you're not shooting at all, not using your weapon, just running or in your base. You spot an enemy, who is at med-long range, but if you want to shoot at him you have to wait about 1-2 sec for FSA to not get f\*cked by bloom (I don't know how much time it takes, but in the action it feels slow, at least for me).

Add to that the new peeking mechanics, you have to expose your whole body to shoot a bullet, it's broken, and right shoulder peeking too, anyway that's not the problem.

Now what Instant FSA would be : Instead of standing still for 1-2 Sec, your crosshair will immediately close and get FSA, but only for this first shot, after your weapon is ""cold""/not used for a period of time.

So just peeking, shooting, with Instant FSA for the first shot without having to wait the ""reset"" timer.

People would abuse that by cancelling ADS ? No, there's 3sec between each Instant FSA shot, so you can't abuse it, and it's still great for squads, or if you spot another person running somewhere else.

TL;DR Instant FSA for the first shot if your weapon wasn't used for a period of time (I proposed 3sec).

Thanks if you read, I'd really like to know your thoughts on that, in the comments !

I'm referring to the habit some have developed where you constantly jump when out of combat, presumably to make yourself a hard target for snipers.

A: The number of games where I've died from a shot that came out of nowhere is fairly low and doesn't warrant this.

B: By constantly hopping your perspective moves enough to where it will slightly disadvantage your ability to be aware of your surroundings. You're less likely to notice slight movement in the distance when you're all over the place.

C: This is compensating for poor positioning and awareness. If you're positioned well, reducing line of sight with potential sniping positions and you're decent at remaining aware of your surroundings then the random sniper shot is significantly less likely and there's no need for this.

D: By joining you have ensured that any players the did not see you, certainly have now. I've found so many people by seeing their head pop up over a hill and while jumping might make it harder to hit you, it's not enough to where I can't. So while I may never have seen you beforehand, now I might just need a second shot before I get you, if that. By jumping you've made it so you will never have the drop on someone because they will always see you coming.

E: God it's annoying to watch.",FortniteCompetitive

I love sports. I used to love playing sports but I got fat and now it is kind of hard for me to play, actually thinking about it, maybe not playing sports is the reason I got fat. But that is a different story for a different day. I was always competitive whether it was playing FIFA against my friends or even watching my favourite team Manchester United try and compete against other clubs (keyword: TRY). But sports and video games were always two separate entities to me with no correlation. However I realized I was wrong once I watched a stream for the very first time. 

I discovered twitch solely because of Nadeshot playing Road to 100-0 for Black Ops 3 with a guy called Merc. I wanted to know more about this Merc guy so I searched Youtube and did not get much. I thought maybe he is a streamer so I downloaded Twitch and searched for Merc. Guess who showed up? This fuckin’ white-beader wearing, meat head lookin’ and talkin’ motherfucker. I realized it was not the right guy but he intrigued me by playing online tournaments and being funny and goofy as shit. 

I knew when people played video games, they wanted to win. What I did not know was how seriously and competitively gamers actually took winning. So forward a couple months and this game called Fortnite comes out. I fell in love even though I was not the best. So I wanted to get better and started watching gamers stream them playing Fortnite. AND THEN Nickmercs started streaming it and boy was he fuckin’ good. I remember watching him grow so much, as a fortnite player but more importantly, I watched him grow as a streamer and reach all-time career highs every week now. He mostly went for kill records and once getting them, he started playing Fortnite tournaments. He was good, real good. That is why he won Friday Fortnite against pc players, and placed 3rd on a Summer Skirmish, among the hundreds of online tournaments he won collecting tens of thousands of dollars doing that. He inspired me, not to try and compete because truth is that I am ass (Still fuck you up in playgrounds, @ me bitch), but to be involved in the Esports and Comp scene of Fortnite. Thus I have been subbed to him for 7 months, shout out to the plug Amazon for twitch prime (bahaha)!

When you do something because you truly love it and love the process and not the thing at the end, only then will you be successful. I love talking about Fortnite. Too bad my significant other doesn’t. Neither do my friends or my parents. They couldn't care less. I love talking about it so much and need an outlet where there is a conversation, this is where Reddit comes in along with my twitter @Rpunzzl. If one person reads this and is entertained, I am happy. Fuck it, I am just happy just posting this even if nobody reads this but my goal is at one point everyone reads what I post! 

This post is not to promote anything or to say what state the competitive scene of Fortnite is in, but to tell you all how I became so immersed in the competitive side of Fortnite. I am learning more and more every day and I hope you guys enjoyed this because I will try and post articles daily in this subreddit going more into detail about specific aspects of the Comp scene and the streamers that compete! Let me know if you have any questions about anything you would like to ask me! I will reply to anything and everything! :)

The reason everyone is criticizing this gun is that they're trying to use it in a playstyle it wasn't built for. 

The pump, heavy, and even the tac are more fit for use from a close, but safe distance, taking shots from high ground or cover. 

Seeing how the rest of the shotguns are used best, everyone's trying to do that with the new shotgun and it just *doesn't work.*

Where this shotgun excels, though, is in a playstyle that I have a really bad habit of trying too often:

Get high ground, and then **dive** onto the enemy. 

This shotgun will win every fight that you just get as close as possible to the enemy, and get all your damage off right in their face.

Hi everyone!

I came up with the idea to post a stat sheet on all the weapons that show off some of the more basic stats and their ""Value"" in the slot.

How important is this gun that i'm holding? Is it as good as this other gun? That's the goal of this spreadsheet. I've only played a handful of scrims, but I enjoy watching pro scrims and the pro scene, so I decided to give my input on what is ""Best in Slot"".

#Feel free to debate anything you see and ~~lets keep the converstaion civil you monkies~~ let's not forget that everyone on this subreddit enjoys the comp scene and while we don't have to agree or respect their opinion, we should at the very least respect them.

I'm sure their are people out there with a much better insight to this than me so don't take this spreadsheet as fact simply because there is a spreadsheet that shows this opinion.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic, please read this.","I would like to take a minute to try something new here, and I want to see if this community is interested. The idea here is to run an open document where the community asks Epic questions regarding their balancing, intentions, clarifications, etc. If the community wants Epic to answer that question, then we upvote, if not then we leave it alone. Any unanswered upvoted questions will make its way into this original post in the form of an edit to shed light on it.

Multiple games in the past have done something along the lines of a State-of-the-Game (SOTG). Generally, SOTGs would involve multiple pros, and someone representing the development team. The pros would bounce questions, ideas, whatever it may be off of the dev and they attempt to answer them. It added a massive layer of transparency between the game developers and the community.

I want to be clear upfront; if this thread receives any large layer of toxicity then we may not see development presence, and if it gets too bad I’ll delete it as a whole. This is an open invitation to Epic to participate with the community, and the community to speak back. This isn’t an invitation for us to bash them. It will take a large sum of effort to ensure we word our opinions/statements/questions carefully, and with respect. I ask that you consider the possible benefits of something like this, and being able to communicate directly with the team. Moderators, if this thread pops off, I want to thank you in advance for the work ahead of you.

I opted NOT to do this in the Fortnite subreddit because I felt valuable, competitive feedback is what we wanted. Please don’t ask silly questions (skins, new content, off-topic, etc).

I have my pickaxe set to 1 and my weapons set to 23456. I'm having a lot of trouble switching weapons, what fingers do you use to switch and what are the best slots to have you weapons in? I've been running shotty first (2) into an smg or ar (3). I use my ring finger to hit (2) and my index/pointer finger to hit (3). 

I naturally keep my middle finger on W almost all of the time and i use it as a reference point for the number keys. Is this normal? I've seen people say things like ""w warrior"" seemingly poking fun at people that keep their finger on W all the time.

I'm also having a lot of trouble getting my hand back to the  ""home position"" after taking my hand away from WASD to do something that's in a different spot on the keyboard. I'm assuming this is just a muscle memory thing, but are there any tips to make this feel more natural?

I'm pretty good when it comes to the mouse, i feel like my aim is pretty on point. I have all of my building on the mouse. I'm using a razer deathadder 3.5 (dpi = 800, ingamesens= .08,.08) My building is set up to: 

Wall: thumb mouse 1 (top button)

Stair: thumb mouse 2 (bottom button)

Floor: mouse wheel down

Roof: mouse wheel up

I might as well include my other keybinds:

E = use/pickup

R = Reload

Space = Jump

Shift = crouch (using auto sprint)

Q is unbound ( i don't know what to use Q for)

F is edit (as im typing this i think that Q should be used for edit probably)

i think thats all of the important ones

I have 2 issues right now and would like to know on how to work on them:

During actual build fights I struggle keeping up with knowing where my enemy is, stressing out and giving up high ground fairly easy, I get stressed quick. How do I practice this routinely to get used to it?

In solos I die early a lot bs stuff, it seems like I always get some ammo or heals but no gun and the guy next to me melts me. It‘s tilting me hard. 

I‘m not used to do stupid mistakes and die to people that r worse than me because of myself. I shat on people in H1 for 1,5 years and now I get shit on haha.

I get that I‘m not extremely good at the game yet and it takes time but when you guys die in solos what do you do to not tilt off. I don’t have that problem in duos / squads.

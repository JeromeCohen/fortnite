At a dancefloor one of you massacred all of us dancing for no reason. I was getting a duck and get one pumped by you guys from behind. I got to a chest before you so you actively hunt me down. I shoot one bullet and you go from 999 wood to 1 in a split second. I'm having an intense shotgun, build, whatever type battle and you interject with a bullet to the head from 200 meters away. Can you guys calm down. I know its the nature of the game, but just have fun every once in a while. You're not pro. And even pros like Ninja, Myth, and Daequan all are relaxed and are having fun. 

PSA to all John Wicks, Calm the Fuck Down

He was younger (judging by his voice), but he wasn't annoying to play the game with. We *almost* won, and he joked about making a video that said ""I got carried by a girl in Fortnite""... I had 4 kills, he had 0 lmao

My focus has changed...,"So early in my Fortnite ""career"" I was focusing all my energy on trying to get wins. Playing mainly squads with some friends to learn the game, we managed to rack up a few, but we played slow, I would go through 70% of my early wins in squads with 0 kills in a team kill total of 6-11

As I slowly grew into the game, I was managing to get a kill a game in squads, so ventured into solos with the same slow burn mindset, taking my time, grabbing a single kill here and there, getting toward the end.

But now, winning is the least important thing to me about the game. I would rather get 5/6 kills and finish in a fast paced 50th over a slow burn top 2 with 1 or 2 kills. I mean, I've just started dropping into Dusty and Tilted vs outer areas and I'm loving it so much more! 

So I wondered what other peoples FIRST focus was when in a game (we'd obviously all love 15 kills and a win), is it making sure you get to the end? Or going in 100mph for kills and not caring where you finish?

Well i dont think people really want to see it being used to snipe people accurately as far as a sniper can, so why not just chop off the scope, lower the damage, increase the fire rate slighty, and make it a better close/mid range weapon??

Here is his POV on how winning should be more rewarding [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jgm1u/fortnite_is_getting_a_little_boring/?st=JH7A5S6R&amp;sh=

The way I see it, so much can be done to add to thrill of winning.

I want to win. I like the feeling. But it can be disappointing and a short lived excitement bc all you’re getting is a blue banner across your screen for maybe 30 seconds. For the people that haven’t won yet and want to win, keep busting your balls you’ll get it, and it is definitely rewarding!!!...At least at first. 

I have won a good amount of games, and I can honestly say if it wasn’t for my absurd drive to win it’s possible there wouldn’t be any satisfaction for me. They need to add something for the people that work hard to get good at this game (I started in season 2 and couldn’t even be considered “good” until 3, so a lot of effort was put in). I mean it doesn’t have to be anything THAT special. Epic is a company we get all of that, but along the lines of what u/Semiterrestrialsmoke said, I think there should be rewards for those that work for their wins. Maybe something above battle stars in the lobby screen? We can call them VR stars, victory stars, royale stars etc. and these would be used to purchase exclusive items from a separate item shop! Backblings, harvesters, sprays, emotes, maybe even skins!

Buuuuut, these stars are going to be a damn grind. And they should be! For ex: 1 star is for 1 win. To get an uncommon backbling let’s say is 40 VR stars. Maybe for elites this isn’t that much but 40 wins is gonna be a grind no matter how you slice it. Of course moving up in stars will be greater rewards and requirements in stars. Maybe an epic skin for 200 total season wins?!?! Another thing. If they are worried about making money, (lol they shouldn’t be) there’s a way they could make it so this store is battle pass exclusive, that way people are guaranteed to spend money at some point or another!

Think about how much people would want to get better at the game to earn an exclusive reward...Most everyone I’d say. This would grant even more competition. Another thing that is great about a potential system such as this is the fact that you can hold on to your stars to buy a different item at lets say 100 wins! So instead of buying that green backbling for 40 VR stars you save them up for a 100 VR star item! Well, you can aim high, but when the season is over you lose your stars and this separate item shop is reset along with the season. Or you can keep the items in the shop the same for a good amount of time (2 seasons?), and make that green backbling 100 stars and the 100 star reward something like 250! I think players would be happy with either direction. It’s a reward for winning. And We need this.

Epic could potentially lose a lot of players if something isn’t done to reward those that deserve it the most... the Omega upgrades was a start, but I along with everyone in this SR know they can take this more steps forward, to really give us more desire to win. 

TL;DR: Add a BP exclusive shop in the game that allows you to pay for items with stars earned from winning games. Short and sweet, but it’s juicer to read the whole post.

Reaching Tier 100 in the S3 BP was fun. I enjoyed the grind to hit 100 without purchasing the BP bundle (25 tier head-start) or buying tiers to reach 100. However, the reward and sense of achievement once I did it was a let-down.

Why? I hit Tier 100 around week 7-8. By that stage the appeal of the unique John Wick skin had well-and-truly worn off. After seeing John Wick's in-game since day 1 of the season, the skin felt common and aged. The Rust Lord meme was now the John Wick meme.

After reaching Tier 100 and unlocking John Wick, I've used the skin only once.

I'm starting to feel the same way again about S4. It's commonplace to see Omega's running around and I know the feeling of unlocking it after the grind will be the same anti-climax. A reward that doesn't feel new or unique.

The ""Unlockable Styles"" was a decent start to make the skins feel a bit more special, as they are upgraded based on real XP levelling rather than allowing you to skip ahead via microtransactions.

However, I still wish Fortnite had some form of rewards system which was a bit more difficult to grind and can't be cheesed by using V-Bucks or real money.

Now I'm not a top-level player by any stretch. I currently sit around a 5% win rate in solo, with a K/D around 2.5. But I feel I'm improving. It'd be great to have something to aim for which brings that sense of achievement that the BP is currently lacking.

Yes, there will always be casual players who can't possibly put in the time to reach Tier 100 without purchases or head-starts - and that's fine. However looking at how Destiny 2's loyal fanbase has abandoned the game due to Bungie catering to the casual player, I'd love to see Epic think of new ways to keep the game fresh for the more 'hardcore' player, and introduce new ways to keep them coming back.",FortNiteBR

Even though the game is fun, it is extremely broken. A good comparison to Fortnite would be MW2. The game is so much fun, but has many issue which limit a competitive scene. Like MW2 the game receives a lot of love and people are afraid to hate it or when they do, they just get shot down by sheep to this game. This mentality hides the issues which plagues this game. Two issues I can point out are lack of competitive game modes and RNG. The First is pretty obvious. Its next to impossible to find a game that has a competitive scene without an  competitive mode for a normal player to play. Call of duty had league play and CSGO has mm. Although Call of Duty is currently dead, It used to thrive during the BO2 era and League Play was one of those reasons. A mode where you’re ranked among other similar skill players is necessary in any game. I understand that some people don't care about a competitive scene in this game, but others including me want to play this game in competitive mode. The second issue which ruins a competitive scene is RNG. This issue is hard to fix without reworking the game, but I think EPIC should keep  casual game modes like they have right now and add ranked game modes with changes to the core game which makes the game more reliant on skill. First before I say what changes I think should be made to the competitive scene, I will like to explain the issue of RNG to people who don't understand it. RNG or random number generator is a bit of code in the game which decides all the random aspects to the game. These include what's in your chest, what weapons spawns, supply drops, storm place, etc. RNG should never be the reason someone dies. I remember i was watching Ninja at the start of the game got dropped by a no skin with a scar and ninja had a common pistol. Ninja looted half of L's in tilted and the no skin looted one room. Everyone was calling Ninja trash and overrated because he died. He didnt die because he was bad. He died because someone had better loot because they got LUCKY. They looted one room and got a scar and ninja looted three rooms and got a common pistol. People mistake luck for skill and called him terrible. Imagine if that was a competitive game with money on the line and the best player goes down at the start of the game because of a factor they can't control. I understand that in third party competitive services play multiple games to try to eliminate this issue, but the issue still remains. Now that I have explained the issue I will go ever what changes I know should happen.
Add a competitive mode: Like I said, it's a way for people be able to test out there skills in ranked environment and get placed in a league or Rank similar to csgo. If EPIC doesn't make this change, I hope a third party like Faceit or ESEA takes over. However these services require a small payment and some people aren't able to play. 
Note: All the following changes I think should be made in the hopefully added ranked game mode. 

Removing the RPG: The RPG is the best gun in the game. The reason why is you don't actually have to aim at a person to hit them. You could miss by like two feet and the splash will tag them down. The gun takes very little skill, but is high reward. It is because of this the RPG has no place in a competitive scene. 

Removing Silenced SMG, Minigun, LMG, and pistol: These Guns are all very bad. Like terrible to get. All they do is add more weapons so more RNG is in the game. There actually pointless. 
	
	Removing Loot Lamas: Again, it's lucky you find one and gives an advantage based of RNG. 

Increasing the amount of mats you get by 50%: This is just to speed up the game and keep it from being slow and boring.

Removing Med Pack and having Bandages be able to heal up to 100: No one likes 75 health, and the only way to get 100 back is to get lucky and get  a med pack. Thats RNG. 

Increase Chance of getting Minis, Big Shield, Chug, and Slurp by 15%: Shields are  great place for RNG. If someone has full health and full shield and you have 100 health 50 shield, you are automatically at a disadvantage because some got lucky and got shields and you didn't.   

Removing the All the craters and moon rocks: The craters are trash place to land and going dusty divoit is suicide. The moon rocks give one side a advantage because they can jump 500 feet in the air. They just aren't fit for a competitive scene.  

Shorting Tilted Towers: Removing Fish Brick, L’s, Garge, Trump, Paper Stand, and Grocery. So many people die at tilted and it makes the mid game long and boring. Shorting it will mean less players will land at tilted towers.

Removing the common and green AR and Burst: In H1Z1, there was only one gun. The M4. No Upper tier. Just the plain M4. Any gun fight you got in it would be even. It was more reliant on skill. I think the two lower tiers of AR’s add unescarry RNG to the game. 

	Increase chance to get Scars and Grenade launchers: To extremely powerful guns are hidden away from players through RNG. Increase the chance to get them will mean more players will have access to these weapons and even out the playing field. 

That's all the changes I recommend for a ranked mode. If you have any leave a comment.

I would like to briefly share with you my most recent and final experience with  this game. It was 50v50. I had two kills, which is big for me because I suck. There where only four left on the other team and I was so exited to see victory royal. But then I was knocked by a sniper but ended up in a safe spot within a fort. One of my team mates came up to me. I crawled towards him to revive me. 

But he did not.

He did an emote off brushing off his shoulders. He did that until I died. He did this... for what?
For fun? 
For my loot?
Why?

I know I am over reacting. But this was crawler then any game of thrones betrayal. This hurt me on a sociological level. 

This lead me to leave fortnite. I deleted it. And I won't be playing again because I can not believe some one would do this. 

I don't understand. 

I don't expect sympathy. Infact i expect the opposite now. Regardless I will not share his gamer tag.

We dropped from our bus, to find the weapons placed their by our scouts.  

I knew something was off. I could feel it in my guts.
And then, I saw it. The storm, as they call it. Chemical weapon from our own army. I hope I would never come to see it, but here I was. Purplish wall of death, killing everything on its path. And by killing, I don't mean instantly. It killed you slowly, so you would remember everything with remorse, your wife, your family, everything you knew and were supposed to fight for. 

My men saw it too. 

We were all falling to our doom. 
Some lost it, and decided to charge right in the middle of the enemy territory.

Goodbye, private R. Lord. Farewell, Jonesy, my friends. Slaughtered, you didn't even manage to touch the ground, that a bullet pierced your heart and took you both away. Colonel Wick ... You were good, son, real good. Maybe even the best. Yet, losing your brother in blood and in arms, you saw red. You had nothing but your pencil, surrounded by the enemy, you managed to kill two of them before going west. You will be missed.

We dropped at our respective locations. My team went to secure Tilted Tower, Havoc and his men were charged to clear Pleasant Park and join us at Dusty Divot, while Commander Trailblazer's team and herself would take care of the woods of Shifty Shaft, while some backup team, led by the Sub Commander, would harvest every ammo, weapons and other crucial items, in the little town of Greasy Grove.  

At least, that was the plan.

We lost Havoc only a few minutes after landing.
Poor man, he will never have a chance to see his newborn daughters.
Led by the Dark Knight, ruthless killing machine, with a flawless tactical mind, and as precise as one elite soldier can be, a commando took over Havoc and his men.
One by one, they were sent to the ground, lifeless.

Havoc was the last to die. Hidden inside a sellar, he sent a last message on our emergency line. ""It's ... it's over. I failed you. Tell my kids I ..."". The sentence got interrupted by a shot. Silenced followed. One silence so loud that my men, younglings sent to slaughter for the most part, were about to lose it. 
We had to move. The storm was coming, and we had no communication from Trailblazer.  

I gathered them next to the tower clock, and stood before them. 
""My sons ! My brothers in arms ! If we live or die is already in the hand of the God. He already knows if we supp with him tonight, so fear not. Fight well. And if you fall, surely Skull Trooper will take you to Canny Valley. 
You will see blood, death and fire. Some of you will die. We need to have each other back. Don't give up on your brothers. Leave your fear behind, and we'll get them"".  


They weren't the brightest, nor the best. But they were human, unlike that Dark Knight. They knew fear, but they also knew love, friendship, and courage. They cheered, raising their weapons to the sky, and dancing that cliché dance of the rookie. What a bunch of hoping bastards. They had no idea what they got into. Lucky for them.  

We decided to go meet Trailblazer. We lost a third of our forces, we couldn't rush like that.

What we saw when we got there stroke us. Fire. Blood puddles, guts on the trees, corpses hugging the cold dirt. All dead. All but one. I saw Trailblazer, on all four, coming our way, spitting blood. I ran to her side, only to hear her last breath. ""Ra...ven..."" .
My worst nightmare. He's the one who took my father, alongside my brothers. Faster than the wind, stealthier than a shadow, he was feared by all who ever heard his name.  

My men didn't hear that. No one dared to say a word, they were too scared and waited for me to help them. I wiped a tear from my eye, and got up. I couldn't talk. My mind was blinded by fear, anger and will of revenge. One scream was all I could let out. Not a fearful scream. But one full of rage, like the one you do when you step on a Lego. My men screamed as well, as they shared my pain and fear. 15 men, screaming, united, it's all it took to unleash the beast inside all of us.  

We had no mercy. We became the ruthless killing machines.

We first took over Salty Spring, killing two dozen and losing two. Private Royale Knight went down first, and her lover, Blue Squire, covered her body to try and help her. If not for this war, you were meant to be a nice couple.  
It only  fuelled our rage more.

On our way to the last part of this island that wasn't yet covered by the storm, we encountered the Dark Knight's commando. They probably didn't expect such a fight from us. They laughed, when they saw us.
My right-hand man, Battlehawk, didn't let them catch their breath, and before they could understand what was going on, he shot two of them in the head, sending them to the ground. 

A flash of fear appeared on the Knight's face. I decided to use that moment of weakness to rush him. I got over him, aim ... and shot. 9 damage.

Before I could realize, he turned around and shove his shotgun in my face. He had no face, yet I saw the delight he was having, ready to kill me, slowly pulling the trigger.
One shot craked the airs. My men were all around me, alive. The Knight's head flew to my feet. I couldn't believe it. My rookies defeated the commando, and were looking more determined than ever.  


On the radar, I saw we were in even forces. 13 against 13.
The enemy took position in Fatal Fields. What an ironic name, seing it that way.

I didn't give any order yet. I was watching them from behind a bush.
At that point, Brilliant Striker, the only girl alive in my crew, came at me. She really deserves that name. She, and 3 other soldiers, decided to hide inside bushes, to slowly get intel on the enemy.  

We waited the right moment. The silence was heavy on everyone.

One signal from Striker.

We took place all around the farm.

One other signal.

We attacked.

Twenty seconds, and they were dead. I couldn't believe my eyes. We defeated them. We were victorious. No one in our ranks died during this fight. We would all see our families.

It was over.  


Or so I thought. We were waiting to be teleported away from the storm, when we heared a call in the enemy's radio. A cold, dark voice, was laughing. Raven. 

""What a bunch of fouls. You, Rogue Agent, your men, the men you killed, including the infamous Dark Knight. Both governments sent you here to fight, yet they unleash their purplish death upon us. I am embracing it. You can't leave this hell with me alive. I'll embrace this storm as long as possible. See you in Hell.""


My men heared it this time. The calm and organized men that fought by my side minutes ago dissapeared.
They were scared. Lost. Sentenced to die by an unknow and unseen enemy. 

We watched the edge of the storm closing in on us.
They weren't listening to my orders, no matter how hard I would scream. I put some campfires, to try and help them. Pointless. I had so few bandages that I couldn't share with them. 

Then it started.

Battlehawk was the first one to fall.
Then Striker.
One by one, I saw my brothers taking their last breath.
They were young, went through Hell and back, to die the worst possible way.

As I was struggling to heal myself, with the storm burning my skin, going through my lungs, the Raven was laughing. An hysterical, scary, taunting laugh. I couldn't die like that. My men deserve to be remembered. I ... Can't ... Die ...

Then, everything went quiet. The laugh stopped. The storm didn't hurt me anymore. I failed them. I was the worst commander to ever exist. Suddendly, a drone flew to me, and took me out of this island. Everything was over. I won. The Raven was dead camping in the storm. We won.  My comrades will not be forgotten.


I still see and hear my friends, all succumbing to that chaos. Farewell, for you will always be in my heart.

This isn’t something that I’m necessarily blaming the game for, it’s just my opinion as of right now..

I’m pretty good at this game. I have a 15% win rate in solos since season 1, and in season 3 and 4 it averages out to a 23%. My main problem is that there isn’t the excitement or passion for wins anymore, besides trying to pad my stats. I know this is a thing with all BR games but Fortnite has been by far my favorite and I feel like they could fix this issue to extend its longevity by at least a bit more. 

Most games that have super long life spans are games that have long term goals built into them. Whether that be pushing for a competitive/pro status, gratifying long term rewards, rare achievements, etc. Now I get that Fortnite is a game genre that generally doesn’t have these kinds of things, I think that it would really make this game last longer if it did. Epic can make challenges that takes weeks or months to finally achieve, and you get super unique rewards. Or Have an ever changing meta, all competitive games have this, where one month a few weapons or locations are the best and then other months another set is better. Nothing gets more boring then dropping TT, retail, or greasy 20 games In a row. Or even a simpler fix would be to add small earnings for winning. Something that can stack up over a period of time to buy exclusive rewards, cool titles, and set yourself apart from everyone else. 

Tl:dr
I am a competitive gamer. That means doing good is what satisfies me as a gamer. As of now there isn’t any rush or excitement from doing good anymore and on top of that, there’s no reward for doing good like most games have, especially ones that are built for competition. Fortnite needs this to remain fulfilling for people like myself.",FortNiteBR

It is currently in its Alpha\-most stage \(THERE WILL BE BUGS\), but I do plan on it in my free time.

If you want to try it out, you can find it here:

 [http://battlepass\-companion.us\-east\-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/](http://battlepass-companion.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

Some Notes:

\- It should save any changes you make in your browser's local storage.  So it should persist on refreshing.

\- I do have some features coming in the very immediate future, including the ability to mark all challenges in a week Complete/Incomplete, as well as the ability to filter to only see Complete/Incomplete challenges.

\- If you encounter a bug, or would like to make a suggestion, feel free to PM me.

221,Homo3rectus,1526329074,8jfhys,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jfhys/improvement_to_building_on_console/,2,Improvement to Building on Console,"We all know that mastering the building mechanic is one of the most important steps to winning the game. We've all probably also seen that building on PC is a lot more fluid and controllable than it is on console. PC being the master race aside, there's a good reason for this.

1) HOTKEYS - On PC, each build piece (wall, platform, ramp, and triangle) is assigned a hotkey. Just like how PC players can switch from one weapon to another, they can also switch from one build piece to another without the need to scroll through the ones in between. This cuts time-to-build, but more importantly, it also gives players much more control over what they build. That's why it's rare for a decent PC player to accidentally build a platform or a triangle instead of a wall or a ramp, and vice versa. 

2) SOLUTION: So obviously, console players are at a big disadvantage. But I think this is a problem that can be solved easily. Just as how we can organize our inventory, we should also be able to organize the order of build pieces. As it stands, the game orders the build pieces like so: wall, platform, ramp, and triangle. 

This can be quite frustrating, as the wall and ramp are separated by that pesky platform. This makes it hard for us console players to build walls and ramps in rapid succession, because we need to scroll or cycle through what I like to call a ""buffer piece"" before we can build what we want. 

So I think the best solution would be to allow us to change the order of build pieces. Optimally, I would order it as: wall, ramp, platform, and triangle.


AT THE SAME TIME: Going even further, I think we should also be allowed to remove or ""drop"" certain build pieces. I find, for example, triangles to be absolutely useless. Actually, they're even worse than useless, because I can't even count how many times I've died (and seen other players die) because I built triangles instead of a wall or ramp. I don't see the functionality of triangles at all. I understand that they are meant to be used as a roof, but I've rarely ever needed to roof myself in. And when I do, I could simply use a platform. They work just fine as floors and ceilings.

Why can I do 80 damage headshot and the other headshot that is the same shot do 17 while some xbox tardo can auto aim me to death? 

Speaking of auto aim its quite clearly busted af. When ninja is saying ""how is he lasering me"" constantly there is a problem. Especially when you look at who killed you and they cant even move their character they are so bad. There aim isnt just magically good its auto aim. Ive played on controller in other games as well as other people I know who still do and think the auto aim is way too overtuned. You cant fight cross map against a controller player you lose every time inherently. 

Shooting through buildings. Constantly being spammed through buildings because the walls for some reason sometimes dont think they are up when they are. This happens to friends more than myself but does happen to me quite a fair bit. Pretty sure its a bug and a quite annoying one at that.

Rockets. Nerf ooga boogah damage on rockets and make it so they do more to structures instead of people. Monkeys shouldnt be using an rpg as a shotgun because its more useful or just be stationary spamming 30000 rockets because its the safest easiest thing to do ever. Its like playing mw2 again.

They did this I think I wouldnt complain ever. It would be of the best games of all time imo. Use to be a big oldschool cod and halo guy. Hope they dont drop the ball with this. They just need to tweak these few things and its like im playing those old masterpiece games again.

Bloom still decides who wins the gunfights and that feels pretty bad. Being behind someone should mean that you have the advantage but nope. 

You shoot the guy if you get lucky you'll hit two shots that just dealt MASSIVE 40 damage to him. Considering that he's on full shield and you're not means that you lost the gunfight.

So you decide to build some cover + some offensive ramps. You peek him to take a shot but he just lasers you and you die. Does anyone else feel like this?

It’s so hard to get experience and so frustrating. In all other shooters you learn by dying a hundred times and get better. First you get like 1 kill every 20 deaths and then 10 and you eventually get better. People on reddit told me to start practicing by going to Tilted towers so i get combat experience, like the jumping, shooting, looting, aiming etc. of course I’m dying a lot but what makes it really annoying and so tiring and time consuming is that while in other games you wait 3/7/10/15 seconds to Re spawn, here you die once, takes 10-15 seconds to go back to lobby, another 30 seconds to match make again, sit in launching lobby with other players for 10-20 seconds, then wait to get out of the bus. Fly down... then you can have another go its like a damn 2 minutes to respawn and try again, and in a high intensity game like this or any other shooter where you need to die and lose a hundred times to learn and get better, this  takes forever and is mad tedious, hell, even in games where you have to wait for the wait for rounds to end to respawn like CS or R6:siege, at least most rounds are shorter ( in my experience) than the time it takes to go back to lobby and join a new game and get your feet on the ground again in fortnite.

I know the main response is GIT GUD, yes i know. I don’t mind sucking, dying a ton and trying a hundred times again and eventually getting better like i have done in any new games, but when it takes so long to try again, it really breaks the flow and energy and makes it so hard for a beginner to get started",FortNiteBR

I was having a nice day about a week ago and decided to check my emails when I saw a gut wrenching message from Epic stating ""Thanks for your Purchase of 3,500 VBucks"", I did not make this purchase so I decided to check my bank account. Surely enough, 100 USD had been stolen from my account. I INSTANTLY cancelled my card and requested a new one. After setting up an investigation with my Bank, I decided to check my account purchase history in Fortnite, apparently whoever hacked the account has been attempting to buy Limited Editions, Vbucks... Anything they can over the last month!

Proof: https://imgur.com/eObtk7O

For the past few months I've been living on an extremely tight budget, so you can see that they failed to make transactions during March due to insufficient funds. But more recently, they succeeded after i received some pay! I'm scared nobody will believe me, but it wouldn't make sense for me to buy everything in the game, and then try to buy more! Why would I do that?! Why would anyone do that?! I've never given my password to anyone or any website claiming to distribute ""Free V-Bucks"" either.

I'm thinking that it's because I also use the same password on Patreon, which was compromised not so long ago. I can't be sure but it's the only thing that makes sense.

Epic PLEASE remove the ""Remember credit card details"" option from your in-game store, I've read so many other posts today from other people who have been hacked the same way. I have now set up 2 factor authentication so that this never happens to me again.

I will gladly admit that I'm not a good enough player to win on my own, but if I had a squad made of players about my level we would get wins every now and then.  The way the pairing system sets me up now, it's next to impossible for me to get a win.

I don't ask to get paired with Pros' every match or anything like that, but at the very least pair me every now and then with other players who are more serious about the game and paid money for it to give me a fair shot at getting a win.

I'll probably soon hear the obvious advises of ""get better"" and ""play with friends"".  I am getting better (slowly), and being ""older"" than most Fortniters I don't have many friends who play this game, let alone at any decent level.

Basically what this does is quickly move the aimer minuscule amount extremely quickly that it's unnoticeable while rapidly aiming down sight on and off which drags the aim over the head. This is causing people to be able to get Ninja like shooting with zero effort on their part. Products are being sold to exploit this and they're extremely popular on PlayStation 4. It seems like nowadays it's very hard to watch a game end and not see one of the top players utilizing this. Reporting so far has not seem to do much as you can easily track the same players and their videos seeing them constantly exploit using macro software that is undetected. I don't want to give too many details since I feel that it will just cause more people to do it. Really feel like the only solution for this problem is to completely disable auto aim in game across the board. It's no secret that console makes up a large portion of fortnite player base. We already know that epic is completely overwhelmed with reports. I really wish developers would just stop putting auto aim into games. It's entirely too easy for malicious users to exploit and there's no automated system that will detect it like it does on PC.,FortNiteBR

People are camping in the storm far away from the final zone with meds and campfires all game until the final zone closes in and kills the whole enemy team.

Easy fix:

The zone does more and more damage the further away you are from the final zone, there are circles around the final zone that increases storm damage to 20,30,40 etc the further you’re away from the final zone and in the storm.

So, if you’re outside the final zone in the storm, the storm does 20 damage per tick, if you’re in the zone the storm only does 10. The storm does more damage if you’re far away from the zone.

I’ve seen many posts complaining about this, and this is my suggestion for a fix. Another suggestion is that you fight fire with fire, if your team has 20 people alive vs ONE guy on the other team with meds chances are your team has ten times the meds of the one guy, use them! Don’t just sit there and die then complain here, place your own campfires and use your own meds! You’ll out-heal them easily.",FortNiteBR

Of course this whole statement doesn’t apply people who are streaming for fun or streaming because they want to make friends etc, this only applies to the people who are looking to “make it big” &amp; they think playing Fortnite is the only way to do that because it’s popular right now &amp; they want to try to become the next Ninja for example, but what they don’t realise is Ninja was already an established streamer before Fortnite but even so he started playing Fortnite when nobody was streaming it so he would always be high up in the directory etc plus he played so much to become the level he is now, which would be almost impossible for someone who just starting to learn now to do now because there’s too many people who are good at the game in each lobby now

I have determined that the issue does not lie within my own hardware, by trying a usb-ethernet adapter to make sure my Ethernet port was not faulty. The only solution I found to fix the issue of packet loss in my house was to use my iPhone as a HotSpot with AT&amp;T and voilà, my packet loss was gone. This led me to believe that the issue was either with my ISP or somewhere along my router-modem set up. I hard wired directly into the modem and still received packet loss. My ISP (COX Communications) came out this AM and told me everything looked good and that there were not a lot of connections to the outside line as well. I took my Desktop PC to a friends house who does not use COX as their ISP and again, I had no packet loss.

After this I thought maybe my Modem might be faulty. I replaced the COAX cable from the wall and tested at my house with a new modem from a friend of mine, and still received packet loss.

I have ran 'pathpings' 'pings' 'tracert' 'WinMTR' test, the whole nine yards and have spent 30+ hours testing to find out what the issue is.

I just moved into a new house on May 1 so I thought it might be an issue with the house wiring but like I said COX said everything is fine on their end and then I checked Fortnite Tracker to determine that I played games with no packet loss up until May 5th and that it wasn't until after the THANOS update last week that I started experiencing this issue.

I have my Fortnite Game Server Set to USWest and just noticed tonight via Network Resource Monitor that some of the Remote Address' that are shown for Fortnite are located in EUWest. So I am not sure if this is causing the problem?

My ISP is blaming it on Fortnites Amazon Servers, a tech guy said i'm having issues with Amazons Servers based on a WinMTR test I sent him and said that it is out of mine and my ISP hands.

I downloaded CS:GO to check my network to see if it was all games and there is 0% packet loss as well as with Overwatch.

I am looking for any help as to finding a solution since my 30+ hours and multiple attempts from knowledgeable friends have not been able to solve the issue.

If you have any advice please let me know as I'd greatly appreciate it and have not been able to find anything else on finding a solution.

I have reached out via support ticket to EpicGames earlier in the day to see if maybe they could identify the problem, but there was no option to chose ""connection or network"" issues, so I chose ""Login Issues""

tl;dr Packet Loss (out) started after Thanos update. ISP (Cox Communications) says everything on their end is fine. Only solution to fix packet loss is to use iPhone HotSpot AT&amp;T connection and or take my computer to my friends house who does not have COX.",FortNiteBR

Are you having trouble with inconsistency? 
Hit your shots and it wouldn’t be a problem 

They are not overpowered, or underpowered. The tac could use a little bit of tweaking to spread but otherwise they are not a problem. 

Other things people should be focused on 

Bullets going through building 

Building grid fucked 

Explosive weapons are STILL unbalanced and probably the biggest detriment to the game 

Weapon shots are still disappearing half way through the air/ or if you shoot and switch too fast 

EPIC DOES A FANTASTIC JOB AT LISTENING, but not if all they hear is bs about “my pump did nine damage” 

They already addressed shotguns. They made them over penetrated and prioritize headshots if other body parts in the way. If you get inconsistent damage, it’s cause you missed.

I'm not a game developer but I do play this game quite a bit and have been playing shooters for a long time. It really seems like the pump is one of, if not the most, imbalanced weapon early game. If you land on a blue pump, especially in a CQC type of area, you are in great position immediately. Most good players would immediately push the closest enemies because it should be an easy kill and one less threat.

As far as the damage and consistency of the shotguns go, because of the nature of the Heavy's spread.. it is arguably the most consistent shotgun IMO. It's damage is more consistent (typically won't hit a 6 or anything, but also less likely to hit a big shot like 220) and this makes it very balanced for an early game situation.

The pump, on the other hand, seems like a weapon that should come from chests/airdrops.. and be labeled rarity-wise accordingly, purple and gold. This would change the heavy to green and blue, which I think accurately reflects both weapons capabilities and viability. 

Pretending the blue pump is of an equal viability as the blue tac is not realistic.. I would argue a blue heavy would be far more comparable to a blue tac, where a pump realistically has a higher probability of killing a player in one shot.. thus it should be a higher rarity.

I also want to clarify, I DO NOT THINK THE PUMP IS OP, though there can be a conversation had about double-shotguns being a bit broken still.. What does everyone think? If you disagree please don't downvote, genuinely interested in opinions both for and against.",FortNiteBR

I feel a little bit like the explosive weapons could have a little room for more variety and something a little more common that's not hand-thrown, so I thought that the m79 Grenade Launcher a.k.a: The 'Thumper' (a.k.a: The Noob-Tube for you Modern Warfare 2 fans) would be a wonderful choice! 

Following stats have had very little thought put in, feel free to add 2 cents;

Rarity: Green/Blue (Maybe Grey/Green)

Damage: 85/95

Ammo Capacity: 1

Reload Time: 2-3 seconds

Grenades explode instantly on impact with objects and enemies, unless they hit objects or enemies within the blast radius of yourself, in which case it will deal the damage to the enemy without an explosion or it will bounce like a normal grenade launcher off walls and the floor and gain the fuse time of a normal grenade

Like I said, I didn't really think too hard about this, so please don't discard this idea because I wrote an underpowered or overpowered stat or overlooked something, add on to the idea untill it's something Epic might actually consider! ",FortNiteBR

That's crazy good. A bullet can hit your hand instead of your head while you're dancing.

Then there's the broken down houses with large holes in the wall where there is no sheetrock. You cannot shoot through those giant holes. And there's trying to throw a sticky grenade while poking from behind the right side of a wall. Not only are you right-handed, so your player is shown with their arm completely out of the way of the wall when it throws, but the trajectory marker *clearly* shows the path not hitting the wall. But it still does.


It's just interesting how vastly different the hit detection can be in different parts of the game.",FortNiteBR

I've played a lot of Fortnite over the last 8 months, what I loved about it was the fast paced gameplay, build battles and just how fresh the game felt. 

In my opinion snipers ruin this, they slow the game down massively, they punish people for playing aggressively (peaking and challenging players), and in a game where the intensity and excitement come from medium to close quarter fights sniping is an 'easy' way to earn kills.

I'm not saying that sniping takes no skill, but I've lost count of times in games where I'll be peaking to hit player A with an AR, whilst a random player B snipes you out of nowhere. 

I know they'll never take them out of the game, but id love it if even they could make a no sniper lobby - I feel the game would be far more enjoyable knowing you can't get randomly sniped. 

This will probably get a load of downvotes but meh,

I also have 550+ wins and a 6kd so I know what I'm doing but I just wanted to moan.

I hope this post helps others as well because I don’t want this to be all about me.

Now that I am getting higher up in points in the Gauntlet it seems like people are starting to spread out more and more and no matter where I land I am contested. My goal is to find dropping spots that aren’t contested or maybe one other person I need to contest. Because I’m not the best player I am looking for mobility and good rotation after the drop so that I am not running into multiple people early/mid-game. I don’t know the Northeast side of the map that well since the volcano change so maybe there are a few good places in this area?

Looking for spots similar to mini junk, super hero mansion (which I don’t like anymore), gas station near westworld, soccer… something smaller and just enough to get mats, a pump and an AR haha 

I did see ballatw say that the pirate house west of lazy lagoon is a nice spot. I’ll try that next. 

Any other suggestions? I’ll have more time to play these next couple days so it will be nice to try some spots out. Appreciate it!",FortniteCompetitive

Do you want long queue times, and at certain times of the day for top players, be unable to queue into games, or are you ok with filling into games with people of significantly different skill level. 

I've seen a lot of pros (and people on this subreddit) complain throughout both gauntlet tournaments. At first they complained that timmy.ttv was winning the gauntlet with 800 points and they keep getting bot lobbies, and now they're complaining about long queue times. Can we all just think for a second? Having the best of both worlds here simply IS NOT POSSIBLE. 

You gotta give Epic some credit. They knew this all along, and that's why they had popup cups at prime time hours. Now, I don't think limited time of day competitive playlists are the way to go - I think it should be 24/7. But we all have to realize at what cost this comes at. 

I think the system they have worked out is the perfect solution. Hold weekly ""tournaments"" where the first round lasts 5 days, which is a 24/7 event, then the player base is trimmed down into stages on the weekends, where there are 2+ time slots for each round. This is the ultimate competitive experience, and I can't think of a better solution honestly. 

I do have one critique, and I'm sure it's something they're working on. Personally, I would rather the 24/7 playlist be slightly less stringent than it currently is, such that true top tier play is only experienced on the weekends. I say this because I would rather wait 5-10 minutes for a good lobby rather than 10-20 minutes for a great lobby on the daily. But I think that it is vital that there is a cutoff as they have imposed, and the points range doesn't just expand indefinitely, otherwise people WILL abuse this, and purposefully queue into lobbies at 4 am when nobody is on. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Great top tier lobbies are not possible with short queue times, it just simply isn't, Gauntlet 24/7 playlist point range should be slightly reduced but not infinitely expand, top tier lobbies should only be expected to happen during prime time of each day/weekends, otherwise you're kidding yourself.

My aim is on point most of the times and my building is solid, nothing fancy but functional for the situation.

My biggest problem is tracking of enemies during fights and to identify the position of the sounds (for example if they're on my right, on my left or behind me).



-When I have high ground i don't know what to do because I have no clue where my opponent is, so I usually drop down to find him and so I find myself in bad spot to fight and I die.

- When I play low ground is a little bit easiest but if my opponent is a good player can sneak away.



In fact all times that I lose the line of sight i'm not able to find my opponent no more.

And this is worse in the open field when someone shoot at me from distance.

I'm not able to understand where the shots came and this is so frustrating.



I have resolved all this problems activating the accessibility option for deaf.

My game improved so much that I have played with no sound since season 7 but when I play solo is really damn boring.



So my question is: there's way, software for headphones or whatever that allows to hear and track enemies better? Because I have the impression that they always have an idea where I am, but I always have no clue.

They don't. It's always the players who are at a disadvantage and get outplayed who are the ones that resort to turtling, NEVER the player with the advantage. In ANY video game, the player with the disadvantage who is getting ""outplayed"" should be at a serious disadvantage and be extremely vulnerable, turtling is the EXACT opposite to that and in fact grants them invulnerability. Another issue with turtling is that it makes the TTK(time to kill) INSANELY high and gives another player the opportunity to come and third party the player who is trying to counter the turtler. What does the player who is turtling do when the counter turtle gets third partied? They instantly make a move and have the overall advantage after doing NOTHING but sitting inside of a box holding down one button. Turtling is the number one meta in the game right now and takes absolutely ZERO skill at all which makes no sense in a so called ""competitive"" game. The entire issue of turtling being overpowered stems from the introduction of turbo building, which allows players to spam build at a completely un-humanly speed just by holding down one button.﻿ ",FortniteCompetitive

To give perspective, I have dropped everything to become a professional player on fortnite. I went and bought a PS4 pro for only one purpose, Fortnite. From the end of summer to now ALL I've done from dawn to dusk is grind fortnite. I always felt like I was progressing. The Winter skirmish came and that was the first time I ever felt stuck. So I did everything I could and switched to pc. I play on pc with a custom controller. I warm up for 1 hour, play creative, play pubs, play scrims. EVERYDAY about 10-12 hours each day. I was watching footage, analyzing gameplay, taking tips, and grinding in-game awareness and mechanical skill. It came to the point in patch 7.40 where every turtle wars lobby, every 1v1, every skillful environment I was proving that I was leaps above anyone else. I proved that I could handle my own against established pros. Every lobby I got into people were blown away at how good I was performing. I promise like every lobby I had almost every player telling me how good I was. I felt like I was finally ready to make a stand in the competitive scene.

Then Season 8 came....i went into it cautiously optimistic feeling on top of the world in terms of skill. After facing pros and proving myself mechanically on par with players like 72hrs, Aydan, TurkeyLips; I knew I was ready to take on any competition. I had grinded 1000s of hours in scrims, creative deathmatch/turtle wars, 1v1s. I was ready. Then 8.0 came. Instantly I could tell it did not feel good. It got to the point where I concluded that the issues involving my performance were either my controllers fault or Epics. Because there's no way I go from being an amazing player to a sub-par average player in the span of a week from my own doing. I legitimately don't know where to go from here. I'm frustrated, sad, and depressed about this. Like i cant even hold my own against console players now. I lose to average players mostly now. I can point out the issues on Epics side of why I lose so many fights now. I feel helpless and every time I say something about it I get bashed on. I feel like I'm handicapped.

I'd never play like this on PlayStation maybe bc left analog was friendlier than WASD. I would get high ground instantly for some reason on PC I freeze and watch people out play me, it's so frustrating. My keybinds aren't the problem I'm very comfortable with them. If anyone could give me tips on how to initiate my building it would be great. When should I shoot? Build? What should I build? On PS4 I felt fluent but here I'm not really comfortable and don't know whether to shoot or build at times. I basically feel worse than ever.

My idea would be to change rocket launchers to be a limited use item, in much the same way that something like the grappler is (was). Make it so that when you find a rocket launcher it comes stock with 6 (for example) rockets, and once those 6 are fired the item is removed from your inventory and disappears. This would prevent scenarios such as firing all your own rockets then using the rockets your teammate is carrying, getting an elimination in zone and using all your rockets then grabbing the ones from your kill to keep firing. This would also add a level of strategy, risk/reward to the item; take a powerful item but that only has 6 shots, or use the slot for something else? As it currently stands rockets are too strong not to carry in all formats, competitive or otherwise. 

Feel free to leave feedback or thoughts, and thanks for taking the time to stop by. 

TL;DR: Make rockets be limited to 6 shots then they disappear from inventory (like grapplers). Adds risk/reward to item as to whether to carry or not, and maintains power without some of what makes it ""OP"".",FortniteCompetitive

You already know that Epic's priority is not optimizing the game for competitive play. Last I remembered, Fortnite plays on fucking 30 tick. That's HORRIFYINGLY low lmfao, and that alone should clue you in on how much of a shit they give about the performance of the game (not to mention that yea there are technical hurdles as well but you know EPIC would still prioritize releasing THE FLOSS PT. 2 over getting us 64 tick servers). Consoles are dead bro, nobody cares about your textures not rendering on Nintendo WII u or whatever. Buy a computer and stop complaining, nobody says you have to give up your controller.

I've seen a boatload of pros complaining about the inconsistencies of BR and it not being suitable for esports since it's hard to spectate, has too much RNG, duos and solos don't really make sense cuz orgs have at least 4 team members signed.
So maybe what we need to fix the esports scene by making a competitive 4v4 or 5v5 mode like most competitive shooters instead of the wacky BR, that way it's easier to watch, has a higher skill ceiling due to reduced RNG (more consistent results), and has more teamplay and strat variation.

Both of these systems are flawed and I think we need a more nuanced system as follows.

Right now it seems like epic isn’t using a percentage based system and they’re instead using a range of points system, which means if I get 20 points in one game and go from 40 points to 60, I go from having 10,000 people in my point range. To having 200 people in my point range which means realistically i won’t get into games. You can’t punish a player because for being the best/performing well, instead match them up with the best players, and give them less points proportionally vs. how well they do.

Here’s my suggestion
Top 100%-50% players get matched together
Top 49-25% matched together
Top 24-10% matched together
Top 9-5% matched together
Top 4-2% matched together
Top 1% matched together

From here Epic can introduce an Elo system that takes your total points gained/lost in a match and attaches a percentage increase to that based on the point average the lobby is. If I have 100 points and pubstomp a 20 pt lobby and get 16 points from it, i then receive 10 pts because I already have an insane amount of points higher than them. 

This is the system that League of legends has, and allows the GOATS to continue to play/practice, while also not allowing them to imbalance the economy of Elo points because they are shitting on players they’ve already shit on before.

*obviously this isn’t a perfect system because Epic doesn’t release all data to the public and I’m sure epic has smarter people than me (I hope PepePls) that can tailor this suggestion a bit better than I could come up with while getting my oil changed lol.

Now his point was that HD and Sypher (it was a Duo Gauntlet Cup Finals) fought with them under storm. The fight did start before the storm closed, but it did drag on for quite a while and in the end only HD survived out of the 2 duos.
He complained that they should dise gage and go for late gamepoints.

I'mnot gonna focus on what call would be the best, cause i dont have too much of a scrim/tournie experience. I just wanted to state some facts (well, the way i see them)
1. These ""content creators"" that dont scrim 24/7 because they find it boring have  QUITE MORE tournament experiernce and more earinngs (HD, Sypher, Daequan just to name a few that get a lot of stick for not being ""pros"") than aaall of these 16 y/o self pronounced competitive players who act like crybabies when somebody claps them in 1v1 or 2v2 combined. So caling HD ""4head, ooof these content creators"" is laughable.
2. People need to realise that an Esport needs to be popular and enjoyable to the audience. This whole circlejerk of ""no pushing and killing till late game"" is full Pepega and boring for the viewers (15 mins of turtling and 2 minutes of rapid action where you cant control who is where, who is alive etc). Seeing people go for kills, pushing and clapping each other is way more enjoyable and MY FIRM BELIEF is that the viewcount of the events will grow if more kill incentives are given so people will actually fight.
3. Just because you scrim a whole lot of time in a certain way, it doesnt mean that everyone has to play in this manner. I know it hurts when people with little scrim experience kill you abd it is suddenly all over for you, and I know it might harm both sides' late game chances, but it is way more fun for the player and for te viewer to see actual fights THAT NEED ACTUAL SKILL. At least way more than turtling till late game and then making some rotations in the late rng circles with 40 people in them.

I'd appreciate feedback.

Since this is only a test/qualifying event, I think players shouldn't have to wait a long time for a game. Therefore, a lot of players have been asking to revert the matchmaking to how it was before, with the max queue time being 8 minutes.

However, this leads to a problem. At calm moments (e.g. before noon), there are not enough players with higher amounts of points online to consistently get good lobbies. Let's for example take a guy who has 45 points. In order to get a max queue time of 8 minutes, he would have to get matched with players within a range of points somewhere from 20 to 70. The problem here is that there are a LOT more players with 20 points than players with 70 points. So he would be in lobbies with almost only players that have 20 - 30 points and only a couple players who actually have 40+ like himself. So he'd get an 'easy' lobby. However, a guy with 45 points that plays in the evening would get a lobby full of people with around 45 points, making it significantly harder.

So it's either an 'unfair' matchmaking, granting an advantage to players who play at less busy times of the day, or long queue times. This is especially true for servers with less players (i.e. OCE). Top-tier players in these regions could easily abuse the matchmaking system and farm bad players to get high points. Since the leaderboards are worldwide, this creates an unbalance in the leaderboards, putting EU and NAE at a serious disadvantage. This is probably why Epic has implemented matchmaking the way they did now. 

I however strongly disagree with this. These are just test events and the top 3% players qualify. Not a single top-tier player who has a shot at actually advancing into further rounds of the tournaments struggles to get into top 3%, wether they play in the evening or before noon. Therefore, I think they should just revert the match making to how it was, with the limit being 8 minutes. This will indeed result in an 'unfair' matchmaking, but I think a 24/7 ranked system with a 100% fair matchmaking in a BR game with 100 players in each lobby is just impossible. As long as they fix certain time slots for further rounds so that matchmaking is fair in these further rounds, I think this is the best solution Epic can come up with.",FortniteCompetitive

i personally like the point system until i see the kill points it’s stupid 

another thing they should change the way the queing works if you don’t get into a game full of the same points around you after 20 mins they should try getting the next point division like just drop 10 points not you’re self but the q’ing standards drop 10 points to get into a game that isn’t to far off of yours

29 year old guy who started playing in season 6 and doesn't have a lot of time to play. I work, live with gf and have all the gown up responsibilities.

Been a gamer all my life (mostly cs, professionally for some years)

This season I'm on 4.64 avg KD. Current solo cup have 6 matches and 38 points (2 victory royales). I consider myself above average and had really solid evolution till now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**knowing your weaknesses and strengths.**

I knew my aim wasn't a problem since I played overall 12k hours of cs since 2001, so that was my strength as soon as I got into the game. Season 6 was my ""casual"" season. Learning the mechanics, etc. In season 7 I decided I wanted to get good!

My weaknesses where definitely my building and game sense. So I literally spent 2 weeks, 3/4h a day playing ONLY creative. Either learning new building strats, practising edits or playing turtle wars. [Videos like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_LqtyAxGWg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR054_rumfah5UBqRYHvVtrT-pNnhoNV4pqU_xGXWIbD2UGObh9M-vT103U) help a lot because they would just remind me of strats I might have missed.

Every time I see a new strat in this reddit I jump into creative and as soon as I get home and try to master it.

&amp;#x200B;

**having fun vs practising.**

Most of part-time players want to get good and enjoy their playtime at the same time. Unfortunately imo that's not possible. Most of my close friends I play with started playing early in the game and literally nothing changed since I play with them. But then they complain when they get rekt by a better player. Then comes the classic ""Look at this no lifer sweaty try hard"".

Well I got news for you: You can get to the ""sweaty try hard"" level without being no lifer. It's just the way you practise. You need to ditch your squad for the night to practice? Do it.

If you have no time to grind, you should use ALL your time to get good FIRST. Then jump into games and TRY HARD. After that is when you'll start enjoying the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**analysing your plays.**

One thing it changed in my mentality was not blaming the 3rd party or the ""stupid"" enemy decision but to evaluate my decisions. What could I've done better, what did I did wrong, did I over build or did I play too passive.

Just analyse your replays guys. It's literally 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: you can get good at the game without playing everyday for 8 hours. It's all about the way you plan your practices and your mentality.",FortniteCompetitive

154,Bofijo,1552468958,b0jxfa,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b0jxfa/tfue_one_of_the_best_at_decision_making/,1,"Tfue, one of the best at decision making ?","I'm here to discuss about decision making. I'll take Tfue as an example. I've read many threads about him and why he is so good. It seems that everybody agree that his mechanics are super good but not the best, and he decision making is god tier !

I watch a little bit of his stream yesterday and I don't know what to feel about it. FYI, he was playing duo gauntlet with 100T Kenith. Here are some examples.

He decide to push a team early game by taking them under guard, manage to kill them pretty easily. Smart. Then they were in trouble with low mats and low health, he manage all their rotation to take low risk an luckily find a solo player and kill him. Smart rotation and push. They go Paradise, take one building. Tfue ask Kenith to spray a wall and push a team with boggy bombs ! Really smart push, they kill one guy of the team, the other one was low but was able to leave the fight. At this point they were full mats and almost full health if I remember correctly. This was a pretty good game considering their situation 10 min ago. 

They get tagged white just before the first moving circle while rotating. Kenith give Tfue one mini : if he only had one, he now have an empty slot ; if he had more, why not give him two ? I do think he only had one. The moving circle his far from them, but they have like 2000 mats combined. Then (my opinion), really really bad call from Tfue two times in a row. He ask Kenith if he had launch pad or redeploy to go further without using mats (and exposing themself really hard btw). Kenith : ""no"". But Tfue could split redeploy (he had ten) because Kenith had an empty slot... But that's not it, Tfue decide to literally play solo and redeploy to the next circle, leaving Kenith \~100m behind. Of course he gets laserd, he was kinda low ground considering of the natural ground. Kenith was now solo and gets logically killed easily.

I was like ""why ???"". It lowkey feels like he give up the game. I don't know how he could manage to play this well all the game and literally play his own at this moment of the game ! They've had all the mats they need to go to the next zone, and maybe manage to kill someone during this ! 

I'm not here to spread hate against him, don't get it mistaken ! 

How often does this moments of lack of clear thinking happen to other guys ? Is it a common thing ? Are they aware that a play was dumb ? I've already see streamers talk at the end of a game and discuss of how they could play better, but never blame the other player directly. 

I'm also aware that it's way easier for me who is behind my phone to think of all this stuff than players who are in the action ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank's for reading, this is a post to discuss about decision making amoung pro players. I've take this Tfue example because it happened yesterday and because he his known for that (partly).",FortniteCompetitive
155,PaintDry-,1552460990,b0j13t,58,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b0j13t/the_hamster_ball_is_overpowered/,9,The Hamster Ball is Overpowered.,"I don’t say this like streamers say it about every new item added. The baller is genuinely overpowered.

It is the only vehicle throughout the game that has no risk to using. You cannot take damage from any angle, you can travel incredibly fast, and can damage opponents by ramming into them. 
You can only take damage if you someone destroys your baller and hits you immediately after, though it’s as if people wouldn’t build immediate after it being destroyed.

It’s funny how desperate Epic were to remove turtling, via allowing enemies to edit your walls, explosive damage through structures, clingers, planes and so on, yet added a version of a turtling that allows you to traverse the map at speeds that rival the quadcrasher. 

Can you name any other game, that will have 100 pro level players sitting in bloody hamster balls doing nothing during a WORLD CUP.  These additions to the game keep getting out of hand. Epic need to take a good long look at the destruction they are causing in the competitive and casual scene.

I suggest vaulting it from pop up cups, and nerfing it’s health in public matches, otherwise endgame just won’t be as fun as it used to be.",FortniteCompetitive

I’m pretty good on console, I can get a couple high kill games a day but the competition is lacking and everything feels delayed. My game is regularly at like 30 fps and my edits rarely go through.

Do you guys think I should switch to a pc and 144hz monitor with controller, and if I don’t feel much improvement, I should switch to keyboard? 

I ask this because people make it seem like pc, even with a controller is a huge difference. When I watched console youtubers who switch to pc with controller, they seemed decent on console but their edits and shots and builds look so much better once they switch to pc.

182,durpdurppurppurp,1552438754,b0fr19,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b0fr19/the_new_baller_is_op_for_rotations_it_is/,0,"The new baller is OP for rotations, it is everywhere end game - proposed nerf","First off, like everyone, I'm really happy planes are gone. Most vehicles in this game are now both practical for rotations and balanced, starting with the hoverboard. However the new baller is not one of them. It is extremely fun to use, especially in regular public matches, but very OP for competitive. Perhaps even more than planes although in a very different way.

What follows is particularly true for solos, but I'm sure it is the case for duos to a lesser extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Play the gauntlet mode and you'll literally see 10+ of them end game. The fact you can't be hit when inside it gives you free rotations until the second moving zone easily, if you manage to box it in with you in between zones. It's also very silent, so practical for rotations early-mid game too. You can usually get the best position in zone 2-3-4 with very little effort considering how fast it is.

It's possible to retake height, climb mountains with it... I'm sure in the next few days people will find ways to optimize the boost/grapple timing to make it even more reliable

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, its collision is a bit buggy and the baller can somehow phase completely through walls or floors if you edit another structure near it but that's not even touching it. Annoying when you're boxed in with yours late game and it just suddenly disappears out of your box

&amp;#x200B;

Considering how OP it is, it is however good that there is an abundance of baller spawns: at least it makes there is RNG for who has one and who doesn't end game. You can indeed plan your rotations to get your hands on one with certainty if you wish to

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not completely sure what changes could be done to the baller, but I believe some sort of nerf is necessary.

Maybe reduce its health to 50hp instead of 300? Make it much slower? Make it break when you try to build around it, so you can box it in with you?

I either pump the guy and switch to my AK, or, pump the guy, try and build and panic, causing all sorts of confusion (for myself), and end up trying to figure out why I'm not shooting (usually still in build mode or am holding a some sort of healing/grenade that's on the opposite side of my load out than my weapons).

On the other hand, they are stupidly OP when used safely from a turtle window, you can die pretty much instantly in an end game situation by having your foot exposed for one second and 3 players start lasering you from boxes 100m away. This current AR design is terrible and completely promotes turtling.

On the other hand, I recently had to use the infantry rifles late game during the test event because I couldn't find an AR. Even though they are clearly inferior to Assault Rifles in every way, these things feel so good to use: landing hits and getting kills is super satisfying, you can stay mobile while using them, it feels skillfull and rewarding.

If there were no more ARs but only variations of the hunting rifle the game would be great: completely bloomless, skillfull ranged fights. If we could get a version with a bigger clip for example, these things could completely replace regular hitscan ARs and fortnite range combat would finally be interesting. ",FortniteCompetitive

There is almost nothing Epic can do, the hardware just isn't there. I don't think there has ever been a graphics slider for any console game (Correct me if i'm wrong) so don't expect epic to make one. The barrier into PC gaming is also at an all time low.

they're probably planning to put that leaked weapon in the Epic, Legendary slot as an equivalent to the AK.

&amp;#x200B;

although the leaks say this is similar to the infantry rifle, I think Epic might've reconsidered after they saw the feedback on how the infantry is very underpowered and put this new weapon as an upgraded AK instead.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes sense, think about it. They put the infantry as an option of an AR instead of the burst, it failed, and their solution is to give that role to the AK and give it another varient to fill all the rarities. an AK would do much better than the burst and the infantry in being a second option to the AR.

This season however, I dont know what it is or how the level of the average lobby has peaked all of a sudden, it's become ridiculously hard for even the good players to win consistently.

For me, I've had to play every game like it was a scrim. Mat up, loot way more than I've ever had to, and play for end game. Jump pads and rifts have never been as useful in a pub.

I enjoy the competition, it makes me play at my best, rather than making silly mistakes trying to get that 20 bomb, I have to be smart about every play that I make.

There's a flipside though, what about the casual players and the people who aren't maybe as mechanically skilled as whats required to compete in these lobbies? 

Would a ranked mode solve the problem, so that the better players can compete together and so can the lower skilled guys?

I don't think them sticking to Ltms is good for the games longevity.. an LTM win is nowhere near as rewarding as a hard fought out solo.

You will never fucking get better at this game, if this the shit you play all day. If you want to get better play core modes. It doesn't have to be fucking solo. Like, I understand you're having fun. But you learn legit little to nothing from killing bots.

Like playing core modes, teaches you how to use your fucking head how to rotate around the map. Look at the mini map of when to move when the storm is coming. Know when it's safe to rush people and assess situations depending how confident you are on your skill.

Team Rumble teaches butt fuck absolutely none of that. Other than WoW i GoT BeTtEr At AiMiNg. Yeah, obviously. Rushing in fucking like a dumb ass all the time, respawning after isn't making you better.

What fucking annoys me the most is how long this god damn fucking mode has been out. We need something fucking new already for Large Teams. Like teams of 33. But no, fucking bots need their respawn and dumb ass epic always cater these bots.

TL;DR You will never get better if all you play is TR. If you think you are, you're not. Go fucking play a core mode, see how long you last. Your brain knows nothing but respawns because how much you suck at the fucking game.


The day, they stop respawn modes is the day I send back all these fucking bots to the lobby. You think you're good killing people with that fucking .2 - .5kd? Come into a core mode, fuckwit. My sorry fucking ass 1.3 KD is already above average than most players. How fucking depressing.

The Deagle was a gun that was not for everyone it actually required a higher skill to use than the Smg to hit shots in addition to it breaking wooden structures to quick counter camping in 1 by 1's this made it a viable option to the Smg and helped make the current Meta somewhat flexible. There was a nice variety between players using the Pump Smg and the Pump deagle. Epic should have left it just as it was or nerfed its damaged to structures solely  based on distance. If you noticed someone using the Deagle combo you switched material to help or just change your mindset to combat that. But some pro players and members of this community bitched about it disregarding the fact that it was easily counted if you had the wits and brain to do so, it got nerfed incorrectly and now we are back to spray and pray (which IMO is very inelegant, ungraceful, unclean and overall lacking of an advanced level of skill). In the current meta now there's no variety what so ever and the same pro players and community members who bitched are at it complaining again. P.S I don't hate the Smg's or their users, I just preferred the Deagle in its old state or with a Nerf similar to the one stated above. To each his own in the Pump Smg or Pump Deagle option but in the state it is currently Its irrational to take the Deagle over the Smg. ",FortniteCompetitive

I just recently switched to PC from Xbox and I just want to get better. This was in the second round of the Duo Gauntlet finals.

Using Placements from TC,Pax, and ESL, I will determine a rough draft on how many player each region should send. No

Important Notes:  I will not be counting any people not in the grand final. ""Placements"" are determined for players who got more money than just qualifying. (In Pax and TC teams got money for just getting to grandfinal, but I am not counting those teams)

Part 1:PAX

Pax was a NA tourney. The grandfinal had 8 EU players and 92 Na players. Money was awarded up to 20th.The EU placements were 12th and 19th.  

Prize Money Na: 1,625,000   Per Person: 17,663

Prize Money Eu: 51,250         Per Person: 6,406

Part 2:TwitchCon

TC was a NA tourney. The grandfinal had 8 EU teams, 3 mixed teams, and 39 NA teams. The EU placements were 7th and 18th. No mixed teams placed. (for mixed prize money, split.)

Na Prize Money: 1,727,500   Per Person: 21,327

Eu Prize Money: 215,00         Per Person: 11,315

Part 3: ESL Katowice(duos)

This is the first tourney to be in Europe and have international players. There were 9 NA teams,1 OCE team,1 South American Team, 4 Asian teams, and 35 EU teams. 

NA: 1st,3rd,4th,7th

EU:2nd,5th,6th,8-20th. 

Other regions didn't place

ESL Katowice (Solos)

NA:1st,4th,6th,7th,17th,19th

EU:2-3,5th,8-10,12-16,18th,20th

South America:11th

OCE and Asian teams didn't place

TOTAL PRIZE MONEY FOR ESL

SOLOS:

NA: 40,000 Per Player: 2,222

EU: 54,000 Per Player: 771

OCE: 0

ASIA: 0

SOUTH AMERICA: 2,000 Per Player: 1,000

DUOS:

NA: 176,000 Per Team:19,555

EU: 224,000 Per Team: 6,400

OCE: 0

ASIA: 0

SOUTH AMERICA: 0

CONCLUSION:  
NA dominates Pax and TC in ever category, and dominate at ESL too. Comment what you think the ratios should be for Worlds!!!",FortniteCompetitive

•I’m talking about audio-
 
When you spraying AR shots you cannot hear anything else. 
When people glide, you legit can’t hear where are are they. Seems like they are in every place.
Vertical audio still needs fixes.

•I’m talking about Console performance-

It feels so slow and off.
When the game requires high speed rendering/pace or anything else it becomes just bad.
Sensibilities just don’t feel good.
Buildings not rendering on time at first drop.
Not to mention all the bugged small things.

•I’m talking about shots not registering-

We all know what this is, since what? Two seasons? You legit can point blank shot someone and your shot does not do any damage but of course you have hit markers.

•I’m talking about builds not placing-

Turbo build is so bad sometimes. You can spam walls or anything to protect yourself from sprays and shots still go through. Not to mention people facing them too. Even when you build a quick one by one sometimes pieces don’t place.

•I’m talking about big boy lag at final zones-

Servers cannot afford 30plus players in last zones. That’s why storm surge (which is honestly dumb) exists. Players shouldn’t get punished for lag issues that epic can’t fix. Not to count random ping peaks that you get in fights that make you fall to your death or anything else.

I don’t know how many times players need to ask for a fix. Just stop adding things that no body asked for and start addressing all of these performance issues. 

Imagine playing the game not for fun, playing it for a lot of price money formally and losing because one of these issues. Make the world cup something actually playable for a professional level.

I spent the last few weeks grinding the game, literally maybe 1-2 hours a day, everyday. It's not that long. I played edit courses, actual games and created my own scenarios to work on. Once again 1-2 hours a day.

I kept this up day in day out and eventually I was getting as low as 4 minutes on Mongraals edit course, which obviously isn't the best, but it's quite low for someone who isn't very good at the game. All you need to do is put in some long term goals and effort.

These 'sweats/tryhards' are people who put effort into the game and they are people who actually want to win (which is the objective). If I, a really bad player can do this, then an average player can easily do this. it's literally just effort.

The Revolver and IR obviously have high damage balanced with small mags, but are both worse than the AK by several magnitudes. A better fix would be to vault all of these weapons, save one, which would be given a mag of 12 rounds and do damage equal to the IR. It could have a scope and have projectile mechanics, though they should be sped up from the current IR's dreadfully slow travel time. This will improve the loot pool while not depriving people of these weapons' niche.",FortniteCompetitive

No customs and even if there were, we would have to pay to get in, no scrim discords want to do solo scrims and will go off their schedule to avoid them. Anyone know if theres another event or any discords that prioritize solos as much as duos? I think pop ups should be scheduled 24/7 with same point system.

&amp;#x200B;

Also sucks that qualifiers and grand finals was in the same day. I could only play for 3-4 hours which was spent in the first session and I qualified. I went 4 games without getting any points or at max 1 and still managed to qualify. Hope Epic brings another practice event and doesnt put qualifiers and finals in the same day, missed out on playing against really good players in East. :(",FortniteCompetitive

Tfue said fuck it and duel’d him formally. The guy one pumped Tfue for the win. Tfue checked the replay, saw that he didn’t have TTV in his name, added him and proceeded to 1v1 him in creative.

The guy won the best of approximately 15 fights, just by a couple. Many of these fights went to sky limit, so there’s that.

Do you guys think it was bad that Tfue, in a way, rewarded the stream snipe? If this catches on, it could get bad for big streamers.

Or

Do you guys think it was cool that Tfue did this? The guy set up a clean 1v1 in the stream snipe and wasn’t self promoting. He has clearly put a lot into this game, and Tfue gave him a chance to show what he’s got and maybe get some looks in the competitive scene.

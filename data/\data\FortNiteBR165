But now, regardless of which side of that split you fall on, the split exists and will continue to exist. Half the players prefer the game in a different state to whatever state it is in at the time.

This games current state is trash, the most complete stage of the games life was season 4 with building not being absolutely the main meta and double shotguns and shotgun smg being meta.

I dont understand how this game still has 8.3 million players yet all of the games are ruined but sweaty players who don’t leave their house only to buy cans of redbull and streamers who entertain the fanbase but are also being ruined by stream snipers.

The addition of unnecessary items such as balloons and grapplers has made it pointless to try gain the height advantage and the most pointless removal of bouncers caused people to use grapplers which require no skill to use.

This game is seeming to return to a better state in recent times but season 5 was the worst state for fortnite with SMGs being the only viable way to kill people.

I respect epic games for understanding the problems with the games meta and trying to balance it but i feel if epic was to bring back double shotgun and bouncers, vault p90 and replace with the tac smg and remove the grapplers the game will be at its best.

Just my thoughts but the way the game has been going recently jt is starting to show signs that we are getting to the post honeymoon stage of the games relevance.

Maybe doing a matchmaking system like CSGO would be good. However there not being an elo but putting players into games with similar Victory royales, games played and kills and that being the ranked and players have to verify their account via phone number and there being an unranked matchmaking for players who haven’t verified their accounts.",FortNiteBR

Hear me out and discuss!,"First of all I understand the community is split against this debate. I understand the reasoning for people wanting redeploy gone. I agree that having it caused some issues but that doesn’t mean we can’t have something a little in between.

My suggestion is to add a cool down to redeploy, yes a cool down, but let’s look into that. The problem with redeploy was people saying it lowered the skill gap or too much 3rd partying. Well, let’s say we give it a 30 second cool down starting once you’ve used it last (includes jumping from the bus). If you are in a fight, let’s say duos, and you just cleaned up the kill. You’ve probably taken some damage because this was a tough one. As soon as it’s over you hear 2 guys swooping in so you build up your tower and look around. They land and immediately start rocketing you. So you do the best thing and glide away. The team still has their sights on you so they begin to snipe since they cannot glide again. You can now proceed to heal fast because guess what they probably have 10 or so seconds before they can glide again and you’ve got 30. So heal up and here comes the next fight. 

Don’t criticize, this is just a suggestion I thought of driving home from work. I think it would be interesting to test it out and would be cool to always have some kind of ability at your disposal but you need to be strategic with it, think Overwatch cool downs. ",FortNiteBR

My bone marrow stopped producing red or white blood cells and platelets, so essentially i was not making anything new to keep my body going. At my lowest point had i cut myself shaving it could have been a life or death scenario, it caused a lot of problems for my body, hell i had a nose bleed that turned int oa 5-6 hour ordeal.. I ended up having to quit my job, stay with family and pretty much live in isolation for months due to my immune system being so weak a common cold could have killed me. Right about the time everything was in full swing, meeting with my doctors, coming up with a treatment plan and all the scary realities that brought, i ended up in a very dark and sad place, all the what ifs and scary paths that laid ahead of me had me pretty depressed.. Well about this time i found this game back in season 1, and man was it a ton of fun. Having all the time in the world to myself and not be able to do anything other then game, i spent a lot of my time on this game, and it ended up helping me cope. I can say through some of the darkest times this past year, i was able to hop on this game, and leave my reality for a little bit, and actually be happy and having fun. I got to play with friends and make new ones along the way, take part in this community (which may not always be on the same page but still has its good times) and just enjoy my time. I am very thankful to have been able to play this game, because i don't know how things would have turned out if i didn't have it to turn to in my saddest times, So thank you Epic.
The story ends on a positive note, I am actually doing amazingly right now, my treatment has been doing really well (Doc said it is probably because i am so much younger then the normal person going through this treatment that it worked so well/quickly) and i actually start my first job in forever in less then a week.

If someone runs from a fight follow him, shoot him idk.

Or why not just make a separate mode? It was so fun, now you cant even rush people without getting shot at with a turret.

I know for a fact that there's people who've spend a lot more than me, but I still feel like spending money on a free game is stupid - but the truth is: I was addicted like everybody else who spends tons and tons of money on skins.    


The game was really great at the beginning, but in my opinion slowly started to become tilting. Dying to stupid stuff that could've easily been avoided if a staircase wouldn't have placed itself under the ground, the bloom, the RNG weapon damage etc.   
**I ask you:** Have you ever died in Fortnite where you sit back, speechless and thinking: ***""Uhh, what?""*** \- yeah, I got that a lot and decided to quit. I came back recently to try it out again, and I rarely died without the ""uhh, what?"" reaction.   And before any of you tell me to ""git gud"", I average around 5-8 kills - well, the games I don't die right off the bat because I don't get a weapon first that is. My kill record is 13 kills if anyone was wondering. Of course, it's not god-tier, but it's not a trash player either who doesn't know what he's talking about if you feel me?   


**The weapons**  
As of me writing, a turret has been added. Like, what? What for? They removed the revolver only to add another revolver almost just like it. I don't know if it's Fortnite trying to make a little **Red Dead Redemption 2** Easter egg or what. Adding the double barrel shotgun for no reason whatsoever, and making it so overpowered - I know, they nerfed it and made it unusable, so why add it in the first place? It's worth adding, that when they added this shotgun, all shotguns was in a really bad place, so instead of fixing that.. well they just add another one which just wasn't what was needed.  
They remove double pump, which was the closest Fortnite ever got to having a good and reliable meta where there actually was a skill-gap between players. Now, it's **""Shotgun shot switch to SMG and spray""**   
I don't even wanna mention the drum gun, it spoke for itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I feel like it's starting to get old about the whole ***""Oh no, what's gonna happen next?""*** with the cube thingy. Remember back in season 4 when **The Visitor** made a portal to escape from the Fortnite planet. Honestly, that was a really cool event and I witnessed it myself. Now, that was season 4. It's now season 6 and what he did is *STILL* a thing. The Cube came because of him, the Enforcers, the zombies (let's not even begin on the zombies). ***Also, it took most of season 5 with just the Cube rolling around the map!*** \- how interesting am I right? Season 6 is here, and loot lake has now.. what? exploded and people got sucked into another dimension. **My point is:** *WHEN WILL IT GOD DAMN END ALREADY?* I haven't enjoyed Fortnite since season 3-4 when it was actually good and I'm so disappointed and sad that it's not the way I hoped it would turn out to be.  


Anyways, enough of my rambling. What's you guys' opinion on the matter? Am I just a salty scrub who doesn't like the game and should git gud, or do I actually have some valid reasons here? ***Thoughts?***  


**Oh, and by the way this is my first Reddit post ever, so please be kind. It took me quite a while to write this. By the way, I'm not from an English speaking country, so if there's any misspelling or something like that it's probably why.**  


**Have a nice day :)**

 Leviathan Bundle 

 Highland Warrior Bundle

When Glider Redeployment was implemented into the game I thought it was going to stay since it gave a fresh new meta into the game while allowing us to land on the outer parts of the map, having a more aggressive play-style and let us have a fair end game. Epic Games decided to make one of the worst decisions in the history of Fortnite and straight up delete GR from 3 most played gamemodes. Without GR landing on the outer areas of the map like the mexican villages/factories north of Flush Factory and even Risky Reels is just an unviable option for players since most of the times the spawns far away from these areas which also everytime takes away the ability to fully loot the place and farm enough mats for the late game build fights. GR allowed players to play even more aggressively than they played before the implementation of GR. Now without it traveling around the maps takes longer and build fights are truly useless since a random Bystender could knock it down with a couple of shots and get two birds with one stone. End Game has also changed dramatically without GR since high builds and bridges are so crucial in endgame yet now they are just useless without gliding. 
Now some people may say “I gEt 3Rd PaRtIeD eVeRy GaMe” Yes this is true with GR in the game 3rd Partying was more common than now but saying that you get 3rd Partied while ignoring the fact that you also 3rd Party people for easy kills is just stupid and hypocritical. 
“PeOpLe ArE bUiLdInG sTuPiDlY hIgH sTrUcTuReS” Yes with GR players were building higher than before since they knew they wouldn’t get knocked down and it gave the game something new and interesting that the game needed since why would anybody want to limit themselves to only 3 stories of high

In my honest opinion thousands of REEEEE about GR were just stupid sheep following the flock and GR should comeback to the game either with some improvements or not.

It seems like they’re doing everything to nerf building in every patch with the changes they make, and the weapons they add. It’s like they want to discourage people from building now. 

It went from people complaining about shotguns being OP, especially double pump. That got nerfed. Then they decided to put a delay when swapping between shotguns so pump tac died. Then they added all these smgs. Then nerfed the max hp of builds. Then clingers. Then quad launcher. Then this then that then this then that. It just feels like everything they’re adding into the game just caters to players who don’t build, and they’re punish players who do build. They’re getting further and further away from one of the cores of the game, and that’s building. It’s what made their game so successful in the first place. 

I fell in love with this game from the very first time I played it, but as the seasons come n go I feel like the game is getting worse n worse. I’ve barely played this season compared to others because I don’t find it as fun anymore. I’m annoyed with it more than anything. From the spray and pray meta to now whatever this meta is. It’s just all around bad.

I still play because it’s a way to socialize with my friends, and it’s not all so bad when you’re kicking it with the boys playing a game. But there’s just a lot about the game that turns me off. I went from playing 4-5 hours a night to going a couple days at a time without playing. I used to be able to play this game non stop now it’s like I don’t even care to turn it on. 

I know that epic won’t be able to make everyone happy, and when someone like me complains about a change I’m sure there’s people out there that love it. I guess u either deal with it or stop playing...",FortNiteBR

Water, shoots a water ball, rusts the steel structure weakening it

Earth, can weaken brick structures, or shake the ground underneath the opponent, disrupting their aim.

To provide some context to this situation, I had several family members pass away unexpectedly about 600 miles away from where I live, so I went down to the services and stayed for several weeks after. When I return (roughly three or four weeks ago) I’m greeted with a message saying that my account has been permanently suspended. My initial response was “what the hell?” because I wasn’t even home during the time when I was banned. And before y’all clap my cheeks about “You probably deserved it,” I have been playing since about September 24th (before it was released for free on the 26th) of 2017, and put in about 500 dollars into cosmetics, and have been a devout player for a very long time. So I wouldn’t even dare to partake in any action that would run any risk of punishment, i.e., banning. So with that said, I suspect that my account had been compromised, which happened to me once before so I enabled 2FA, but clearly that didn’t help, and I explain this to Epic in the support tickets. With the passing of my family members, having a lot of my money and spent time just tossed in the drain seems to be adding insult to injury. I’m hoping that this post gains traction not only to obtain my account back, but to draw attention to the lack of support and attention in the Customer Service department. I feel like I’m often talking to a brick wall, always getting the same response of “At Epic Games, we're serious about protecting accounts for our players. In this case, we disabled your account due to suspicious activity, and we cannot reactivate it.” Well, if they cared so much about protecting the accounts, then why the hell am I being swatted away like a fly when there clearly was a breaching of my account. Why is the victim getting punished. Step up your game on player support, Epic Games. It would benefit you very well, trust me.

When in highly irregular landscapes (such as hills, mountains, whatever), not having the ability to redeploy seriously breaks the game when the circles are moving.
With your glider, you could always take the high ground and try to keep it, to not be dependent on the landscape. Or build bridges from hills to hills. Or just glide if needed.
Without gliders, you can do none of the previous cases. A bridge will be shot down. A high ground is ephemeral as once the circle moves you need to go the next high ground position, and without glider/bridge/etc, you're as good as dead (to the storm mainly). You don't have time to build yourself a way down, then up again.

Do you want it back to 3rd party or fly away when they are being beaten in a fight there shouldn't be a easy way out cause you low on health or have zero mats left. 

Fall damage is fine building up and down mountains should be risky or a high build battle its part of the fun.

People are saying its a walking simulator now haha its far from it you can easily land Snobby, Lucky, Junk Wailing etc and get into the first circle there is plenty of options kicking around the map. 

Let's just enjoy the game

Youtube has finally contacted me back, they have asked me to send evidence of the content stole, I have sent a reply already with everything I could remember, I believe it's enough to get action taken, but we'll have to see.

Thank you, everyone, for supporting me.

I'm a relatively casual player that's hoping to improve in this game so that I can stream it and actually have an audience (AKA not suck). I'm relatively good with the gunplay but I'm pretty terrible when it comes to outbuilding an opponent.

So I thought I would ask this community how I should play to improve. I understand I can watch all the YouTube videos and streamers in the world, but I don't think that will fix my mechanics, which I think needs the most work.

So what should I do?

Should I drop Tilted Towers 100 times like that LukeTheNotable guy?

Should I play super aggressively and try to get into as many gunfights as I can?

Or should I sit back a little more and try to outbuild my opponents and take the high ground before I try to engage them?

Example: I just had a solo win completely handed to me by *pure* RNG: landed alone, llama fell on top of me when I broke a tree right after looting first house. Found a golden heavy shotgun in the last chest I searched before the first circle finished closing. Found an unclaimed loot drop. Found a gold scar in a chest right next to said drop. Found a vending machine selling a purple heavy sniper for wood; I'm down to 450 wood and 700+ brick and 300+ metal after buying it. Found *another* unclaimed loot drop. Still have yet to see or hear another player. Build a ramp to get into the circle, realize I have a good vantage point and stay up for a minute or two, then opt to just keep building up to skybridge into the later circles. Circles closing over Loot Lake (no high ground where people are likely to spot sky bridges accidentally). Easy snipe #1. Easy snipe #2 - land a bodyshot for 150, they spot my platform and start to shoot me down but I finish them just before they destroy my platform. Still unnoticed. Circle starts backtracking over my sky bridge, sparing me having to build anything else. Turn to run back along my sky bridge, see a loot drop *on my fucking sky bridge* that had been in the storm but was uncovered. 1v1, me with 200HP, two slurps, six minis, still ~500 resources, a gold scar, and a gold heavy shotgun I didn't touch, and still unnoticed in the sky.

Fortnite, fundamentally as a shooter is complete trash. Coming from skillful games such as Gears, Halo hell even call of duty back in the days. There where no holding hands. The devs didn’t implement things to give the casual a fighting chance against someone who is leagues above them. I remember when games had true skill ceilings. Fortnite used too as well. There is nothing skillful when it comes to playing Fortnite. It is an RNG/Bloom based game. Try telling that to any other person whose been playing FPS shooters or shooters in general all of there life. This game allows the shittiest and worst players to compete against top 1% players. Spend a good solid hour or 2 just building and you’ll have the building down. In today’s game, that’s all you need. You don’t need a good aim/shoot to win in this shooter. All you need is mats and spamming your build key/button, keep conscience of the circle and only move when you have to (when the storm makes you.) Every single game I played it came down to either the last circle or the circles that proceed to move throughout the map as the game comes to an end. Then it boils down to whoever gets the most RNG damage out of a pump or whoever gets the best bloom spread out of your SMG. Fortnite has gone in the wrong direction ever since season became a thing. But hey, that don’t matter when your playerbase is the average age of 14 and only cares about if sally, Tina and Timmy will be on later so they can grind squads and literally sweat there ass off, only to pass it off as you’re trash, we aren’t even trying and get good. Fortnite is a child’s game, if you tell me you’re good at Fortnite I almost die laughing. This is nothing more then a child’s game.

However, with the addition of powerful close range SMG's, shotguns l, at their current state, are becoming more obsolete. My idea to balance them compared to other close range weapons, would be to give all the shotguns a base damage. My suggestion:

SET MINIMUM BASE DAMAGE: (rarity left to right)
- TACTICAL (30,35,40)
- PUMP (50,60)
- HEAVY (70, 80)
- DOUBLE BARREL (40,50)

- Six Shooter: Literally don't know why we have this
- Minigun: The mounted turret should take its place

Fortnite is NOT dying.,"**Conclusion:** The game is not dying, and it’s not because of redeploy. We’ve seen polls showing that the community is split 50/50 on redeploy, which basically says that having a gamemode with and without redeploy is epic’s best bet.

Why do people post to Reddit? It’s because they’re either really proud of something they want to share, or they just lost to someone using a balanced feature and they’re tilted so they rant to reddit about how they’re not having fun so the game must be dying. This sub is basically all the negative opinions, so I’ll try to make a positive argument.

I love the redeploy myself. Being able to build freely is so much less stressful and being able to get out of bad situations is useful. People say redeploy is bad for two things: a) third partying, and b) people disengaging too much. Maybe try adjusting how you play to prevent this? You need to be off the ground to redeploy, so maybe don’t have a build battle to sky limit? (and if they do run from, you can still shoot them, you don’t have to chase them immediately). Third partying was always an issue, and it will be in every team game, so maybe counter it and shoot at the third party for a bit so they have to heal. Or end the fight sooner so you don’t have two opponents at once.

I know it’s easy to say this, but I see nobody at all arguing this way because the bandwagon gives more karma. Maybe redeploy makes you win less, but it’s fun, and if you’re not having fun with it, are you really winning?",FortNiteBR

1. Before glider re-deploy the time between fights was too inconsistent. People are complaining about being third partied too much, you can’t honestly tell me you weren’t getting third partied before the update?

2. Launch pads are still good. A quick way to get height on the opposition. Are you just gonna glider re-deploy up a mountain/hill? No. You will double ramp rush place launch and push on the hill with less trouble than ramp flooring above you. 

3. Overall easier for new players to adapt to the game. It’s more of a RNG type game while also still being tactical. This makes it good for players coming from COD, CSGO and all sorts of other games.

I don’t even care if traps go back to 100 health it’s still ridiculously OP. They’d just place 2-3 of them. They either need to do like 50 damage with a 5-10 second cool down of replacing, or a 5-10 building period. Either way would take away instant kills with traps.",FortNiteBR

It brings back fall damage into build fights, which will make people build less recklessly.
It will reduce third partying as people wouldn't be able to instantly build and rush into fights.
It will reduce people just gliding away from fights.
It will make people think a little more before instantly rushing someone once they deal some dmg as it will slow down rush times and enable people time to heal etc.

Fix it or remove redeploy until this bug is fixed.

Secondly, audio bugs. Rocket Launchers will play a quarter of the sound and then it just fades out, you dont know where the rockets are even coming from, or where theyre being shot from...this has been around for so long &amp; it still hasnt been fixed. 

Lastly, due to everyone building random ramps everywhere to glide, the frames are literally awful, everywhere you look there is random builds and random FPS drops because of it. Again, dont mind redeploy after it being in the game this long, but the landing animation NEEDS to be addressed &amp; the FPS due to ramps being placed everywhere NEEDS to be addressed. These 2 things are why I want redeploy out of the game IF there was any reason to remove it. The pacing is cool, the speed of the game is cool, the 3rd partying is cool, but the fucked animations, the audio bugs, and the FPS just needs to be fixed. Period. This game used to be so good, literally so good. Now its just a decent game &amp; updates dont make it better, they keep it the same or they make it worse...that is not what updates are meant for.

Set it up so that he person physically has to jump to deploy the glider. This will solve the problem of shooting peoples structures down and you will still get those kills. As they will be unable to get down before it crumbles ideally. While if they preemptively bug out of a build battle it is still an option. Sorry for the formatting posted on mobile.,FortNiteBR

or maybe if a squad is wiped, spawn a giant mushroom that we can pick axe for shield.

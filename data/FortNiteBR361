If my squad wins, they'll pick me back up and we can keep playing, and if we lose, then we all get sent back to the lobby and start a new match, right? Unfortunately it almost never works like that. More and more often, unskilled or just outright disrespectful players will full kill you instantly in the middle of a squad fight just to see that kill counter go up by one, no matter the cost. This is incredibly frustrating to me and many others since if it happens to you and your squad ends up winning the fight, you are stuck spectating for the rest of the game.

My solution to this problem would be to give more health to downed players, but increase the damage per tick that they take while down. For example, if a downed player has 500 health and loses 10 per tick, they would still have the same amount of time to be revived without bleeding out as with the current system. This would help a downed player to tank some shots and prevent the panic response from many players where once they know that they can't win they just try to take someone with them. This would also make full killing someone when you can't find the rest of their squad a much more tactical choice (do you waste all of your ammo on someone who already isn't fighting back or do you risk having them alive to give away your position?)

EDIT:  I changed my mind. I didn't realize how many people liked the current system the way it is, I just assumed that being full killed in squads was something that happened to and annoyed everyone. Seems like I'll just have to adapt my play style to it.",FortNiteBR

Here is how I learnt to build in two games.,"When I first started Fortnite on console I used the Standard Button Layout which was you had to press Triangle (PS4) to change you weapons and your build types. 
I then switched to Combat Pro and I learnt it really quick. I tried it once before and I hated it but then I think it was last month I tried again after having a break from Fortnite (broken PS4) I came back and loved combat pro.

Anyway this week I have Switched to Builder Pro Layout. It is so much Easier and Quicker to Build. It also does not take long to learn either. Especially if you came from Standard to Combat. (btw i'm explaining in PS4 controller terms, You do the maths.)

Basically the weapon changes are the exact same so you press L1 and R1 to Switch to Each Weapon. However when you press Build Mode you will get a Slot for Each Build Type ,
The Keys are
L1 is Roof/Triangle,
R1 is Flat/Floor,
L2 is Stairs,
R2 is Wall,
Square is Traps/Launch Pads etc,
Left on the D-Pad is to Change Materials.

Please Note if you have Turbo Mode on (Which is best for this Mode) If you hold it too long it will put that wall out) But that is what is great about it. You can build a quick 4 walls and stairs so much quicker because you just open the build mode. Your fingers already or L2 and R2 and Turbo mode is Great for rushing people. You can build stronger Ramps Quicker.
The only thing I suggest is to go to either Wailing or Moisty for the first few games and practice different building techniques. You just got to remember the first few times you come to a gun fight you kind of panic and you probably will mess up. Unless your really good of course.

Dont give up it took me 2 games and I came 2nd in that  2nd game. Building is Insane So much easier to get the higher ground and making stronger bases so they are less easier to knock down.

I acknowledge that the skill cap for a game like this with m+kb is higher, but the option exists to go and compete on an even keel for those that want that (play on PC).

Why are those that choose to play with a controller (PS4 at least I have no idea about Xbox) not given the same opportunity?

So tbh my life is pretty fucked. I have depression, anxiety, adhd and I find my life hard. I have been depressed for two or three years now and I’ve also been on medication for a bit but idek if it’s helping. I go to doctors and shit to make me feel better but something I can always depend on is fortnite. I had attempted suicide a few months ago (so age 15) but I guess I’m a bit better. The reason I say fortnite has saved my life is because school is tough for me mentally. I’m still on track to graduate and I’m still getting A’s but I hate it with a passion and it makes everything worse but I can also think of it as when I get home I can play fortnite and relax and if I’m ever feeling suicidal I can go play some fortnite or even just thinking about the next time I can play will make me feel better. I just wanna say thank you to this wonderful game as it has done wonders for me and I will forever love it. And I hate to ask for upvotes but it would be appreciated because if an epic employee saw this it would be great for them to know they are making people better and happier:) I was quite uncomfortable writing all of this.

As many of you know, real shotguns work by firing out a bunch of small pellets. Following the real life version, video game designers, including Epic, have decided to program shotguns the same way. When you fire a shotgun in fortnite, ten pellets are fired in random directions within the spread, and the damage is calculated by (number of pellets that connect) x (damage per pellet), with the damage decreasing with range. This sounds logical, but it unfortunately leads to the inconsistency we have with the current shotguns. Even if you have your crosshairs almost completely on your enemy, you may get unlucky and only get one hit. This is what leads to the annoying 9 damage pump shots.

My solution is to calculate the damage based on percentage of the reticle covered by the enemy player. For example, if you’re super close up and you have the shotgun shoved in their face, the entire crosshair area is covered, and it would deal 100% damage. If you have horrible aim like me and the enemy player is on the edge of your reticle covering only 1/3 of it, the shotgun will deal 33% of it’s max damage. You could add qualifiers to this as well, for example at least 10% of the area has to be covered for it to deal damage. This would solve the issue of being able to hit someone at long distance with a shotgun, even if it only would be like 1% damage.

Let me know what you guys think, and if you agree plz upvote

Yes, there are a lot of white dudes, but this is an American game, and America is more than 50% white (but not for long!). But still, we have black characters, we have Asian and Latino characters, and we have white characters. Pretty good.

I'm a Jewish gamer, and I have a rather Persian look. I would love a skin that represents my heritage, especially with so much antisemitism in the world. It's hard for me to play in random squads because people use the word ""Jew"" as a verb so often, and although I try not to let it bother me, I admit it does.

Raptor's splash screen shows what he looks like under his skull mask, and his look is similar to mine. Raptor could be a Jew. But since I don't have the option to take off his mask, it doesn't matter what his ethnicity is.

So Epic, could you please continue your trend of diversity which is so  beautiful and healthy-minded by including more racial types, such as people of Persian and Arabic descent and also Indian decent? I'm sure there are many other ethnicities that could be represented as well.

And finally, on the subject of diversity, what about body diversity? I personally am thin but wonder if gamers of other body types feel alienated by all the skins having less than 10% body fat and ridiculous pro-athlete-level physique (which I don't have)? It's fun to play as super humans, but I'd also like to play as an Average Joe or Jane who happens to kick ass at murdering people with a pump.

And what about age diversity? Here's my personal dream skin: an old, fat, balding Jewish Rabbi, complete with all necessary accoutrements. That would just be so kickass.",FortNiteBR

I am from Asia and English isn't my first language. I also have a speaking problem where sometimes I speak too fast or mumble in my words. Problem with playing on Asian servers is that this continent has tons of languages and I'll probably be paired with people who neither speak my language or English.

I play on NAE Servers and I've had no problem before this. Suddenly, since the last week, I'm being paired with people who immediately make fun of my name and my accent.

That being said, they should not be allowed to play on NA servers. Anyone who has played Day Z, H1Z1, Planetside 2, or PUBG, is aware of why Fortnite should be region locked. To provide the most optimal gaming experience for all players. 

PUBG/PC Gamer released an article recently stating that over 99% of the cheaters caught/banned and even still playing, reside in China. Fortnite has yet to be released in China, but supposedly it is happening later this year. Being a PC gamer my entire life, latency (ping) is very important. Playing on anything over 100, as many of you know, leads to many annoying things. Not sure why so many games have refused to region lock Asian players, mostly Chinese. Probably because of the relationship they have with the Chinese community, or because one of many Chinese gaming conglomerates have stake in the developing company. Tencent owns 40% of Epic Games. Tencent was also responsible for the publishing of PUBG in China recently. 

Back to the ping, who wants to play on 300-800+ ping, which is what they get when playing on NA servers. It should raise a red flag to the developers. Knowing fully that cheating is a culture in these countries, region lock should always be implemented, but never has been except for Planetside 2. If you played PS2 or H1Z1, the Chinese player base literally ruined the game for NA players. It did as well for PUBG, seeing as Bluehole banned millions of players, all from China. PUBG was a $30 game. Imagine once Fortnite hits China, and it's free-to-play. 

I already experience Asian players late night. I play mostly after midnight EST. They skip around, throw off hit registry, and some of them do aimbot (which is rare now).  

To make it fair for every person playing, on NA, Europe, South America, etc. Region lock needs to be implemented. This topic is already gaining ground on a lot of e-news outlets, and has a lot of people worried, including myself. I enjoy Fortnite. I do not want my gaming experience to turn into H1Z1 2.0 or PUBG 2.0. I'm sure none of you do either. 

This is a topic that truly needs to be addressed, EPIC needs to acknowledge that the Chinese player base has a potential negative outcome. If we wait until it's a problem, which it will be, it just ruins this community, like it has done in the past. 

TLDR: They skip around because of lag, nobody wants to deal with that. Also, a large number of them cheat, and find it amusing to troll NA players. If you played any previous Battle Royale game, you know this. 

Edit: Take a few minutes and Google the numbers behind H1Z1/PUBG bans, 99%+ from China (millions of Chinese banned), and how the Chinese players made up 50%+ of the player base.

They are forced into a game where they don't know any mechanics or controls, or who their allies are. Also, I'm talking about *super* noobs, like people using fortnite as their very first FPS game, and haven't ever watched any twitch streams or replays.

I'll get right to the point, make a tutorial preferably on a small map like spawn island with tires, buildings, weapons on the ground, moving or static targets that tells you the layout of of your screen, what all the sounds mean, all the controls. 

Mainly on ""all the countrols"" heck I have friends who are good at this game and don't know what push to talk or how to use emotes.

I'm mostly saying this from experience, here's some dumb things I did my first few games that even I myself laugh at:

-opened my glider right out of the bus and landing off the main island think I could swim

-avoiding ALL water (loot lake, moisty) after dying in the previous game 

-shooting a chest thinking that how they opened

-using pickaxes on chest thinking that was how they worked

-holding ""e"" for a solid minute on a garbage bag after figuring out that's how chests opened thinking I could loot a trash bag.

-shooting doors thinking that's what made them open

-jumped off a cliff not knowing there was ""fall"" damage

-shooting my teammates (I didn't know they were teammates)

-using a grenade as a impulse grenade thinking all explosive weapons had some kinetic force to them

-using an impulse grenade by throwing them in front of me

-trying to talk to teammates without pushing the push to talk button

-using the scroll wheel to try and switch building materials

-trying to build in mid air

-Attacking a bush thinking it would become the consumable

A lot of these aren't really any true ""experience""or ""skill"" so to speak, I feel like a tutorial that introduces what a battle royale is and its controls/rules would be healthy for newer players.

1) Increase range that you can throw it, not sure what the distance would be but maybe +25% increase, that way you could get a kind of COD feel when lofting in a C4 To detonate it.

2) Some sort of an alarm system so you don’t have to camp by it all the time to use it. I don’t want to make it to OverPowered and I feel like this may make it really good, but maybe not. Need some advice on this one

I have come across some problems that I don't know how to solve.,"Hello guys/girls, I need help. Seriously. I just got into Fornite and I can see the potential of the game. Before I even start playing the game, I watch Ninja's twitch stream, and other Fornite streamers. To get a taste of what I'm getting into. 

Anyways, what I'm trying to get at—is that I FREAKING SUCK. lol. After 3 days of playing, my kill count is literally...5. I am never that much of a PVP type of player, but just 5 kills in the total of 3 days is embarrassing. I know kills is not the thing to focus on in Fornite. But I'll get to that...

I know what I need to improve. 
1. Building
2. My poor reflexes 

Ok, so I know kills is not something a new player is suppose to depend on. But even by luck I manage to be one of the last two standing, I then encounter my problem. One grueling problem that I seem to come across in every game is the 1v1. I don't know how to win a 1v1. I'm serious. 

For example, I looted a chest and got a common Assault Rifle. I heard a guy coming up the stairs. I position myself. I crouch. I also move around. I see him, I shoot. But he had a shotgun, and my continuous rapid fire was not fazing him at all (I had no shield). Another example: I have a shotgun. I jump around while shooting. End result, I got wreck by a guy who two-shoted me. I had half shield and full health. WHAT THE HELL? AM I SUPPOSE TO AIM FOR THE HEAD ONLY? Is me doing the body shots the problem here?

 I don't know what I'm doing wrong. What am I doing wrong :(

Well I figured, what the hell, I'll see if any of this shit is true and if I find an epic SMG, I'll pick it up and use it over a shotty to see if I can be converted.  Well fuck you, you all are wrong, quit defending SMG's, they are absolute unbalanced trash.  Case in point:

First game,no one had a mic and they all went tilted.

Second game,one guy had a mic and dropped tilted while everyone else went Salty.

Third game,I met this kid. He had to be less then like 7 years old and he was playing with his dad watching and helping him. I talked to him a bunch that game and he was just adorable,and he actually had knowledge of the game constantly telling me to get mats or where an enemy was.

We made it to the top ten and the last 2 squads taught each other so it was now a 2v4(our tm8s died early) he told me to build a base and we did. He told me where an enemy was and I sniped and he cheered me on. He told me to rush them while he miniguns from the back. I do as told and we absolutely whooped the last squad and boy oh boy was the kid so happy. Right when the Victory Royale popped up he screamed to the top of his lung and started celebrating with his dad and told me to add him.


We played a few more games before I had to go but man it felt good. He was so kind and wasn’t even a bad player. And the best part is when I told him a had to go he said

“Bye Best Friend”

Damn FortNite made me shed a tear today.

&gt; 1. Have a backup of the game folder ""Fortnite"". (The one including ""Engine"" and ""ForniteGame"".)
&gt; 2. Move a copy of the ""Fortnite"" folder to the desired location.
&gt; 3. Rename the ""Fortnite"" folder in the new location to ""Fortnite123"".
&gt; 4. Open up the launcher and click the cog next to launch and hit ""remove"", confirm and uninstall Fortnite.
&gt; 5. Click Install and choose the new location (in this example choose ""C:\Games\Epic Games"" so the install directory would be ""C:\Games\Epic Games\Fortnite"").
&gt; 6. Start the installation and cancel it shortly later, confirm the cancellation and close the launcher.
&gt; 7. In the new location, delete the folder ""Fortnite"" that was created from the short installation.
&gt; 8. Rename the game folder ""Fortnite123"" to just ""Fortnite"".
&gt; 9. Start the launcher and hit continue, you then should be able to launch Fortnite from it's new location.

Sometimes I destroy accidentally a chest when I built some stairs and I destroy the roof because I didn't knew that the chest is exactly over my position. 

Do you think this error will someday be fixed? Other kind of loot is staying in the air without a problem but the chest disappear. ",FortNiteBR

If you are new, land somewhere unnamed. This way you get into fewer fights, and you will almost always make it into the final 10. However, if you are going fo a high kill game, or just want a more exciting experience, land somewhere named, for example, Retail Row or even Tilted Towers. When you land, you will want to find a shotgun. Most early game engagements are close ranged, therefore you will want a shotgun. Once you have a shotgun, try to find other guns. Early game, I suggest running three guns and two meds, because you will run into more players and will likely need health more often. I always have a set order that my guns are in during my games. I suggest doing this so that you train your muscle memory to always know where the gun you want is. 

II. **Mid Game**

This is when you could consider taking four guns and one med because you will encounter fewer players. **DO NOT BUSH CAMP.** Everyone hates bush campers, and you will never get better by hiding in a bush. You should make sure you have a good amount of resources, so that you have enough to build a fight. During this part of the game, try to never engage in a fight in which you do not have the advantage. All of your fights should be ones that you can win. However, if someone shoots at you first, make sure to build and shoot back. In general, you should try to gain upper ground, and make sure you are aware of the storm.

III. **Final 10**

This is when you have no choice but to engage. When you see someone, shoot as soon as possible. Try to make sure you have the upper ground in fights, and again, fight smart. Build as much as you can and make sure you shoot first. However, if you get shot at first, build as much as you can, and try to ramp rush them. Many people back down when they are rushed, and this is when you jump at them with a shotgun. if you are ramp rushed, **do not back down.** You need to build up to them, and get as many shots off as you can, and sometimes you can even drop back down and shoot down their structure. In general, during this time, you will always have to engage, and **you will need to play aggressive if you want to win fights.**

IV. **Final 5**

This is very similar to final 10, except if you can, you should back away from fights. The circle will be so small that as soon as you finish one fight, you will be in another one. Let the other players fight it out. If you can, pick off a player that has just finished fighting. **Never put yourself in a fight where there is ANY chance of you losing.** Play slowly until final 2.

V. **Final 2**

This is the final fight of the game. **GET THE HIGH GROUND AND DO NOT LOSE IT.** The high ground is very important in this fight. if you can, try not to get in a shotgun fight. Shoot them at range, and whittle their health down until they are dead. Do not let them heal up, just keep shooting until they are dead. As long as you have the high ground, you will win this fight 99 times out of 100. Congrats, you just got a Victory Royale!

Way faster . If they switch up the way pieces are prioritized when buttons are held in.

If I hold down the stairs button I get stairs. 

If while holding down the stairs button I want a wall, I press wall and get a wall. But when I release the wall button it switches back to the stairs because I had the button held in .(and continues to build)

So if I want to rush someone with wall stairs wall. Technically I just hold in the stairs button while pressing and releasing the wall button at the appropriate timing. 

This could be of  benefit to both turbo and non turbo mode. Reducing your presses by 1 in each instance . Even if you don't understand up vote so the devs can see this.

Weapon Skins / Bullet Trail Skins: I don't know if I'm the only one who would purchase weapon skins or bullet trail skins that would be applied to whatever weapon you pick up. Could be bought by individual weapons, weapon class, or packs.

Also assuming you were a casual player you would probably get to level 60 before the season ends. As you probably know you get 2 battle stars when you level up from 1-4 and 6-9. You get 5 battle stars every time you go up to the 5 level and 10 battle stars every time you hit a multiple of 10. So if you got to level 60 you would be at 184 battle stars from leveling up or 18 tiers. So all together you would end at tier 73, which accumulates to 1100 vbucks.

And the reason why is that Quake is consistent and predictable, and it lets players unleash their skill.

Now that doesn't mean that Fortnite needs to be Quake, that's not what Fortnite is for, but EPIC games can learn from Quake to increase not only core, hardcore and competitive player satisfaction, but also casual players as well.

#Shotguns

No one. No matter How hardcore or casual, likes to see a well placed shot do next to nothing.

No player is happy about an inconsistent system that robs them of what they feel they accomplished.

Casual players are less likely to be affected but there are, at times, where players who are maybe just 2 or 3 hours a week, will come into situations where they try their best, and yet their best is robbed from them, simply by the fact that consistency is not rewarded well in this game.

I'm ofc talking mostly about Shotguns here. Shotguns are without a doubt, the Quintessential close ranged engagement weapon for Fortnite. Close Range combat is heavily reliant on the shotguns in this game. And yet these shotguns are also radically inconsistent.

I have seen clips of players get pointblank headshots and those not register as headshots, and I've seen players headshot people from AR distance with shotguns and watch those shots hit incredible amounts of damage. I have personally hit shots that after I see my enemy die, I think ""THAT'S BULLSHIT, THERE IS NO WAY THAT SHOULD HAVE KILLED THEM.""

So needless to say, Shotguns are without a doubt, needlessly and utterly in consistent.

So then, what can Fortnite learn from Quake? Quake(3Arena/Live/Champions) use shotguns that have dedicated and reliable spread patterns. A set of rings that define spreadshot pellets.

Here's 2 screenshots from QC showing what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/V9nP3

All of these pellet spread are from the Supershotgun(think Pump Shotgun), see how they form rotation yet consistent pellet rings?

This makes shotguns consistent, pellet spread predictable, and it allows fall off damage to be registered properly as well. 

This is something that Fortnite needs to adopt to make shotguns able to be balanced, and able to consistently stand up to their role for close range engagement. 

In this case, aim while important, is not the primary factor for shotgun usage, instead it becomes Close Range, and movement that favors the shotgun.

This helps casual players get a grip on shotgun behavior without removing the skill factors behind ""hopping shotgun"" strategy. It rewards rushing, and weapon choices at the right time, and punishes them for having the wrong weapon for the engagement.

In the hands of any player, Consistency feels good.

#Weapon Swaps

Everyone is concerned about Double Pump and ridiculous Burst damage from Weapon rotation. No one, except maybe myth and daequan.(sorry for the call out boys, no harm meant!) wants to see a Double Pump return where people drop 600DPS because the game has no resriction or barrier on multi weapon wielding.

So what can Quake teach us here?

Well first off, The way weapon delay is right now, its very frustrating. It feels clunky and irritating to pull out a gun and watch it come out sloppy slow, and you click to fire only to be met with no rounds being fired.

This sucks. It's sloppy and weird.

So what can Quake teach us here?

Quake has a great solution to this, and it does what people want for Fortnite, without the clunk.

In quake(EG Champions/Live/Arena) Weapons cannot be swapped out until they are able to be fired again.

For example, the Railgun takes 1600ms to Reload, which means you can fire the weapon immediately as it is pulled out, but it does not let you swap away from it. So you must make the shot, or chose a better weapon for the up coming situation. If you take the shot, you are reloading for 1600ms and then you will be able to either fire again, or swap out to a more approriate weapon.

This is the ideal balance solution for Shotguns in Fortnite. This means no matter how many pumps and tact shotguns are being held by a player, they cannot rely on it to deal out immense amounts of unregulated burst damage.

This means no more double pumping, because the only pump you need is the one you're firing.

And in terms of balance. With ""weapons swap on reloaded"" design, each and every weapons rate of fire can be adjusted for balance individually without making any delays to any other part of the game.

Each weapon now has it's own set of regulations that can be fine tuned and adjusted.

This is why Quake's combat feels so fluid and skill based, When you fire a weapon you are making a choice of engagement. If you take that Railgun shot, and you miss, you are punished for that miss. but if you instead chose to close the gap and pull out the HMG or LG and make it a closer range engagement you take a risk but can be rewarded with proper choices.

Weapon Swap on Reloaded is what this game can take from Quake in a means to introduce fluid and balanced gameplay and eliminate problems with player mechanic abuse. 

Pump TactTact for example is a valid engagement choice still, it rewards the payers good enough to pull off that first shot, and able to follow up with a higher rate of fire weapon.

This solution includes people trying to 4 deagle, or doublebolt, and other weapons as well.

This is a fine tuning choice that can be made to make the game less clunky and far more ready for balance.

Epic can learn a lot from Quake and make Fortnite better for not just competitive players, but also casual players.

The game doesn't need to be quake, nor should it follow in quake's foot steps, but there are great solutions to learn from many different kinds of games that improve your own.",FortNiteBR

I slowly picked the game up and had hundreds of games, but only 12 solo wins. I felt like I'd hit some sort of skill roof and decided to move over to the PC version.

I used to be a high level CS player and have always had a good aim, but fortnite is different... I'm currently sat at 220 games in solo, 490 kills, but only 8 wins... I've gone days now without one.

I feel like I can't get better at fortnite. It frustrates me because I get bored quickly when I'm not getting in the top 10 (45 top 10's). When someone rushes me, I just panic... I know how to build but I can't think on what to do. I get a shot on them and miss. My aim is horrible... my hand just cramps up and I miss the easiest of shots.

Whats wrong? I see these people with 400+ wins and think... how the hell? I spend hours and hours on the PC each day trying to get better but I just cant. Fortnite is the first game I've encountered where I just can't seem to become a consistently good player at.

Fortnite was at its peak when it first came out or around Christmas time but with the addition of skins and the new areas in the map, the game has went downhill. It feels so nostalgic now looking back at old fortnite and it was more fun. Fortnite at its current stage is an awkward game which causes too much stress and is far too competitive. Even the sounds and music in the old fortnite was a lot better, I remember the sound of the bus starting and then my first time ever dropping, when you would pick a gun up it would make a better noise. I definitely think the old music should be added back and the old sound affects should be as well. Plus, the design of the guns were better in my opinion, it just felt so fresh. I understand that many people like the new version but epic should add a game mode which is exactly like the game when it first came out, with the same graphics perhaps. Let’s face it, the fortnite community is extremely toxic and it is the new rick and morty, it was a lot better before it became popular and speaking of toxic (warning fanboys) I believe that ninja takes control of everything and has pretty much killed the game because he wants to have his way and with the removal of the double pump, ninja has been presented like a toxic gamer.

Its happened all throughout Fortnite over its existence, but until now have I just dealt with it by not caring and internally screaming. (Probably causing myself to have a tumor) Had 4 games this night ruined with my friend by a rocket ending. 4 strong duo games with 12 kills, 13, 15 and 21. All of them 2nd places because 1 of 2 things occurs; either the team with the rpgs waits till we fight the 3rd place team then flanks us, or waits until we are DONE fighting the 3rd place team and are trying to heal. Then they just barrage us with a non-stop LTM High explosives-styled amount of rockets that you simply cant outbuild. We both have 50 HP and basically have no way to win the fight unless we get a lucky 200 pump shot, but simply cant even get close to these guys as they just endlessly let loose rockets or nades that destroy all your hopes and dreams. 4 games of Adrenaline filled, heart racing, action packed build battles, who can one pump the next guy fights, and sniper shootouts. Just to end with two cucklords with 1 kill each spraying you Junkrat style with one hand while drinking a cup of tea in the other cause its such an easy win for them. 

I know it sounds like Im whining, but I really want to create a fair argument on this subject with explosive type weapons. My idea of these weapons and I feel Epics idea for them, was that they were created to destroy buildings, just like the minigun. But I feel they are 30% used for buildings, 70% used to just kill people for free. The guided missile was hell on Fortnite. Last duo both had one? Why even try to win. Better to just go afk and go make a sandwhich. Everyone is clearly happy and relieved that its taken out temporarily due to its issue. And are all praying that Epic hears them and just removes it completely. I have the same wish for all explosive weapons, but not to remove them entirely, more or less give them adjustments. A few I thought about are simply:

1. Just lower the drop chance substantially. Make it that you only see an RPG once every like 5-6 games.

2. Completely remove rocket ammo from the game. Gone. But keep the explosive weapons and give them charges. Lets say the RPG gets 10 charges. Once you use all 10, its pretty much exhausted and useless. You then just drop it. If you use 3, but then die, the next guy picks it up and can either decide if having 7 is worth keeping it or not. It still gives the weapon some valid use, it can still take down buildings, but cant be spammed for over 50 times just to be safe in their tiny tower in the distance and get a free win. 

3. Lastly, maybe add another item to the game (even though we bloody already have enough useless things, I'm looking at you silenced white mp5 that shouldnt even be in a chest.) that works like a flak jacket. Give it an epic and legendary rating. But it reduces explosive damage by like 50% epic and 75% legendary and has like 2-3 uses on each then breaks off.

Theres a lot of things in this game that I feel need fixing or tweaking. The game is obviously still in early access and needs time so we can give it that. Its been great so far as it clearly has grown into a worldwide phenomenon. I could sit here and nag about so many pet peeves. But I feel rockets at the end of the game, or just used in general to get free kills anger me in a (REEEEEEEEEEE) way a little too much.

tl;dr Do something about bloody explosive weapons, most notably rpgs at the end of the game causing a free win.",FortNiteBR

if the circle end up within two mountain and there is a team on each mountain ... the game is literally decided by 
Circle RNG ..  

If you don't have the circle you're dead.. over.. back to the lobby .. 

them being so crucial to the game yet so rare is absolutely frustrating ... Also that would make supply drops more contested .. right now in scrims no one take them , because there is literally no reason to risk loosing the game to get nades, golden minigun, trap and bandages


No matter how good you are , no matter if your positioning and decision making was perfect.. without a launchpad in that situation it's over


Alternate Idea to fix this issue: **Don't put the final zone on the left side of the map**


Positioning and decision making should be really important , but this is an unavoidable Issue without launchpads

I recently switched over to builder pro in an attempt to up my building skills in any way possible. After a few days of using it there is one suggestion I would make that wouldn’t change much but still allow the “two clicks” for any piece. This would come at a cost though. I think that the pyramid should be taken out of the game because it is basically useless idk what situation I would rather have a pyramid than a wall or floor. Then the controls would be walls on r1, ramps on l1, and floors on l2 leaving r2 to be our “place structure”. I for one do not like double tapping the piece in order to place it and end up placing unwanted ramps and walls more than I would like. This change would allow for more comfortability to the combat pro users while also getting the speed of the pieces being bound to different buttons. Even if the pyramid piece was not removed but maybe just give us an option to rebind it to a less used key if we want. That’s just my thoughts on the layout. I feel like a change like this would give me the comfort I feel that I lack with builder pro as of right now.

My name is Daniel. I'm a aspiring filmmaker and always want to try new things. Ever since I started playing Fortnite I've had an image of a short film (20-60 minutes in length), and now with the new Replay feature it's possible. Any camera angle I want, and the power to do much more.

So before you go leave a comment saying how stupid this is, hear me out. As a passion project, I believe if we do this right, it will be great.

In order to make it great, there must be voice actors. This is where the community comes in. I'm asking you to join the cast of this so-far unnamed film.

You shoot 3-4 shots that most of them miss because of bloom before the person even sees you and they turn around and beam you. This game should not be on RNG, it should be on skill.

To counter removing bloom and making it easy to beam people from across the map, add very high recoil to weapons, and as the tiers of the weapons go up, the less recoil there is, but still plenty of it. Recoil is possible to control and requires skill, unlike bloom which is 100% rng and can make the best player lose to the worst player.

With high recoil, even the best of players can't beam someone completely, you'd have to control the recoil very well to be able to do that.

Damage no numbers. So I go back and use the replay feature to see and what I see makes me so angry. It shows me pull out the pump and just nothing.... no shot... just me switching to my tac expecting him to have no health i was recording and I went back and looked at shadow play and it shows me firing the shot but doing 0 damage hit marker and all,but in the game replay it shows me not even shooting. Epic really wants this game to fail considering these changes they make. Disappointed ",FortNiteBR

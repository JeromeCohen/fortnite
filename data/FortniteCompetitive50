Is this a sign of addiction??,"It's kind of hard for me to explain but when I first started playing Fortnite in early February it was all I could think about and what I spent all my free time on. It was essentially all I did and when I wasn't playing, I was on reddit, youtube, or twitch watching something related to Fortnite. As the months passed and metas changed, I still played the same amount but it's almost become an obligation or chore to do so. In a sense, deep down I want to take a day or two off from the game but I feel guilty doing anything else in my free time and this doesn't make any logical sense to me. For example, I had the day off from work yesterday and I was actually mad at myself that I watched a movie in the afternoon rather than playing Fortnite. I have ZERO aspirations to go pro as I'm a 29 year old with a stable career and way too many obligations to quit my job and try and go pro at a video game (No disrespect to those chasing this dream at my age). The reason I mention addiction at the end of the title is that this is almost starting to feel like an addiction to me. I want to stop playing so much but for some reason can't or feel guilty when I do stop for short periods of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as most of the members of this sub are serious Fortnite players who consistently grind the game, I thought this would be a good place to make this post. A couple of other things for clarification: I usually average 3.5 hours a day on weekdays and 6 hours a day on the weekends and I started on console but currently play PC.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I alone in this feeling or can others in this sub relate? Any suggestions on what I should do?

I don't know what causes me to always land last in these places (and I've tried so many different distances and areas and I still land last, and I don't get what part of the gameplay or game design, etc.. affects that) but usually I can't seem to get any weapons sufficient enough to even get a kill. Sometimes I land in a house and there is absolutely no weapons in the building. Then you get rushed by someone who magically has the best weapons or the exact weapon to kill you.   


I don't know what people know about the RNG in this game, but it seems to me that these three places have some of the worst weapon loot in the map. I really need some tips about where I should go.   


Here's a scenario: Last night I landed at Salty, went to the far back house facing North by the blue House, there was no weapon in there so I rotated to the house near Dusty and got shields and some weapons, but had to expose myself in the open just because nothing even spawned in the first building. Not even chests, just shotgun ammo and smg ammo. Eventually i got 5 kills here after being third partied by 4 different people. Then I got 12 elims for 2nd place. So my point being, how is it that I can go through all that, even get 12 elims, and barely lose but i'm constantly having issues just even getting weapons or even a kill early game in these three places? It just doesn't seem worth it. My last three wins i got 20 elims and 11 elims twice, but I didn't land at these places.    


I have 3,000+ games played but on 36 wins in solos. I have 5,000 elims; my K/D is 1.7 and I feel like im just doing something really wrong early game because this seems to be the main issue for me. I watch so many streams and videos of people doing building techniques and stuff and I can usually pull them off (except for trapping people, I don't even understand how it works to be honest), but the early game + RNG and third partying is really making me feel unenthusiastic about even trying anymore.   


I know this might sound like a little sporadic rant or something, but it's not; I'm just trying to understand the game better and get better overall, but I feel like im missing something that I don't get. Also I feel pressured to go these three places because of demand of people and judgment of skill and all that, I know perhaps it's better to not go to these places but going anywhere else gets really tedious.

15,Yea_No_Ur_Def_Right,1538678113,9lel0h,13,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9lel0h/algorithm_for_ranked_mode/,1,Algorithm for Ranked Mode,"I am going to assume this is a difficult thing to calculate with a game like Fortnite where placing high and racking up kills can be mutually exclusive.  But most of us can agree we'd like a system that rewards a healthy balance.  So what would be the best way to calculate rank without leading to people either:  1) playing super passive for low kills/high placement; or 2) dropping tilted, racking up kills, then quitting and re-queuing to do the same again.  Too much emphasis on placement will lead to 1), too much emphasis on kills will lead to 2).

&amp;#x200B;

I have NO idea how difficult this would be to execute, but here is my random idea:  the ranked system would track all the player data for KILLS PER GAME (not K/D) and average placement.   These numbers would constantly be changing as each additional ranked game is played and the stats are updated.  

(Why kills per game and not K/D?  I just think Kills Per Game more accurately reflects your playstyle and level of aggression.  People with high winrates often have inflated K/Ds because they obviously die a lot less.)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, every 10 games your Kills Per Game average and your placement average would be compared to the rest of the field and you would be placed in a group based on this average.  The key would be an algorithm that rewards good performance in BOTH categories and does not allow min/max players to take advantage.  

&amp;#x200B;

They could figure out the average win rate % and compare this to the kills per game %.  For example, lets say the average win % of all Fortnite players is 2%.  That would mean that a Victory Royale should be valued the same as the top 2% of kills per game.  So, if the top 2% of Kills per game comes in at 8, then a Victory Royale and an 8 kill game should carry the same value.  You can distribute the points awarded for each kill and each placement using this as a reference and keep hold of this ratio all the way down the line.

YOU had to go up there and kill them. Therefore if you want kills you shoot at people in the builds you don’t shoot at the builds. 

Bottom point is that now there’s an incentive to go towards a build fight not only towards good people but the ones who can shoot a gun towards a build, it’s that simple to third party now. Thoughts?

I believe the core of the problem of the 'kill incentive' directly conflicts with a BR game. Epic tried out-of-game incentives like money and points. I'm arguing here that Epic could add in-game incentives to spice up the game and stick to the spirit of BR while proving real advantages to aggressive players thus making the viewing experience more exciting. Also would have an added benefit of reducing the number of players in end game circles alleviating some of the technical challenges epic hasn't been able to solve yet.

I.e. when you go into the same corner house in pleasant park there will always be a weapon spawn in the living room and there will always be a utility item in the kitchen. 

Additionally the rarity of spawned items could be determined by how far into the game it is. All chests drop white-green from 0-5 minutes, green-blue from 5-8 minutes, blue-purple from 8-11, purple-gold from 12 minutes on.

If you hear gunshots from third party, go down and wait it out. If they have killed each other do the 4 steps above.

Of course it's sarcasm but this works 90% of the time. If the enemie is right above your turtle scare him with traps and fake double ramp one side and go the other side up.

If you do these crazy build offs you will get third partyed 90% of the time these days.

So I looked for everything online and nothing seem to work, until I came across this program:

https://playclaw.com/

Which seems to be a streaming tool like OBS but simplier.

Anyways, to the point:

1- Download PlayClaw +5 from here (click below where it says get a previous version): https://playclaw.com/download/

2- Download a pack of custom crosshairs from literally anywhere. The extension of the image must be .png.

3- Open PlayClaw, set the program to trial mode (it has no expiration date, but recording will watermark the video, otherwise it won't affect anything else)

4- Go to Plugins -&gt; Image Overlay (check it) -&gt; Plugin Settings -&gt; Set the crosshair.png file directory -&gt; Ok

5- Click on Preview Overlays and open the game and head to a playground match and here is the tricky part:

6- Once in the match, alt-tab to the preview overlays window that you previously opened, if done right there should be a black box with the crosshair floating in there.

7- By alt-tabing to the game and to the preview, you have to find manually the center of the game's screen, if you have your pickaxe equiped, the dot in the middle of its crosshair should be good enough indicator.

8- (Optional) While in a match, head to settings -&gt; Game -&gt; Hud and turn the reticle off.

And that should be it. So far its working fine. Since I just found it, I haven't restarted my pc to see if the changes are saved in PlayClaw, but they should since there's an option to create profiles and to start up with Windows.

Without knowing the last 2 challenges (I won't be around for them), but assuming they will be gameplay challenges, and altering the ATK challenge (to just be the MOST in a circle at the end), imagine if yesterday went like this:

1:30 - Official stream starts.
2:00 - 1st challenge is posted on the stream (and it's Anthem)
2 - 3:30 Official stream rotates across random streamers
3:30 Zeke arrives with a co-caster and goes through some highlights,
4:00 - 2nd challenge starts and is posted.  ATK but changed to MOST vehicles in final circle victory. 
4:20 - Zeke takes a bit of a break after the first attempts are over.  Comes back refreshed.   Since it will go the full 2 hours, good highlight of his actual skills (lighthearted comedy).
6:00 - Building challenge announced (I'd go with A to B).  Commentary by Zeke.
8:00 - Last challenge (hopefully a gameplay one that will be run later today, the 2nd day).

Day 2

Same setup
Open with Cosplay.  Bring Zeke in with 30 minutes to go and look around at the best submissions thus far.
2nd would be gameplay - the no shots fired challenge, but change it most wins in the 2 hour span.  Tiebreaker is whoever does X amount first.
4:20 - Zeke break
3rd would be Eiffel Tower.  I think Zeke would have shined here.
4th would be a final gameplay challenge to cap things off.

I really do think he'd have been good at these two days.  Unfortunately I think he'll again be terrible on Friday.  I also think Epic has been doing a pretty poor job communicating pretty much anything with the community, so running this on the main stream would be a very good thing.  A place to get information by viewers.

We've also all seen the posts about mid-game being slower than ever. In my opinion, these go hand in hand. 


The average skill level is higher than it's ever been. With a higher average skill level, more players are confident in ""hot dropping."" Generally, for the past few seasons, there's been about 3 hot drops per bus. Tilted, a pre-existing major POI on the bus route (Greasy, Pleasant, Retail, etc.), and a newly introduced POI. Last season, the newly introduced POI was Paradise. This season, it's the floating Loot Lake island. I'd estimate 75% of the lobby drops at these 3 locations. I have no real statistics for this of course, but I think it's a fair estimate. With that being said, this leaves ~25 players left as the first circle closes. A few more get picked off on rotation and we're left with 15-20 players left at the close of the first circle. At this point, how many times have you found yourself running in circles searching for players and then W-keying at the first sound of shots that you hear? My guess is that almost every other player left alive is itching to fight and doing this same exact thing. Leading to the inevitable 3rd/4th/5th/6th party engagements. I don't see this as something that's ever going to change, in fact it may get worse. Nobody really wants to sit in a 1x1 by for 10 minutes, regardless of skill level. This is also why I think mobility items are extremely important to the game right now. Not just because they're fun, but because they're necessary. Grapplers may be bad (in some people's opinion) in their ability to negate another player's building, but they're great for disengaging from a 3rd party. This sentiment goes for pretty much any mobility item that allows for quick disengagement. ^^I ^^miss ^^bouncers ^^lol",FortniteCompetitive

I'm not even going to explain in detail what I mean because I know for a fact everyone reading knows this issue. You drop at a POI that isn't Tilted or a brand new spot, get maybe a few kills and decent loot, and walk around for 5 minutes doing fuckall and then when you finally get into a fight 3 other people show up. This is incredibly bad for the game. It makes experienced players get more and more bored with the game and it makes for an incredibly dull experience all around.

I think this is a direct result of the Titled meta. When you have 20ish people a game going Tilted and 20ish people going to whatever the newest spot is, you leave very little for the people who don't want to make a habit of dying from spawn 80% of the time.

(Console),"Nothing is more frustrating to me lately than trying to play Fortnite Battle Royale. During seasons 4 and 5 I had gotten quite good, I could get about 5-10 wins a day if I was playing a good amount. Maybe not Twitch god good but better than average. I took a bit of a break towards the end of Season 5, probably the last 3-4 weeks I only did the challenges on BR and switched to Save the World.

Now that I’m back, I’m getting worked over like I did when I first got the game back in Season 2 all over again. I can barely get a single kill per game it’s so embarrassing. And it just makes no sense to me, I am trying as hard as I can to hit my opponents but I’m just not good enough to ever do it consistently! I watch my own replays and break them down. It doesn’t seem to matter if I have cover/peek advantage: as soon as I make my peek the other player invariably is better at using a joystick to aim at a target than I am and my advantages are trumped. I outbuild people, I take fights with weapon advantage, shield advantage, height advantage... none of this ever seems to help me anymore as everyone I fight is better than I am aiming the weapons which seems to be the only mechanic that decides fights. I kinda hated shooting games for a long time until the last few years, games like this and Overwatch have made them more interesting. But this is making me so upset I’m about to uninstall any game with a gun in it and just swear off them for another 5 years.

Can someone please recommend some ways to improve at this in game? I long for the days when I was able to enjoy Fortnite Battle Royale. Now even logging in is so stressful because I feel like an impostor. I have invested so much money into skins in this game I just want to feel like it’s fun again... :(",FortniteCompetitive

EU servers. Solos. I used replay mode to look at all gamertags. Roughly 5 or 6 per lobby could not be found as they had not linked. I rotated 1 solo on each account to account for time of day. Done between 4pm and midnight. 

Account 1: 796 wins, 33% WR, 4.9KD. Nothing pro worthy but a good public player. 

Account 2: 0 wins. From 0-25 games. 0 kills. Straight suicide at the start of every game.

**Averages over 25 solo games**

Average overall wins: 69
Average solo win %: 0.61%
Average overall win %: 1.33%
Amount of players with 0 solo wins (Not including this account: 7.25PG

------------

**Comments**:
Over 25 games I found no real statistical gap between an account with pub stomp stats and an account with 0 kills. The high level outliers (people above account 1 stats) actually came out more in account 2 lobbies than account 1. 

There was no common theme across games, each seemed to have a random spread of skilled and non skilled players (by stat purposes). One game on the account 2 was a massive outlier with 5 players over 800 solo wins. Only two other games had any player with 800 solo wins.

--------

**conclusion and TL;DR**

Lobbies are getting harder but that's due to the potatos we all know and love getting better. There is no evidence from what I looked at to say there has been any skill based match making changes.

This has caused problems on numerous fronts for me. This is generally how it goes for me:

1. Player turtles while I take high ground, so I lose track of exactly where they are
2. I expend lots of mats maintaining high-ground/meticulously tracking down where they are in the forest of builds beneath
3. Once I find them, they generally have a double layer roof, and are in a box with a ramp inside
4. I employ a variety of shitty attempts to get them out of the box and die either to 3rd party or they retake high ground on me

Ok so I can improve 1. and 2. pretty easily, I just have to track better. But even so, I don't know how to efficiently put pressure on someone in a box. Here are my current strategies:

1. Cover all of my sides so I don't get sniped/ARed from a 3rd party and just start spamming down on their roof by editing a floor underneath me, but honestly this just wastes both our time. They will keep building and building, and by mid-game there is no way you're gonna run them out of mats. This is also just inviting a 3rd party. 
2. Drop down on top of their box and try to hit out the pyramid, they spam turbo-build. Sometimes I can get my own pyramid down and edit it to start working on their roof, but usually this takes so long that a 3rd party has arrived. Especially if the other player has low ping, I find it to be just about impossible. Additionally, it feels like it's really hard to protect all of my sides from a 3rd party while pickaxing, because I don't want to just box myself in on top of them in case they place a trap, and I have to have at least 1 side open if I'm not directly on top. 
3. Alternate hitting their pyramids and walls, jumping up and down in hopes I can confuse them and place a wall/pyramid. This can work on less experienced players, but good players can edit through their roof and pyramid so quickly that as soon as I drop down to the side, they have already edited out and placed a ramp above me. 

That's pretty much all of my strategies. Does anybody have a recommendation on what to do? If a player is that good at defending their box, is it best to just sit on high ground and await the 3rd party? Then if it doesn't come, just play the high ground/circle rotation?",FortniteCompetitive

It started on the day of season 6, I excitedly came home from school to buy the battlepass, see the new update for myself and just play. But when I started playing I felt like all sorts of uncormfortable things. My left pinky finger started to hur (it normally doesn’t), I felt uncomfortable when shooting with ARs and even more so when I was in CQC. I’ve always been consistent at my shotgun shots but now it just feels like the opposite. I can’t spray at all with the smgs for some reason I’m really terrible all of the sudden and I don’t know why. I haven’t taken any breaks prior to season 6 so it’s not because I’m rusty. My buildings is good but it has felt better. Whenever I play any game now, especially solos I can’t hit the easiest of shots. I have around 450 wins and had a KD of 4 in season 5. Whenever I play my mind won’t stop running. It’s honestly kind of depressing for me how I from one day to the other gotten so bad. Even writing this right now brings a tear to my eye. I know it sounds dumb to be sad about being a little worse than usual at a videogame, but I love Fortnite to bits. I’ll hate hating playing Fortnite all because I’m not very good anymore. Also because it’s my main game and all my friends play it. I don’t know what my problem is, I’ve been so broken down by how frustating it is that I’m so bad all of the sudden. I’ve consistently been bad since season 6 started which I think was 5 days ago. I keep on pushing through thinking maybe I’m just having a bad day but I’ve had 5 bad days in a row. It was normal for me to one day be terrible and the next day feel like I was Ninja before sesson 6. I know a lot of people aren’t good and you might be thinking that’s it’s ok not to be good, but the thing is it’s stressing me out mentally, being terrible at my all time favorite game. I seriously don’t know what to do, do I take a break? Do I keep on pushing through feeling miserable? Or what? It feels like enemies’ skill level has tripled and my skills havd bee halved. I go into playground mode for 30 minutes before playing. I practice 90s, 180s, 1x1s and shotgun flickshots which I all do well in.

No. They never do.

* **You can't prioritize high kill games without deprioritizing placement**.

Suggestion: 

* 1st-10th = 1 Point. (Hell could make placement 0 points if you want!)

* 2 Kills = 1 Point

* 3 Kills = 2 Points

* 4 Kills = 3 Points

* 5 Kills = 4 Points

* 6 Kills = 5 Points

* 7 Kills = 6 Points

* 8 Kills = 7 Points

* 9 Kills = 8 Points

A Format that actually rewards high kill games and not placement. I'd be nice to move away from the box up meta in these tournaments just for a week.

How entertaining was DQ's 9 kill game last week? Arguably the most entertaining game of all the pro skirmishes. He actually build battled kids with minimal third partying. He attacked early and it was amazing!

With prioritizing kills, it would *hopefully* make early game engagements more common, thus decreasing box-up, third party kills. People would possibly land close to someone and get kills very early. And then rotate to hot spots when traveling the map.

I assume people gonna hate this, but I think it'd be the best format possible. Especially since the meta in all the tournaments has been the same since Summer Skirmish.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic introduced the build chopping during the moving circles, essentially to end heal offs. It didn't work perfectly, mainly because of the lag that the chopping caused.

But if they added back a circle that didn't close 100% of the way, then there would be no reason to attempt the heal off, as you would have to kill others since they could just sit in the circle and not take damage as well.

The only problem would be that if you got just two players left, one ultimate high ground and one ultimate low ground, then the only way to kill them would be to shoot up or down. There's a very solid chance that at least one party would run out of ammo, given how many times players are very low on ammo in end game of competitive situations.

The other possible situation is that a player tries to build up or down to the other player, which this would work, but at least the way the old zone worked, I believe it would be too small for a player to build up without taking storm damage.

There's easy fixes to this, like just leaving the zone at one tile large so players could build up or down without taking damage.

I don't think this is the final answer (especially as I am a fan of healoffs at times, especially when there is a duo team healing and one goes for the kill while the other heals) but I think this could be a potential fix for the time being until Epic can come up with something better.

First, a little background. I’ve been playing for a year now, and as my skills have increased dramatically, my KD has remained a constant 1.4ish the past few seasons. I say my skill has increased because the community at large has become so much better. So, although my KD is the same, it is the same with the better average player. I’m extremely competitive and when I see something like this with it’s extremely high skill gap, I see it as a personal challenge to get better. Call it a hobby to better myself. 

I’ve recently come across some information in a book about Flow that talks about the right amount of challenge to get better and enjoy the experience.  It talks about competition with others that are at about 5% better than you is the perfect environment in which to get better. If it’s much lower, you get bored. If it’s much higher, you get frustrated. 

Well, I’m getting extremely frustrated. These lobbies are full of people that just destroy me. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve just wanted to quit. But, I keep at it and ultimately don’t go anywhere with competing against these gods of Fortnite. 

Maybe it’s because I have a family and career and just can’t put in the time. Maybe it’s my nerves when I fight and get dumb.

If I really try to get the win(playing passive) and guarantee getting to late game, I can win probably 15-20% of the time. 

Also take into account that up until late June, i played very recreationally and sucked donkey balls, only racking up 10 solo wins since i started playing last October, (i know, fuck me right?) so that affects my W/R.  

Since then I have actively tried to get better(watched streamers/pros, and tried to mimic them, + grinded a lot) and am now sitting at 120 solo dubs. I would like to try my hand at a higher level in FNPL but don’t know if there is a stat requirement or if it is just open.

I've been having problems countering players who swanton on me when I'm in a 1x1 (Swanton = Launched on). I either panic and lose track of the player as he/she lands beside me and barrels stuff my ass or I place a trap on my inside wall at which point my opponent will land on the edge of my wall, build above me then have his/her way (Don't want to assume gender...).

Clearly, after a few deaths I went to the drawing board as I consider myself a fairly competitive gamer and this type of shenanigans was rubbing me the wrong way as I felt like a complete and total newb so this is what I came up with.

Make sure to have a spike trap equipped and keep a close eye on your opponent, it helps to shoot with pauses in between to give the impression that you're a complete and total bot. Once the opponent gets close and is about to land, jump up and immediately place a floor followed by the spike trap. It'll catch them in the air every time then its just a matter of slapping him/her with a shotgun/smg blast and its all over.

This strategy has been extremely effective and even if they try to bail out last minute, the trap will still sometimes catch them if they are within range. Makes it so much easier to counter and I find I panic a lot less.

Hope this helps!",FortniteCompetitive

I went further with that and went to replay on one of my matches and checked 100 player stats.
57% of the lobby had 400 wins at least, which is insane when you think about it 
23% had 200+
and 20% had 100+ not even one person had less than 100 wins in total.

After that i made a new account and played 1 solo game, after the game i checked all player stats:
this time only 36% of players had more than 150 wins highest being 134 total wins on the guy that won. 46% was under 100 and 18% had less than 50 wins. All these wins are overall lifetime wins if anyone is asking. The reason I said epic pulled a Bungie on us is that Bungie implemented skill-based matchmaking to destiny 2 without letting the player base know. I know that I could have done more research with the matches, but trust me. Checking 200 profiles takes quite some time.
Remember that this is just my theory, I decided to do this experiment because of all the posts about the game being hard in the current season.

Every single minute on the game has to be in playgrounds practicing a move, or watching specifics parts of scrims to learn. 

Practicing in playground is pretty self explanatory, practice things your not good at, analyze your gameplay and practice what you did wrong in a fight. 

When it comes to watching scrims, try to watch VODS that way you can skip the farming for a lot of the game, and just watch which fights they take, how they go about it. 

Finally, if I’m gonna be honest, if you only have 2 hours to play, or a small amount of time, consider doing a lot more practicing, then go maybe do 1 or 2 scrims at the end then play on league days (FNPL). Most people will disagree with this one, but a lot of scrimming is farming  mats and camping and whatnot, so it might not be as effective as practicing in playgrounds or on AimHero, or analyzing gameplay.

I've been an aggressive player ever since I started playing Fortnite it's just my preferred play style. 

I enjoy getting up front and personal and racking up as many kills as possible.

But to bring up my K/D I've been playing it more safe dropping at places with fewer people and then I try to rack up more kills in the mid to end game, but I don't get as many as I use to from dropping at high populated drop areas and getting as many kills as possible.

Do you guys think that having a high K/D is really important if so how can a player like myself who enjoys playing aggressively bring up his K/D?

I feel like the reason I'm having troubles bringing up my K/D is because I'll have games where I can get at least 10 kills or 5+, but then due to dropping in a high populated area and possibly dying at the very start of the game with 0 kills ruins that potential of bringing up my K/D

I love Fortnite, and I was thinking about a different take on a competitive tournament format. I'd love the feedback from /r/FortniteCompetitive to see what competitively-minded players might think of this.

Fortnite is obviously a *Battle Royale* game, which consists of last-man-standing gameplay in a lobby of 100 players. Competitive events in the past have generally used some kind of point-based system to quantify and differentiate skill between players (or duos, or squads), who queue into lobbies and simply play the game. Points are totaled up, and the winner has the most points (based on kills, wins, etc.).

But coming from the *fighting game community*, I was wondering about a different idea for comparing skill between players: **actual head-to-head battles**, now that we have fully cross-platform Playground. 

Here's what it would look like:

* Double elimination bracket
* Seeded bracket, based on metrics from stat-tracking sites
* Can be solos 1v1, or duos 2v2
* Each head-to-head match-up would consist of multiple battles, either best-of-three or best-of-five
* Winner's finals, loser's finals, and grand finals would be best-of-five or best-of-seven

The thinking behind this model is that instead of a point-based system with lots of potential RNG variables, and then trying to quantify which players are better than another, instead you actually get to put competitors up against one another head-to-head. You reduce RNG from random lobbies, what players happen to be in various games, etc. Fortnite is a legitimate skill-based game with a legitimately high skill-cap, which will allow the more skilled players to climb through the bracket to finals.

I was thinking about making the location Tilted Towers, since it's already a significant meta gunfighting battleground. Players would enter a lobby with their opponents in Playground mode, set up on opposite teams, and jump at Tilted. The ""round"" begins immediately upon jumping, so players can opt whether to rush their opponent, or spend more time looting, etc. The accelerated material-gathering in Playground mode is a *good* thing in this case, because building is such a significant component of where the skill-ceiling in the game lies; and more building vs. building also means higher-skilled players will (appropriately) win matchups.

A few questions:

1. What are some thoughts about this format generally?
2. What are some variables to bear in mind, or potentially unforeseen things? (such as with Playground mode, which I haven't used extensively, etc.)
3. What would be an effective manner of the players reporting the final score of the matchup? If I run these tournaments online as well as LAN events, I would like a tamper-proof manner of knowing winners, without bad actors manipulating the system or claiming to have won when they lost, etc.
4. Can you think of other things of note?

I appreciate any and all feedback!",FortniteCompetitive

There would be no need to have separate PS4/Xbox discords anymore.

Spray remains the main method of killing people, shotguns are underpowered, and building seems to be the one thing Epic doesn't like. Despite all this, there seems to be one thing that I've seen people complaining about over all else: the double barrel shotgun. 

I had a long discussion with a friend about this last night, and wanted some extra opinions. Now, don't let what I'm about to say make you think I don't believe the double barrel is very, very strong. However, I don't think it's overpowered.

So, what's the argument here? The main argument I've found that says the double barrel is OP is that it doesn't take much effort to 2tap someone right in their face. This is true. However, this doesn't make the double barrel overpowered because of something we call high-risk, high-reward. There is a LOT of risk, especially considering nerfs to the double barrel and grappler, plus the removal of bouncers, when it comes to getting in someone's face and 2tapping them. You're basically being forced to just push with ramps when using the double barrel now, and with items like the heavy sniper and with AR spam being as prominent as ever, you're bound to take a lot of damage in the process of getting to the player you're trying to kill. Plus, as players get smarter, they're learning to place traps when in very close quarter encounters with other players. If you miss your shots, odds are, you're dead. 

Obviously, there are exceptions to this, and the double barrel is still very powerful, especially in scrims and pro matches because of how small the zone gets. But considering the risks I just mentioned, I think the double barrel is in a relatively balanced state right now, and the real issue lies in buffing other shotguns. Please comment your own thoughts as I am genuinely curious as to what other people think.",FortniteCompetitive

In my case, me and my duo partner were top 6 for most of the duration of the league, but we did not fight as hard as we could have for the top spots as the reward for coming 1st was the same as 25th. Therefore we finished top 15, which is a comfortable position, however with todays announcement, I feel like we could've fought for the top 11 spot and claimed it, seeing as we've been top 6 for most of the league.

Furthermore I believe the ""pro league"" aren't recieving the top 11 duos as anyone in top 25 could be the top 11 as there wasn't a reason to play for top spots previously. Once you are in top 25 with a comfortable margin, you can try out new strategies etc that might not get you the most points, but can improve your play in the long term, this results in the top 11 being skewed by a large margin.

I am not saying we deserve to go to pro league, but I do believe that the decision was poorly made and should've been announced either previously to give people a fair chance or have allowed the entire top 25 to go into pro league, as those were the spots that were eligible for advancing.

Sorry for the rant, but I believe the decision is quite impactful in terms of the qualiy of players in the pro league and regarding peoples chances in general of getting in.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm speaking from my experience, you might have a different one

I would say if you are that kind of who for whom winning/stats/leaderboard is all that matters in a vidya, then Fortnite is one of the worst games to be addicted to

By addicted I mean playing one game exclusively

You just will not have a good time playing it at its current state and it won't be fun for as long as there is a huge casual crowd

There just too many ""anti-skill"" - but fun, things in this game that taking this game too seriously would leave you tilted or just annoyed

Epic is a business, so they will focus on whatever makes them the most money, for them balance is a secondary thing, they will proceed to lower the skill ceiling for as long as new things they add, make it fun for a casual crowd

I'm going to start off by saying that I play on Xbox (yeah yeah PC master race), and that I would consider myself a ""near-professional player.""

Here are some of my accomplishments to justify that statement.

**Overall Stats**

* Over 1,750 Wins
* Over 1,200 Duo Victories
* 25% W/L Ratio
* 4.0 KD
* Season 3 Global Duo Leader Boards (25th place w/ 475 Wins)

**Season 6 Stats**

* [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Brian270](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Brian270)

Now that you know that I'm not an incompetent bot, I'll tell you why I, as a top player believe that the removal of Bouncers is a good thing. I'll split this up into a few parts.

**Bouncer Skill Gap Issue**

Bouncers lowered the skill gap an incredible amount, some may argue the other way around, but typically high ground was given to the player with more Bouncers. While there are still ways to reach high ground without building (Grappler, Shockwave Grenades) these require you to use a slot in your inventory.

The Grappler still leaves you prone to fall damage, and once used, you will find yourself moving in an unchangeable trajectory. This allows good players to land a shot on you right as you land/approach them or place a trap as you land.

Shockwave Grenades only come in stacks of 2, and are hardly ever the right choice over healing or another weapon or utility item.

**Why Bouncers Were Overpowered**

* Bouncers gave immunity to fall damage
* Didn't take a slot in your inventory
* Had no max stack size
* Were usable in many situations

**Why Bouncers Don't Improve Late Game Play**

The Bouncer was typically used late game to launch yourself from a tower, or a large build to get yourself to the next zone without much risk of damage. I personally feel that without Bouncers in the game, there is a good time frame towards the end of the match that is more frantic and requires more skill to do well. You have to fight each other to reach the best position in the zone rather than just using a bouncer to reach zone.

**Possible Indirect Benefits**

* Opens up the possibility for some new traps, utility items.
* A rework of Bouncers so they are more balanced
* New Meta
* More interesting pro-league game play

That's all I have to say about the removal of Bouncers. I hope you consider reading the whole post before commenting a poorly thought out response, or a one word answer. Be less frightful of change and adapt to game play changes, we're not even a week into Season 6 and frankly if you're the guy/girl frantically typing into the YouTube comment section, ""Like this if Season 6 is the worst Season yet,"" you're probably an idiot. Thanks for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to provide a counter argument to the post about ""Bouncers being removed makes more RNG."" Couldn't you argue that the person who didn't have bouncers late game was unlucky and therefore at a disadvantage? It's Battle Royale, it's never going to lack RNG.",FortniteCompetitive

1. GRENADE LAUNCHER: Change the shooting pattern of the grenade launcher. It could have unlimited amo again or even leave it the way it is, however it can shoot 2 nades as quick as you can click then has to reload. This allows for good shots to still kill someone as the first will break the wall and if the second is timed will kill or damage the player. But it stops the constant spam that is overpowered af. 
2. ROCKET LAUNCHER: Rocket Launchers should have a distance buffer. They are unable to shoot within a certain 'close range' whatever that is in tiles or grid numbers. They are fine at a certain distance where there loud fire can be heard to negate the shot but in close quarters they are overpowered af unless you have superhuman reactions. Not sure if its possible to implement but i assume with the grappler deploy range it would be.
3. DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN: Although everyone seems to think its way overpowered, i actually disagree. It is super strong up close as it should be and takes a good 3 years to reload. However i believe its time in between shots should be delayed a few 0.x of a second just to take it back a notch or 2.
4. GRAPPLER: Nothing special with this one, i believe it ruins the whole point of building and gaining highground. Bring back the bounce pads and vault grappler, no question.

Let me know your thoughts, i would be really keen to see how 1. and 2. would work ingame instead of just vaulting everything that people complain about. Any other ideas would love to hear. Cheers",FortniteCompetitive

Changes

Shotguns:
-Double barrel vault
-Tightened spread on Pump and Tac

SMG’s:
-P90 vault
-Tightened spread on regular SMG
-Reduced structure damage of regular SMG
-Reduced player body shot damage to players. From 17,/8/19 to 16/17/18. Same headshot damage as before 34/36/38.
-Silenced SMG returned. Only found as uncommon and rare. Slightly reduced fire rate.

Assault Rifles:

-Vault silenced scar
-M-16/Scar Tightened spread for first 4 shots and gets wider as you keep shooting.
-M-16/Scar Damage reduction from 30/31/33/35/36 to 29/30/31/32/33
-Better range in terms of fall off damage.
-Increased recoil for all Assault rifles.
-Burst assault rifles decreased damage from 27/29/30/32/33 to 26/27/28/29/30.
-Thermal damage reduced from 36/37 to 34/35

Snipers

-Heavy sniper vaulted
-Bolt now has a 3 round mag. Must zoom out to load next round. Time in between shots is slightly faster than before but has a 2 Second reload.
-Increase hip fire spread on hunting rifle.


Explosives

-Added fall off splash damage to all explosives.
-RPG player damage reduced to 75/77/79 from 110/116/121 increased reload time.
-Grenade launcher fire rate decreased and damage reduced from 100/105/110 to 90/93/96
-Clinger rate of throws decreased.
-Grenade rate of throws decreased 

Miscellaneous items

-Minigun can overheat and slows down fire rate
-Grappler vaulted
-Bounce pads returned but take up an item slot with max stack size of 5. Drop in quantities of 1.
-Mini shields max stack size of 8

Reasons for these changes

Shotguns: 
They stand pretty balanced against SMG’s in close quarters however the pump needs a tighter spread to better rival the heavy. It would make better distinctions between headshots and body shot and be more consistent with higher damage headshots assuming you have the aim. Pump rewards body shots with less range, heavy rewards headshots with more range. Tac can be used more frequently with better spread. Not a big change but a change for the better.

SMG’s:

Increasing the spread and lowering body damage rewards headshots in close quarters to counter the current awful spread to SMG’s. Also a slower firing more accurate and more damage smg can be used as an alternative.

Assault rifles:

Having a spread model closer to that of the suppressed scar is ideal for assault rifles as long as the damage is reduced to balance it out. Recoil would also be something to deal with so not just anyone can laser someone down that easily. These numbers are somewhat arbitrary and would require a lot of testing to find the right balance but the idea is better accuracy for less damage.

Sniper Rifles:

I would like to see the magazine actually utilized in the bolt action so this is my best idea to do it without making it overpowered. Heavy sniper has no place as it is a 1 shot to the body to most players and can break walls and has less bullet drop. The game is better without it.

Explosives: 

They should be a decent counter to building but not to building and players. The spam should also be lowered as it is hard to counter constant grenades/rockets.

Miscellaneous: 

Mini gun could really use an overheat function to balance it against someone’s building. Can be used as more of a material drain.
Grappler is simply overpowered against building and the bounce pad is a better alternative as long as it takes an inventory slot. 

Final thoughts

**RANKING** | **TEAM** | **SUMMARY**
---|---|----
1 | Liquid | Team Liquid has proven to be a powerhouse in the early stages of competitive Fortnite. Making up 4 of the top 6 highest earners thus far. Vivid's Summer Skirmish dominance, Poach's consistency, and Chap and Tom high placings have made them the most impressive team. Their late-game situational awareness is only matched by the next team on this list.
2 | Ghost(1) | The first Ghost Gaming squad made up of Dmo, Bizzle, Saf, and Ghoul come in at 2nd on this list. Dmo and Bizzle have proven to be one of the most successful duos so far in the Skirmishes. Pairing that with Bizzle’s strong solo performances putting Bizzle as the highest earner in Fortnite right now. Saf and Ghoul consistently acquiring wins makes this squad one of the more impressive late game teams.
3 | Atlantis | Team Atlantis is the first EU squad to make an appearance on the list largely due to the strong performances from Mitr0. He is the highest European earner as of right now and   is an extremely gifted late game player. If the rest of the team are given more opportunities in the Skirmishes, it is likely that they will see similar success.
4 | Ghost(2) | Ghost Gaming’s newly signed second squad undoubtedly deserves a spot in the top 5 after their electrifying performance in Fall Skirmish week 2. thwifo placing 2nd, Snood 3rd, Kayuun 5th, and Sean 11th in the solo skirmish makes for an extremely successful debut for this squad.
5 | FaZe | FaZe could definitely place higher on this list depending on how you determine the placing. It began with their dominance in the Fortnite Friday format, and has translated fairly well into the more traditional battle royale format. Tfue earning first place in the skirmish with two wins out of the six games played is outstanding. It’ll be interesting to see how the rest of the squad does with  more opportunities in the Fall Skirmish.
6 | Solary | Solary has been arguably the most consistent team on the European side. With Kinstaar being another one of EU Fortnite’s stars that have emerged making him the 3rd highest European earner. Him and Hunter placed 1st overall in week 1 of the Fall Skirmish by a fairly large margin at 19 points with the next best acquiring 11.
7 | Secret | Team Secret is one of the most interesting cases in the competitive scene. Their continued success in the EU scene has been undeniable. Mongraal has become one of the most talked about players in the competitive scene but due to his age, he has not been able to compete in the Skirmishes. Even with that handicap, they have proven to be among the best. Sak0ner’s performance in the latest skirmish was outstanding placing 3rd overall.
8 | Gentside | Gentside is another European team to standout thus far. They’ve had a fair amount of success in other European tournaments outside of the Skirmishes. TheVic was the second highest earning European in the Summer Skirmishes and we’ll be watching to see if they continue their success in the Fall Skirmishes.
9 | Envy | Team Envy is the next team to appear in the rankings despite not quite having the same success in the skirmishes as the 8 above them. Their achievements include Gorilla, LeNain, and scatch all performing fairly well at Pax West and a 2nd place finish in the FN Pro League only behind Ghost Gaming.
10 | Sentinels | The last team to finish off the top 10 is Sentinels. They are frequently involved in the late game of both scrims and skirmishes with Animal and Corose both performing fairly well in the Fall Skirmish thus far. A 15th place duos finish in Week 1 and a 19th place finish for Carose in Week 2 has them barely cracking the top 10 in this weeks rankings.

I decided to rank based on the teams predicted squads rather than purely based on organizations and every player they've signed. The reason I did this was because it's more fair to rank based on the performance of players rather than the number of players each org has signed giving them a significant advantage in placings. This is not a slight at Ghost or Faze because clearly signing a lot of players is smart, it just makes it less interesting to rank and the discussion would ultimately just come down to ""Ghost has more players finishing higher"" which isn't fair to players who have limited control over who their org signs outside of their own individual squads.

If there are any errors that you have noticed, please let me know. Some of the information isn't super easily accessible so it's very possible I screwed up somewhere with stats/team info/etc.

If you disagree with the rankings, let me know! I'd love to hear feedback and to have this list generate some discussion on where each team should be ranked.",FortniteCompetitive

The normal argument is that having custom lobbies made for scrims is that then pros can practice in a lobby full of other pros and be more ready for the tournaments. While that's great and all, that's not the argument I'm making.

There's constantly posts about why the production side of the Skirmish needs to be better, especially the casters. We ask for more knowledge and more analysis. 

If Epic were to host custom lobbies made for pros, then they will have access to tons of information. Right now when you watch scrims, they get maybe 20 team lobbies, which helps tons for end game situations, but you see very few early game fights and only a few mid-game fights.

Epic can use the info around these custom lobby scrims to see what players ideal loadouts are, like you could learn that Cloak will pick up a sniper over explosives, you can learn exactly where all the teams drop and what their playstyles are.

This will allow the casters to have way more info, like when you see a fight above tunnel at Tomato, if Poach &amp; Vivid are fighting, you know Tom &amp; Chap will be nearby. You can also create better storylines, by not just using what players have done in past events, but also how they've been playing in recent scrims. You see too often that Poach &amp; Vivid will win a scrim game with 15 kills.. But only 7 of those were scrimmers and they won a lobby that didn't have their teammates or any of the Ghost duos. In a lobby full of pros, they wouldn't have been able to farm 3k mats, loot containers &amp; Tomato and late game with 50 players would be different than late game with 30. Having a scrim with a full lobby of pro players and getting the stats from those would give Epic the chance to talk about player's performances lately (like so &amp; so has won 5 games in the last week, giving him a 7% win rate OR so &amp; so is averaging 6 kills per match over the last 3 days).

This would also give Epic a chance to see how different items are affecting the competitive meta, and make changes with more knowledge on how it will change that side of the gameplay.

The only downsides to this would be that it would takeaway from the tournament streams, as that has the advantage of being the only lobby that is full of pro players, but the tournament still has large amounts of money on the line, which makes it a must watch. The other problem would be looking at the pro discord for NA East, they were queuing for scrims the other day with 60 duos. That means that if they did custom lobbies, this would still mean some people would be left out.

**TL;DR: Custom games for scrims would give Epic casters access to more information to provide insight &amp; analysis, as well as the ability to create storylines. Epic could also use the data to better sculpt the competitive meta they are happy with.**",FortniteCompetitive

The bot that goes by the name of Whipper Sniper was designed mainly for servers that hosts scrims. This bot is user friendly, 

very easy to use and has been rigorously tested with a large amount of scrimmers (300+). 
To start off, once the bot joins your server, it will automatically make a catergory which will look like this 

**https://imgur.com/a/Ot1mWFv** (**1st Picture**)

**https://imgur.com/a/Ot1mWFv** - As I explain the features of the bot, I will be referring to the pictures in the imgur link I 

just posted for you to better visualise how it works.

The bot is fully automated so once you start a session, there wont be a need to do anything apart from changing the game-mode 

which can be done with 1 command and the bot doesn't need to be stopped for that.
There will be 2 countdowns per hour, you can choose the time for example every 25 past/55 past of every hour, here's a few 

examples **(2nd Picture)** 
Command will be ws/start 28 for example and the bot will automatically do a CD every 28 and 58 minute of any hour

The bot will send a notification 5 minutes, 1 minute and 20 seconds before every CD which will look like this **(3rd Picture)** 

 (This only shows the 20 second one, same message different time)
The bot will also type GO in the scrim-codes chat at the same time the bot says it in the voice channel **(4th Picture)**

The #scrim-codes channel will then be opened up for around 3 minutes in which scrimmers can then post their codes in, at the 

same time, a bracket will be formed in #brackets which will update simultaneously. It will then look like this **(5th Picture)

** and if there's a lot of players inputing their codes and there's no more space in the message box, it will then make an 

entire new one like so **(6th Picture)** 
All players in single servers will be at the bottom **(7th Picture)** and it will show the amount of players / servers that 

have been inputed. The chat will then auto lock followed by this message **(8th Picture)**

Scrimmers will have access to a command (ws/cd) which will be auto deleted by the bot followed by a PM that would look like 

this **(9th Picture)**
 
That summarizes what the bot has to offer. It's fully automated and will make your life easier as a server owner. If you are 

interested or know someone that may be interested, please PM me on reddit and we can work on getting the bot in your server for 

a trial run to see if you like what you see. Aside from this bot, for a reasonable price, we are more than willing to make 

other custom bots. Just hit my Dms. In addition to all of that the bot will be hosted by us and if there's any issues you 

encounter, we are just one PM away.

#We plan to offer a free trial for any servers that are interested, we can get to pricing and negotiations in private 

thereafter. It will be a one off payment and the bot will be at your disposable till the end of time.",FortniteCompetitive

- still no elimination incentives as of S6 (like giving mats / hp / shield on an elimination)
- no increases to material gathering / speed, almost forcing you to spend over 60% of the match farming for mats, unless you find a llama / kill someone with a lot of mats.

But then, g-sync does add a little bit of input lag but its such a small fraction and at 240 hz its almost impossible to see so maybe the pros don't even want that small fraction of input lag?

I have been using a g-sync monitor for almost 2 years now and I am very much used to it and could tell the difference when I turn it off, so my choice stays the same but I was wondering what the pros use. Some of the pros currently using g-sync include, ninja, tfue, replays, all the liquid boys with their AW2518H, HD, symfuhny, nick eh 30, just to name a few you get the point.

The pbp caster gives a running commentary of the action in real time. The analyst adds on with analysis in between plays. 

Good play by play casting makes great moments legendary.

[Example of this in football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJzpoj_NxqQ)

Each number represents the probability that you come out of that location with an item in the respective slot. \`Kitted\` means you came out with an AR, Shotty, SMG, 100 shields, and at least 100 shields in your inventory.  


For Example - \`Containers\` has a 6.2% of having 0 shields, 21% chance of having 50 shields, 2.7% chance of having 75 shields, and 70.4% chance of having 100 shields. There is a 97% chance you get an AR, 98% chance you get a shotgun, and 87% chance you get an SMG.

I assume he had to have been a console player his whole life to reach this level of consistency with his shotgun whereas sypherpk for example, a well known pc player has become one of the better players on pc even though it was his first fps game. 

Even though this is in some ways a console vs pc debate I am not saying that pc is far better, however I am saying that pc players are more likely to step into the pro scene than console players. What do you guys think? I am open to have my mind changed ",FortniteCompetitive

«Hello everybody, so this is what I think about current state of Fortnite's e-sports and what's going wrong and how to improve from the mistakes they keep making over and over again.

So first of all a little bout my self, I'm EU ""pro"" and been playing on the highest level of Fortnite for about 8 months now. I've played countless amount of customs games, snipes, leagues, watched hundreds of hours of VODs and streams and analyzed a lot about the competitive side of Fortnite. Also have competed in Skirmish.

I'm not gonna talk about who is currently playing in FallSkirmish and how they chose the players etc.
Please do not comment before you actually read the whole thing.

So what's really going wrong with Fortnite's e-sport?

1-FORMAT
2-THE ""META""
3-VIEWER EXPERIENCE
4-LITTLE INFORMATION/IMPULSIVE

**1-FORMAT**

To me and to a lot of competitive players this is the biggest thing that's going wrong for Fortnite currently. You just can't put a format that MOSTLY cares about kills into a battle royale game. It is so luck based and so bad compared to other formats that we've had in competitive scene for long time now.

So yesterday's Solo Format was utterly bad. Only way to get points from placement was to survive untill last zone cause everytime there were 5 people alive in ""heal-of zone"". There is no reward for being consistent as its heavily rng based to get to top 5.

**Elimination focused format.**

Personally I don't really like kill-based format, but it might work. This time however, it was executed poorly. You needed 3 kills to get 1 point. Why don't you just give point from every kill and add bonuses after threshold? You literally were in top 20 with only 3 points. That's 9 kills in 6 games.

**What's wrong with it? Why is it bad?**

So to understand why Epic Games is pushing this format is to understand the viewing experience. There has been alot of circle-jerking and negativity against Epic Games as their e-sports is ""boring to watch"". Games are boring, people are just sitting in 1x1 and playing really carefully. So they force this kill-based format to counter the boring viewing experience.

Even tho this doesn't change anything. Players still play carefully as THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO GET KILLS IS TO SURVIVE TO LATEGAME. And this is why kill-based format is bad. The ""Meta"" is to play same as you would when you want get good placement. And these formats we've seen doesn't award your consistency enough, they award luck and punish mistakes too much. Razzeroo literally came 2nd yesterday by playing 1 game. He had same amount of points as the winner of the Skirmish.

**So what's good format then?**

Format that gives you points for EACH placement and EACH elimination. IE. 50 points per kill and and placements go something like 75-100 20 points, 50-75 50 points, 40-50 70 points, 30-40 80 points, 20-30 100 points, 15-20 120 points, 10-15 150 points etc.

And if you want more rewarding for kills, just add the points you get per kills and make ""bonus"" points after set amount of kills.

This awards consistency and BR is all about consistency. (At least should be.) I came up with this format in about 2 minutes, so it's not good, but even this is better than what's used atm.

There have been a lot of good formats in the competitive community and I would love Epic to ask them what they think would work as they have put the most amount of time thinking them through and testing different formats.(bush paranoia.)

**2-THE META**

So everybody is talking about ""turtle-meta"" and how to get rid of it. Well simple answer; you can't. Its the most effective way to get kills, stay safe and be consistent. And people complaining it makes the game boring, No it doesn't. What makes the game boring is bad spectating tool. There's ALWAYS somebody fighting and you just miss it cause of the bad spectating tool. It's not the meta that's bad, it's the viewing experience.

This moving circle is really good for the game in my opinion, but it's too far right now. You have to move A LOT to get to the destination and I feel like you can't be consistent with it cause of materials.

You can't predict that or counter it. You can make it ""easier"" for you by going to middle circle and to obtain high ground BUT you will ran out of mats if the zone is not good for you. Before last patch the zones were better as you didn't have to go as far as you have to go now, even tho circles move slower now.

I think Epic didn't think this fully as there is no way you acquire enough materials for the whole game currently.

**What to change and do they really need to get rid of ""turtling""?**

There should be different values to how much materials you get from different things in different game modes. In solos it's almost impossible to get enough as its only you farming and you have to consider looting and position as well. If you farm a lot of mats, your position is bad or you might not have looted enough. And if you don't farm enough, you just gonna die cause of running out.

Definitely don't get rid of turtling. It's really action based late-ish game and I feel like its quite balanced with different format as well.

**3-VIEWER EXPERIENCE**

There's multiple things going wrong currently. The worst is the spectating tool. People were really hyped around it and it shows great amount of things BUT it still doesn't provide the biggest thing that we want. Action. There's loads of times when we spectate wrong people and that's why it's so boring. We miss fights, we miss all the pokes, snipes, the outplays, everything. I'm confident it gets better when time passes tho.

Casters really get a lot of hate but I think it's mostly cause of they don't know a lot of what's happening and aren't familiar with players and stuff that's going around. It will fix itself when time has passed and casters have been around with the e-sports longer. I mean, CSGO casters have been into CS for 10-15 years, no wonder they're so good at casting.

No live scoreboard (well yes, but not actually live), no indications who is who and what's happening and a lot of confusion.

**4-LITTLE INFORMATION/IMPULSIVE**

So viewers and players don't know what happening. Players get notified 20 hrs in advance who is playing and sometimes as little as 2 hours before games start. We can't plan the days and I don't know the reasoning about this. There's no information about formats, who plays, what to do etc about these things. really weird. They change so many things just in few hours notice and it's hard to adapt. The shadowstones came back to the game literally 20 minutes before games started. season 6 started 1 day before 300k tourny started.

Just let us play the last patch if there's so little time between tournament and patch. They also might ban items between games, like they put in the announcement channel between games ""oh btw, port-a-fortress is banned from now on as it causes server stability issues"" and they banned c4 in the middle of Summer Skirmish as well and everybody didn't even know. This is not good.

So this is what I think is going wrong with e-sports currently, hopefully this might start some conversation about the real problems and maybe people stop complaining about the not so important stuff ie. ""spam meta, kills not giving enough"" etc.

No TLDR as its important to read fully.»",FortniteCompetitive

380,w_domaje,1538220477,9jvunz,35,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9jvunz/double_shotgun/,1,Double Shotgun,"TL;DR at the bottom

There is a surprising amount of people who don't like the idea of double pump being reintroduced to the game. I half understand why...during season 2 and 3, double pump was quite OP and you could do 400+ damage in 2 seconds (if you hit your shots). However, in season 4 this wasn't a problem; Epic kinda fucked the pullout delay trying to nerf double pump, which worked, but also screwed over single pump. They have fixed this now but for a while this was irritating, especially after they removed double shotgun completely. I'm all for not adding back double pump, or double heavy, or whatever; wanting to carry two versions of the same weapon is just a bad game mechanic. However completely removing double shotgun, nerfing the pump and the tac into the ground and  buffing SMG's was dumb. Now, instead of actually fixing the root of the problem Epic are just putting out fires where they come up. SMG's are now 'balanced' in some regards, but you can't build with wood against an SMG because they've nerfed wood into the ground as well. They're trying to subtly nerf building, arguably their only skill gap. They said that they wanted to allow a variety of playstyles when they capped the amount of rockets that you can carry; now, you can essentially play with three presets or your chances of winning a game, even as a skilled player, are so incredibly slim. 

AR- Double Shotgun-SMG -Grappler

AR-Double Shotgun - Grappler

Double Shotgun-SMG- Grappler

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you can replace one of these with a dual Beretta but they arent that good honestly. The people who are saying fuck double shotgun are the same people who enjoy the double barrel-grappler  combo. Which brings me to my next point. Double barrel. What a fucking abomination. 150 to the chest before this recent nerf? If you are close enough to someone with one of these things, the person with the double barrel will win. All the time. The only downside of this gun was that you couldn't often get close enough to use it. SO HERE COMES THE GRAPPLER. As a big fuck u to the skilled players, Epic introduced this thing to fuck with peoples heads. You have high ground? Not anymore you fucking don't mate, you're dead because they've just grappled into your face and hit you twice with a double barrel. It's such a slap in the face for Epic to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Aiming is also just shite. Why is bloom still in this game its such a bad mechanic. Honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, this game will die if they carry on like this. It's subtle, but they've been closing the skill gap ever so slightly every update. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, Building got nerfed, Editing got nerfed, Shotguns got nerfed, SMG's got buffed then nerfed,then here comes the double barrel and if you don't use it you're fucked. It's nerf or nothing. 

I'm interested to hear other peoples opinions and I urge you to watch Ged's videos on how epic should improve the game, he makes some really good points.",FortniteCompetitive

Fortnite is certainly a very 'jumpy' game and no matter what you will probably find yourself jumping a lot. Jumping while traversing the map is generally a good idea, because you will be very hard to hit from a distance as it will be difficult to track you with an AR or Sniper.

However, jumping is not always the best thing to do in a close quarters fight. This is because, once you have started the jump, the arc is easily predictable - entirely the opposite to what you want your movements to be. You want your movements to be dynamic and unpredictable which can be accomplished by a combination of strafing, crouching and jumping. Additionally, jumping can negatively impact your aim is it can be difficult to jump and shoot.

I’m not sure what you guys can do to help, but I wanna change and make improvement so I thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask for help/suggestions.",FortniteCompetitive

It would be suicidal for a player to use one on a competitive event with the best players in the world all around you just waiting for you to make a mistake. 

This is the exact reason why there Fortnite should always have one player with some type of in game sense to point these things out. Zeke is fine when he is is with Nick Eh, Nickmercs, or Lupo because they all know the game. But when it's 2 people casting who no idea what they are talking about I'm just wondering what is their point.

Question: Will I improve if I play scrims even tho I cant win pubs consistently, or it will be a waste of time? to win pubs for me I have to camp my D\*\*\* off and get 1 or 2 kills. I land titled every game get 1-3 kills and die or leave titled with 5 kills more or less and choke.  should I play so much pubs that  I'm good enough to win consistently then scrims?

My main issue is solos. It feels so random. I almost always end up fighting a guy who just turtles all day until I get 3rd-4th-5th partied. I get very frustrated watching players like poach / tfue play solos because it feels like whatever play they do, they never face the ""bullshit"" situations I face which is probably not true. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. I can end fights quite fast, most of my wins are 14-15-16 kill games but never gone over 18. I can get up to 10 winstreak in solos if I play it like a scrim game, but obviously that'd be the most boring thing to do getting 3-4 kill wins.

I've casted Rainbow 6 Siege and CS:GO, and meshing with a co-caster takes a lot of time together. Meanwhile, they've got Zeke with a new guy every week and you can tell that they have difficulty meshing. 

He did well during Lupo's week because they also casted the Pro-Am and Ninja's thing together and Lupo has a pretty natural flow.

 I feel bad, because Zeke has potential but is stuck trying to figure out a new flow each week. 

A few other things I'd note would be Zeke constantly trying to tell the story from the player's perspectives, which is fine every now and then in short bits. It also sucks that he carries the same Twitter plugging joke across every single stream. I understand wanting to spread the love and promote his co-casters, but it really takes away from the show. 

I'm not saying Zeke is a bad caster. As I said, there's tons of potential there. I think Epic needs to just secure a co-caster for him rather than forcing him to adapt every week. A pair that has time to mesh is way better than someone trying to be different every week. ",FortniteCompetitive

I started at the end of season 3 and have played a lot season 4 and 5. So I'm setting some goals for myself, some realistic some a bit of a reach:

1. 2.0 KD in all formats - this should be manageable in solos since that was a 1.9 KD season 5. But duos and squads were around 1.25 KD so those will be tougher

2. 7% win rates - 5% win rate in season 5 and for the first half I wasn't getting any wins

3. fix bad habits - such as making sure to stop and heal in a fight, not taking damage from rockets I shot, not getting sniped so often

4. don't do the weekly challenges if I'm repeatedly getting killed doing them - either wait or do it in 50v50

5. Rush people more - take on more fights. Don't be satisfied with 2-3 wins at the beginning and then trying to get 1st

6. Better building - better defensive building when I'm caught off guard, making sure to get high ground and staying high ground

7. Master variety of spots - I was pretty good at landing at 2-3 different places but it also would become boring after a while. Then it felt like a chore

8. In squads try to figure out game volume to chat volume balance - I struggle with this with my Turtle Beach on XB1 since when I'm farming or shooting or whatever I can't hear my teammates

9. Find an additional squad from my friends - they're not always on, plus feel like I could sometimes play with better players than them since I'm the best in the squad. I'll use the discord for this

445,Janukenasl,1538148322,9jnwkb,24,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9jnwkb/speed_of_na_and_eu_players/,2,Speed of NA and EU players,"Are there any NA players who build insanely fast, like the kind of fast where it's hard to understand whats happening.

In EU I've been seeing so many people pop up who are so incredibly fast, like magin, juganza, mongraal and any players they play against. Whats the weirdest for me they don't just build fast and overbuild everywhere, from what I've seen they build efficiently as well and their shotgun aim is on par or at least not far of of the NA pros. So in terms of mechanical skill (from my perspective) NA is currently outclassed however I just might not be informed enough and there might be the same speedy players in NA as well. If that is the case, could anyone direct me to those players ttv or yt?

Now for the next part, with the big backlash when making slow and win centred tourneys will Epic move over to more kill centred ones and how do you think the two different regions would compare. This is in no way me trying to fuel the ""hurr durr my region is better than your region"" debate, just something interesting to talk about, for example if the more gun skill reliant NA is better at fights than the more mechanical skill reliant EU",FortniteCompetitive

The sweats are more accurate, and they don't waste time building as much as console sweats so it feels way less likely to get third partied and much faster. The bots are actual bots and I don't have to worry about getting tagged because of aim assist on our bots.

Also not sure if I was streamsniped or what but fought the same guy 3 matches out of 10 so that was interesting.

Most importantly I want to hear from fellow console sweats what your thoughts are vs the two types, and if I'm the only one that gets 15 more ping on crossplay vs regular console lobbies.

Personally I think If you're really a competitive console player, you should get into the pc lobbies as well as legitimate scrim lobbies.

Here's why.,"So, it's not a hidden fact or some form of secret that bounce pads were extremely useful in a load of situations; getting out of the storm, getting higher jump pad launches, jumping up on people who you're build fighting and finally the main use would be to get off high-ground after a build fight. That's a whole lot of good uses, and practically 0 downsides, other than the obvious one that others can use them. 

It's probably a fact that everyone reading this sub, has used a bouncepad in order to launch up to someone overbuilding their 1x1's, to rejoin their height and continue the fight at a fair point, or to get above them and get a shot or two off, practically requiring very little skill; you just need to know how to place a ramp/floor and use a trap slot item, along with shooting. Anybody could do it; and it was powerful, especially with the introduction of the DB. Alongside that, coming off from a build fight was very strong too, because it was a guarantee that if you've been shot down and you can place it that you will survive the fall, no matter the situation. 

So, based on all of the uses and abilities with the lack of drawbacks, I think it's definitely a great thing to have removed, and will likely help to ease the skill-gap back into a more build-skill based one, as opposed to just using the variety of mobility items to get around and fight. Though, I can agree that I will miss it for coming off a large height, but it's not like we're without another option; you can shockwave off, or you can launchpad off, both viable strategies for getting safely away from high-ground. You could also rift, though it's unlikely to be the most effective.

If you play late at night like me (NAE after 11 pm EST), you probably have experienced a huge uptick in competition recently, yet again. 

I have been pretty amazed with the level of competition the last few nights. It has gotten to a point though, where the game is really changing for me. I'm not like the pros, so I can't finish fights insanely fast like they do, but I consider myself an above average player (3.0 k/d, 10-15% win rate try-harding). This change has affected my game play severely, in that I get in numerous huge build battles in a row these days. Before this week, I would only get in long, huge build fights every few games, because usually I could finish players quickly, or shut them off from high ground easily. It is at the point where if I want to have even a decent chance end game, I have to entirely change my strategy. If I want to win, I essentially have to avoid fights entirely, or only pounce on late 3rd party opportunities. 

I think it can be deceiving watching pro players play mid-day and think you can do the same at night, even if you're a very good player. I made this post just to say no, it's not you playing bad, there has been an especially high level of competition lately, and it will only continue to rise in pubs until competitive mode is released.

I understand this. Theoretically, with now only 2 SMGs in the game, one of which is seen as garbage by a lot of people, it opens up a spot for other weapons / items. This is good yeah? 

Although I'm all for a little innovation, from playing about 7 hours of season 6, it's become quite clear that people are replacing this slot with RPGs, nade launchers, and miniguns. Probably regarded as the worst weapons to play against,  as they are difficult to counter and waste ALOT of materials to counter.

Now think of a game of squads where, in a squad of 4, 2 have miniguns and 2 have RPGs or nade launchers. How the fuck are you supposed to push against that? Even if the opposing squad manages to somehow waste all of opposing teams ammo, they will have zero mats left whilst the other team has only used a couple hundred. 

**TL;DR** My point of this rant? IMO if Epic released an LTM with no RPG, nade launcher, or minigun people would love it. I just don't think such weapons belong in a Battle Royale. And **I know** Epic has a tendency to push the boundaries of what belongs in a BR, but, in this case I can't see a good meta for squads and duos arising any time soon with previously mentioned spam weapons in the game.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

Timestamps:

10:18 I was walking into tomato and saw a battle. I decided to not fight the guy but we did get pretty close. Not sure how I could have handled this better

14:00 I saw an ATK parked and thought the guy was still in it, he was just down the hill a little and I killed him with a spray from my SCAR. I could have built a little here because I was in the open.

17:28 I decided to fly up to middle island to get height advantage, I knew there was going to be at least 1 person up there and there was. This was my first real fight of the match. We had a small build battle and I won because of my amazing gamer skills ^(not luck at all lmao) . 

19:15 I was going back to the loot after healing to find a guy going to my loot as well. I ended up killing him with an smg spray that wasn't very good but it got the job done.

20:54 This is when everything starts to end. At this point I am sitting in a port-a-fort hoping the circle plays for me. I saw a guy lauchpad off of middle house near to where I was. He tried to fight me but he decided to lauchpad down to the campsite. 

21:40 My game froze for a couple of seconds here, I got stuck in the storm for a little but not a lot of time. I took the lauchpad that the other guy took down to the campsite. I land at the campsite, hear him near me and headshot him with a heavy. Now it is a 1v1 and the other guy is behind me. He shoots me so I build up a little to get high ground and I start spraying him with an smg, he has a minigun. He knocks down my little build so I am forced to go and fight him. I fall down to the ground while still spraying the smg and he is spraying the minigun. This fight went on for a little too long and he should have won. I ended up winning because he switched from his minigun to a shotgun, maybe he was out of ammo? 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended this match with 5 kills, My first kill was with 11 people alive including me, I was playing very passive.

Here are my two reasons (one minor &amp; one major) as to why the damage should be reduced from 150 to 125. 

Minor issue 1: Early game you usually find 1 big shield or 3 minis, making your hp 150. If you land Tilted Towers early game, you really don't want to be paranoid that you can't hunt people in buildings because there may be a randomly placed spike trap. Spike traps aren't hard to look for but it really slows down the pace of your early game hunting if you are checking every ceiling and wall for a spike trap. At least if you want to hold W through Tilted buildings you can knowing they only do 125, but 150 seems too high especially for early game. 

Major issue 2: Build fights are way too easy to win when you get ramped over because of spike traps instantly activating and doing 150 damage. It has gotten to the point where if I have a trap I purposely bait others into ramping over me so that I can cone them and usually get a free kill with the spike trap. The majority of players float around 150hp as opposed to 200 hp so most players don't live through this. If traps did 125, at least a player who got spike trapped would live with 25hp and have a chance to reset the fight and heal or disengage with whatever mobility they are holding. Of course good players will cone + floor above them and edit through in build fights to avoid getting killed by spike traps but the majority of the player base can't sprint through a pyramid + floor editing above them in build fights atm. When spike traps did 75 damage that was too low because even using two spike traps couldn't kill a 200hp player but at least with 2x 125 damage spike traps you would still kill any player. This just seems like better balancing imo and I would like to see this minor adjustment.

TLDR: 75 damage was too low, 150 is too much, 125 = perfect. Let me know your thoughts",FortniteCompetitive

As for Tfue and Cloak, they confirmed late and didnt get an invite to week 1, and imagine the backlash Epic would have received if they hadnt invited them two weeks in a row, because of their large fanbases.

I see these professional players with 2 to 3000 wins and it’s absolutely mind blowing.

Where do I go from here? As an Xbox player from the EU, it’s next to impossible to play scrims from a discord unless I want 300 ping.",FortniteCompetitive

**1.** No matter what your edit button is, confirming your edit will always be Circle/B.

**2.** Flipping R2 with R1 (shooting button) doesn’t allow you to edit with R1, you must draw in your edit with R2 even though you’ve binded R1 

**3.** Binding *any* action to R3/RS prevents you from being able to reset edits.

Epic could fix this by making them not launch you as high when placed on a floor so it's still a mobility item and way to get off of high buildings without being shot down aswell as not being cheesy in a build

They nerfed the double barrel and the grappler and the *top* comment is ""i dont even care really, give me bouncers"". 

This is the wrong mentality to have. Lets go back to the beginning of season 5. People crying about the game dying. C4s destroying trump tower in 1 stack. Clingers godly. Build health nerfed. Smgs buffed to stupid levels.

And its all gone. They nerfed c4 til they vaulted it. Nerfed smgs til they vaulted most of them including the infamous *drum gun*. Nerfed clingers. Nerfed double barrel. Nerfed the grappler. Removed the lmg spam. Added another mobilty mechanic that also helps with disengaging after getting third partied. Changed the storm multiple times to nerf turtling. You get the point.

Enjoy the game. This was a great patch.",FortniteCompetitive

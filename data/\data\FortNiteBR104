Some people are arguing that Onesie is actually the counterpart to Beef Boss, however the  errors with that are that Onesie is the battle pass skin in question, and that would imply that the Nightshade/Tomatohead skins are counterparts as well.

Nonetheless, I'd kill to see a Black Panther-type skin as Lynx's counterpart, or even Female Trog. Open to discussion and suggestions as to what you guys believe we may be getting. Perhaps one of the banners in the pass is a hint?

I cannot be the only one who feels like trash when playing this game nowadays.  
The skill gap has been insane lately I feel like, I cannot spend 8 hours a day playing this game to ""git gud"".  

This game was such fun, before it got blown up with tournaments.
Now 9/10 I'm getting rekt by a TTV guy who one pumps me after boxing me in.  

Anyway, from the 15 people I knew who played this game with me since S1, only 1, ONE is still playing with me.  All other people have given up, it's just a game to have fun not to get rekt by people who play this game 8hrs + a day.  
Please give us a fair ranked matchmaking system already EPIC.  I feel like the casual players will continue to play less or quit the game.  Even me, I'm close to just stop, I don't have fun anymore getting destroyed by every player in the lobby

I started back in season 2 and fell in love with this game. By season 3 i really felt like I was an above average player. My buddy and I used to always joke that we would “tier up” as we played. Meaning whenever we squad wiped, whenever we got a good win, etc we would always say “I think we just hit tier 9 dude!” as far as our skill level. 
We used to jump into squads with just the two of us, no fill, and get wins. (CONSOLE btw).

But over the past two months or so it just feels like everyone has passed us by. I feel like I get outbuilt about 65% of the time. And I feel like I get outedited about 80% of the time. I’ve messed around with the controls to improve my editing, turbo building, etc but it’s so hard to keep up.
We play pop ups and we get our 20 points but especially against the PC guys we get CLAPPED 9/10.

It feels like we rarely talk about tiering up anymore. 

I used to win about 10% of my games. It’s gotta be like 6% the last season or two. My aim still feels on point, but that doesn’t matter when bloom can screw your over. 
My tactics and smarts are there with rotations and when to engage etc, but people just fly around and rift etc non stop.

It feels like the general player base has all improved drastically with builds and edits and I was ONCE ahead of the average player base and suddenly they’ve blown by me.

Not sure if there’s other guys out there like me. I wanna work on improving but I also don’t have all the time in the world to jump in creative and practice builds all day. I’m an old head (maybe that’s what it is?)

Anyone else out there like me? Struggling to keep up? Has the game sorta passed you by? Sometimes everything clicks. I had a popup game where I carried my buddy after his early death and I just went HAM and it all came together and I was like “THIS WAS WHAT THE GAME ONCE FELT LIKE!!”
But then the rest of the night was back to PC dudes one pumping me after perfectly building around me and editing into my 1v1 lol! ",FortNiteBR

Reintroducing the silenced SMG gave diversity to the gun pool, and honestly I've always loved the gun in general. I feel as if the SMGs are both great in their own ways, and are not over powered, but a complement to a shotgun. I also think shotguns are perfectly done in their current state, which proved tough for Epic to accomplish, but here we finally are. Planes are no longer OP, the vaulting of several additional guns was done so without harming the gameplay my opinion, and the edit update feels very smooth.
People may disagree, and that's fine.
I think is important to share positive feedback and support for when Epic makes the right moves, because they do take reddit into consideration, and shouldn't just be notified by legions of people complaining when they make a move that is wrong for the game.... Like the sword.
Only thing that needs fixes now is my rancid aim.

I’ve done this for the last two seasons. 

Here’s what I think could happen/hope to happen. 

-  a shift in the island. Transformation of some places. 

-  a new way for transportation. Some ways of transportation will be vaulted (travel wise)

- players will talk for the whole community and be really upset when they die and say the game is trash but continuing to play it. 

-there will be a creature introduced
- water world.. flooding?
- additional island or a new venture?
- something vaulted will be 
-   something from old will return. Unexpected. 
- drama in the fortnite community. Real drama. 
-  a few new POI’s
-  tilted will rebuild that damn building just for it to be destroyed
- a beloved POI disappears/destroyed
- tomato and dur war continues with new contenders lines will be drawn
- building will change. 
- new healing methods maybe shield pools
- short videos through out the season(i always hope for a mini series)
- interactive event that brings more life to the game 
- zombies will be back/or other monsters/new monsters
- a new feature people will complain about all season
- a really good skin that a lot people don’t like
- something funny will happen that’s not suppose to be funny 
-  drama with a big streamer. 
- something that has always has happened will be changed. 
- magic added?
- a hero returns 
- setting up major moving parts for season 9
- island shattering event that changes the game midseason. 

**And these are my guesses**

229,McDons45,1548874152,alfy4y,67,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/alfy4y/lets_talk_aim_assist/,1,Lets talk Aim Assist,"Hello there, I am a controller player, and I am here to justify aim assist. 

First I want to describe what aim assist is, because it seems like the VAST majority of people have no idea how aim assist works, and why it is a thing. 

Aim Assist is a feature that makes a console players reticle move slower when it is hovering over an enemy player, and it also helps to ""snap"" onto an enemy's body. There are clips where players reticles are just slightly off of a player, and when  they ADS it will, snap to them, this is aim assist. 

Note: it does NOT have any effect on bloom, which is the important issue when talking aim assist in Fortnite, and something that it seems aim assist haters don't understand. 

The reason aim assist is in the game is because mouse/keyboard has infinitely more movement options, and precision with movement and aim. You can track with your mouse with fantastic precision flicks. I challenge you to watch some of gamings best shooter players aim practice. And just imagine trying that on a controller, where we cannot move nearly as fast, or as precise as you can, take into consideration controllers are not always wired, this makes a huge difference, and remember that controllers have 2 tick-tacs for aim, rather than an entire machine designed for the sole purpose of moving the pointer. 

Now take into consideration how much stronger the hardware is in a PC, and in these new gaming mice. Then think about the hardware powering a console, it is older, slower, clunkier, and has latency issues with inputs, and viewing screens, wether a console player plays on a gaming monitor vs a tv is a MASSIVE MASSIVE difference in a shooter like Fortnite. All of this gives PC players mere milliseconds of advantage. But in a game like this, that is how you win. 

Now, with all of this, and a supposed ""desire"" for a competitive community that is platform agnostic, there will need to be something to help console players keep up with PC, there are just too many advantages to these players, and most importantly, aim assist does not make bullets hit people, it does not ""aimbot"" it DOES NOT EFFECT BLOOM, the advantage aim assist has it with tracking and target acquisition, ""getting someone in your sights"" not bullets hitting them.

Then comes the part that makes me angry. So we rush a squad/or a squad rushes us. Let's say a buddy of mine gets knocked. We continue the fight, then revive him afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do PS4 players play PS4 players? I saw people building shit so fast I couldn't even understand what's going on. There is now way they weren't on keyboard+mouse. Or I'm wrong?
2. What channels should I watch to get the general understanding of building etc?
3. May be a dumb question, but where do I need to drop to learn? Hot places or some quiet ones?
4. How do I even practice building and shooting? And what control settings do I need to pick right away so I would get used to them in process?
5. And a really dumb question, but literally every player I've encountered had some skin. Are they obtainable by playing or you need to pay for each one of them of the battle pass? Because I'd love to have one, they look amazing and are much better that in PUBG. And they fit the game style too.

&amp;#x200B;

The game's fun and I don't understand why people think it's cringy and for kids tbh. It requires a lot of skill to kill someone I think (at least from my perspective of PS4 player).

Epic should include a mechanic for the deagle similar to the reload system they used in gears of war. If you are not familiar with the mechanic I’ll try and explain it the best I can remember. Basically there is a window when you are reloading that if you time it perfectly you gain a perfect reload, by pressing reload and then again when prompted on the screen. I think this mechanic could work well with the deagle by granting one strong bullet in the chamber which would be able to one shot a wood build. Which I believe is more balanced that being able to spam 7 shots which all are able to one shot wood builds. There could be a visual that indicates if you have the bullet that can one shot wood, perhaps a glowing red got barrel, and also perhaps an audio indication if you have successfully performed a perfect reload or not. Through this mechanic skilled players will be rewarded with the one shot mechanic and also it balances the time of being able to spam all 7 shots. Theoretically you could perform one shot and then a perfect reload and then again and again for as long as you wanted, however the gun does not come equipped with the strong perfectly reloaded bullet so you would have to shoot a shot to gain it which could give your position away which I think is a fair enough pay off. Also perhaps there should be a cool down period where if you don’t shoot the perfect reloaded bullet you will eventually lose it. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

*Processing img 187z89zhikd21...*

I was curious and went to week 10 loading screenlocation.You can see that landscape looks different.

On loading screen there is no huge mountain like we have currently.

Behind this big mountain Sun goes down and Moon rises.

Also there is a single,small light coming from the mountain you can see it better during nighttime(user red circle to make it easier to find)

Zoomed it looks like this

*Processing img amwfvtonikd21...*

My theory is leaked Earthquake event might hit not only our island but also break this mountain located NE to pieces.

Maybe someone from The Prisoner people is trying to comunicate with him using Fire Sygnals.

Why would someone want to break this mountain?If The Prisoner has ability to do it or someone else(maybe Earth King) then it would allow Sun to bright longer during the day and melt Ice faster and reveal to us what is hidden under the Iceberg.

What do you think?What are your ideas?",FortNiteBR

Whenever we find a pump, we immediately exchange the guns.

The tac has low damage and very wide spread, which means it has a really bad range.

So all in all: This gun needs a buff.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the heavy shotgun got vaulted, i thought: maybe they should've vaulted the tac and make the heavy shotgun green, blue and purple (like the tac was in the early days), so kinda as a replacement for the tac.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option would be to remove the switch delay of the tactical shot. Its a controversial topic, but pump + smg would still be better than pump + tac, but at least the tac would have a use in fortnite

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively they could just vault the tac and increase the floor drop rate of the pump.",FortNiteBR

Whenever I have the upper hand, I always seem to choke things by just NEVER LANDING THE FINISHING BLOW! I tried to analyse my mistakes and learn from them but as far as I can see, the pretty much the only reason I lose is because of headshots. I once heard someone near me but I couldn't figure out where. He suddenly just rises behind me with a balloon and knocks out all my shield and kills me with a single dual pistol shot before I could even shoot him once. I had a gold scar and purple pump. Whenever I have the high ground, I never know when to shoot. I once thought this guy was going to build up to my level so I tried to shoot him. 1 pump to the head and I'm set back to the lobby. How can I avoid headshots? Whether it's from a sniper or from a pump shotgun, I'm always dying to headshot and I'm seriously sick of it. How do I return the damage they dealt while at the same time preserving my health so I don't die for the next fight?

I hopped on to a Fill playground for some warm up, some little kid was saying he was better than everyone else there. He had a compact SMG and a rocket launcher. He killed me multiple times just by pressing or holding down R2.

I quit, hopped into a duo with my mate and landed at retail. I went into a house, my mate grabbed the Gray AR, after that, there was not a single weapon in that entire house, no grenades or anything, just some bandages. I leave looking for another house to loot and get killed by a player with 150 HP with an AR and a shotgun. This just shows how much of a luck draw this game is.

We hopped into another game, started off good then my mate got downed while I was looting a different place from him. I downed the enemy’s teammate, and his friend came grappling up to me because I was on a hill, I only had 150 HP but they spammed me down to about 90. This guy comes up, misses 2 pump shots while I hit both of mine, 100, and 70 for my two shots. He had 200HP. He whipped out his P90, held down R2 and the aim assist did the rest.

Building is skilless now, every single kid just has their sense at 10 so they can turn and build quick. There’s no skill.

Now im not trying to be negative or anything about it, its just my personal feelings and doesn't change the fact that some people cant enjoy the game for this reason.

Fortnite was fun for me while it lasted, although many people could disagree with me, its ok, lately i've been enjoying other games such as RE2, RDR2 and Dragon ball Fighterz and i dunno maybe because of all this time, how much popularity and how much time you invested into the game (in my case a year) just makes into plain boring experience.

Harsh, but simple. I had this Idea after I made a comment in a post about how we could adopt CS:GO’s take on the tk problem. I really think that its hard to accidentally kill 2 teammates in 24 hrs, and if you do you only have 1 hour to rethink your play style. 

Ive seen many bad posts with not much traction and I hope that this can get enough attention so the devs will consider this. CS:GO is a really competitive game with a lot of people who feel the same way about tking as Fortnite fans. ",FortNiteBR

* The circle is instantly triggered as soon as you get on the bus, so you can see where you'll need to be. It is also 75% of its original size. The storm closes in three minutes
* There is less time between the next circle (maybe 30s less?), so the storm closes in faster than normal
* Higher drop rates for chests, guns, and epic/legendary

I think this would be fun because it would force people to go into the action right away and keep people moving. I also think with higher drop rates it'd make it more likely that more people will find a good gun to fight with right away. It'd be a fast game, and frustrating, but a good challenge and a crazy victory royale for the winning team.

What do you guys think?

This means that every two days you will get a level. The level cap is 70, meaning without the battle pass you would need: 

70 (level) * 10 (battle points per level) = 700 total battle points
700 (battle points) / 5 (daily earning) = 140 days

The season is only 70 days long, so it is impossible to get to level 70 in time. You would need to double your daily earnings to be able to get there. Here comes the battle pass. With the battle pass, you would need :

70 (level) * 10 (battle points per level) = 700 total battle points
700 (battle points) * 10  (daily earning) = 70 days

Fortunately enough, for non-battle pass users, the rewards end around level 40 so there isn't any need to go any higher than that. My concern is for the people who spent money on the battle pass.

 I'm not sure if I'm missing something or it means you have to grind everyday for 2 months to be able to get the Black Knight. Note, this does not include the battle points you get for level milestones (10, 20, 25 etc.)

But in solo the game is getting more and more stale for me even though new content is constantly added, and that's because I see no reason to take many of the new items with me. The silenced SMG is just garbage, and the only time it would be useful is if you want to stealthily take out someone without them being certain where you are, while also being close enough to hit. This doesn't happen often. the smoke grenades block line of sight in a small area, but this is only really useful when trying to run away from someone, and normally staying to fight is better. Slurp juices and small potions are good, but I will never carry one unless I have an empty space or a garbage weapon. I would always rather have a full medkit or normal potion. The boogie bomb seems to have dissapeared since I haven't seen one at all today. And the new silenced pistol, why would you use it? It doesn't kill fast enough at close range without a lucky headshot, it doesn't have the accuracy to be reliable at mid-long range and there is always a better alternative. My class setup is pretty much ALWAYS: an AR, a long range weapon (preferably a sniper but scoped AR or even blue burst can work,) an explosive, a shotgun and a healing item (full medkit if I find one or bandages.) What am I supposed to change in this setup to use ANY of the new items that get introduced. If anyone can give me a good reason why giving an extra slot for solo at least would be a bad idea and not INCREASE how much you want to play the game, then go ahead.

I've been thinking after the debate earlier today about whether season rewards should remain exclusive which I 100% agree they should.

---

I think the Season Store was better in the fact you had to meet a level requirement first before you could buy the items, with the Battle Pass there is an issue with players who have alot of disposable income can just buy tier 70 right away this takes no skill or progression and takes away the value of the items in the pass.

---

A player who worked to get to tier 70 could be seen as someone who just purchased tier 70 as there is no way to differentiate between the two. I propose a change to make it so you can only buy with v-bucks to the tier the same number as your season level, this means you would need to play enough in a season to get to level 70 or complete enough daily/battle pass challenges in order to unlock the Black Knight.

---

This wouldn't affect battle stars either as you'll be climbing up levels faster than tiers. EG: A player who is level 50 but only tier 21 could buy with v-bucks to Tier 50 but no higher til they increase their level.

This change should be made for the next season.",FortNiteBR

▪Difribillator: 1 or 2 charges, very quickly revives downed teammate and brings them back to full health. Would have a lot of strategic value, like the already existing trick of downing an almost dead teammate to pick them up with more health.

IMO adding one slot would not make it less tactical, but rather more tactical and more diverse. If somebody actually plays with the main objective of winning in mind he's gonna get an AR, a shotty, a sniper some healing item and then something else. It's pretty much a meta strategy.

I'd just like to see some lesser used items being used more frequently. If somebody could carry some extra grenades to his ""meta-loadout"", or maybe even use a smg, possibly even carry around 2 or 3 healing items to give himself a defensive advantage, and could still have an AR, something for close range engagements and a sniper to use at longer distances, it would just make the loadouts more diverse.""",FortNiteBR

I envy it greatly as a console player.  One of the biggest things hindering the building process on console is the position of the objects to build.  For example, first is the wall, followed by the base, followed by the stairs and lastly the pyramid.  

In the midst of a battle, 99% of players are going to want to use the stairs and the wall.  The issue is, you have to cycle through the damn floor base to get between them.  You can't currently bind things like on PC, which hinders most people's true capabilities.

My request is to be able to swap the order of these building objects.  I'd love to make the wall first, the stairs second, the base third and then the pyramid.  Is this something that could be made possible?  I can't think of a single person that would object to this on console.

Seriously though guys if your having trouble with team killers spend the extra few minutes using LFG. I use the built in console lfg and require people to be adults with mics.

Joined and there are already 3 guys in the party and first thing they say is we will kick you if your a N***r(censored for the children). Left immediately. If they ask how you are or whats up? Thats a better indication than screenshot your stats or kicked. After you play with enough people that you like add them. I play this game alot and im now up to atleast 2 friends on at any given time. They are full? I play solo or find a nice LFG group while I wait.

Usually there’s only three of us and a random who runs off and does his own thing which usually makes no sense to those of us who have the benefit of talking to each other.  Eventually we made a game of following the random around and keeping him safe. We’ve adapted the rules since then.

Rules:
1. If you have a party of four, pick a president. The first person to die on your next run is the president next round.  If you have a smaller party, either use the random person who joins you or set your game to no fill and run it as is.
2. The rest of you must protect the president at all costs.
3. The president must tour the island, going to the nearest named locations and give speeches. These speeches must consist of a minimum of three emotes/stickers or as long as the president wants.
4.  The president shouldn’t communicate where he wants to go or what he wants to do, but ideally act randomly.  He should also limit himself in terms of weapons and ammo, after all, he has his secret service to protect him. (maybe a pistol or smg with about a clip for protection.  This is more of an optional rule for added challenge.)

I've been playing this game for over 4 months now and, while it has some good elements you can't deny that it it has fundamental flaws.

First of all, the guns are a complete joke.In close range, a pistol will always win against a Assault Rifle, mainly because it has insanely good close Damage.The accuracy is RNG also, so no one can really be skilled at the game, only lucky.There has been countless times when im crouched and still, enemy is moving towards me and the bullets still go left and right without any hitting the enemy.

The matchmake is pretty crap as well.I cant even tell how many times I chose squad mode and the game left me 1 versus squads, not standing a chance against them.

Also, whats up with the new items? Everyone disliked bush camping, two weeks later Epic introduces bush item.They said they worked on a new map location, but instead they give us a silly boogie bomb no one asked for.Not even mention the insane plethora of potions.

I get that this game is so popular mainly because its the only BR game on consoles and its pretty graphics and stale gameplay attracts kids, but come on Epic, do better on gameplay.

Remember when the pump shotgun was basically a 1 hit almost any distance? Shotguns ruled the close-mid range game, and most of the time would deal massive damage up close

Anyways, now I've gotten into some questionable scenarios with shotties ever since the Xmas update. Close range shots only registering for 6 damage, hitting enemies twice with a blue tactical only to get 20s hitmarkers up close, missing shots, etc.

The SMGs IMO are the new Kings of close range.

The lower the rarity, the closer you need to be. 

White SMGs you need to be in pickaxe range, relatively risky

Green you can start to be far enough where if the enemy has a shotgun you can take them down with confidence.

Blues start to get nice, higher accuracy and damage.

Purples are God to me. Seriously, start picking these bad boys up. Fast fire rate, high damage, and  a little more accuracy.  I have melted soooo many guys with blue and purple SMGs


If you have a slot available, it may not be a bad idea to take an SMG into late game.

Here's why:

#1: people drop purple SMGs all the time for whatever else, because they don't think they're any good

#2: you can have soooo much light ammo late game, as people often disregard pistols and SMGs the minute they see anything else. Most of the time you can find an untouched light weapon/ammo spawn lots of places  

#3: they melt walls. seriously, they can take down enemies walls quicker than they can build them. also, plenty of times I've been shooting enemies walls and when the walls are down, I'll register a hit or 2 on them. not doing crazy damage, maybe 20-30 total, and it's usually shields if it's late game, but this HELPS so much. Plinking your enemy from range with an SMG after taking their wall down is such a good feeling, knowing you have that upper hand now and your enemy is already damaged

#4: suppressing fire. similar to taking down walls, if an enemy is behind a tree/rock/wall and ramp and peeking you can get off a lot of shots really quickly, and will likely have your enemy scared to peek. this is more helpful in squads or duos, I'll put 2 or 3 mags into enemies hiding while a teammate changes positions or rushes them.

Anyways, I see alot of people talking smack on the SMGs here but I've come to love them and you should give em a shot too. If I have a green+ SMG the only thing I'll swap it for is the purple tac shotty, which rarely happens ",FortNiteBR

Here's the main things.

When running for the circle with the storm, closing in, you see someone who doesn't spot you. Don't start spraying at them with your AR from a mile away. You're giving away your position and if that person you shot at starts building then you're stuck in a fight in the storm.

Follow them and get in the circle first, try to sneak on them to kill them. 

There's no point shooting someone once or twice with an AR, all you've done is give your position away.


For the end game. Take some risks, if someone has built a fort, yet to sneak into it by building and kill them. Launch pad into forts.

What you don't want is for the circle to shrink on someone's fort and you're stuck hiding in a bush. 

If you see 2 people fighting. Let one win. Then sneak up and kill them while they loot.

If you kill someone and you're looting. Build round the loot to avoid getting sniped.

Never stand still if you're hiding and not in a bush. You risk being sniped.

Never build a fort below a mountain. Someone up high can easily kill you.

Try to get the high ground because then it's over Anakin as you have the high ground

Fortnite (and PUBG -- which I've never played nor care to) are a king of the hill survival genre game. You have one life and you have to make it count. Yes, you need to be able to aim but you also need situational awareness, good ears, and a understanding of ideas like flanking, angle of approach, cover, and knowing when is the right time to attack vs let someone else do it. Now, with that said, anytime a player is out of position, in the open, and caught with their pants down should be it. In the hands of any person who can land a hit, that should be it for that person. That's your penalty for being caught out, out maneuvered, and ambushed. What should NOT happen, is said person spin around 360 dropping instantaneous cover, rising, in seconds, to 3 stories above their attacker. This spam building BS goes completely against the 'core' of these types of games. Basically, don't worry bud, you got played and ambushed but here just spin around in a circle and hit trigger, you're fine. 

Recommendation: Either A) player cannot place a building for 3 seconds after switching to build mode or B) pieces built provide ZERO cover while 'building'. You got caught. You want to put up your walls, fine, but you should be penalized for being reckless.

Second, months ago 'bloom' was all the talk. Every gun was garbage while crawling, walking, running, holding the trigger, or otherwise using it in any way shape or form. Epic corrected this and guns are far more accurate and take into account movement/stance. So, I ask you, if the AR is basically worthless while walking, crouched or otherwise, why are people allowed to bunny hop with a shotgun with seemingly better results? I could make the 'its not realistic' argument, but then again the game has snowball cannons and boogey bombs so thats a moot point. The truth is...its a stupid mechanic that gets abused by people with better controllers or keyboards/mice and the game allows them to get away with it. Jumping and shooting with any gun should ruin your accuracy, period. Further, you never see anyone bhop with anything besides the shotty, which leads me to believe there are some broken mechanics with that weapon specifically that allow this to be useful. Bottom line, 'bunny hopping' should be removed completely as it ruins gun fights and is frustrating and broken on console. It doesnt fit nor have a place in Fortnite, period.

Recommendation: 1) Drastically reduce accuracy with all weapons while jumping and/or 2)  Reduce lateral/horizontal movement exponentially for rapid, repeated jumps to compensate",FortNiteBR

Some tips may not drastically improve your gameplay but they may help you in terms of game sense. Obviously good aim is essential to win games but that's just something you'll get better by playing. Keep in mind tho this is mainly for solo and not the other two modes and most of these tips are easier for PC users. In no particular order:

1. When destroying trees/cars/bricks for mats, always leave them 1 hit. This allows you to nearly farm all its potential resources while also not alerting nearby players of your location.

2. The most efficient way to farm wood is to hit green trees as opposed to the brocolli trees. Brocolli trees have a lot of HP and can grant 50 wood~ but the green trees can grant up to 60 wood while only having 350 hp. (Note the bigger and thicker the green tree looks the more wood it'll give).

3. When building cover, wood is the best as it has the highest starting HP, allowing it to tank more hits.

4. If you're aggressively rushing a base, always build 2 ramps side by side to make it harder for the player to track which ramp you're on and to decrease the chances of falling if you were to use only 1 ramp.

5. If you're rushing when they are in the process of building a base, build with the same materials they are using for their base. It'll mask the sound of your building.

6. I see so many new players make fancy bases that are 4x4 but imo solo towers (1x1 bases) are the best. I usually build 4 storeys high. If they destroy your foundation you can easily build a ramp below yourself to prevent fall damage. Keep in mind that building any higher will result in fall damage so build with caution. I believe bigger bases = more weaknesses to exploit and it's hard to cover all your angles as opposed to 1x1 bases where you know they can only come from 4 sides.

7. If you spot a player coming towards you and they haven't spotted you, sometimes it's better to wait for them to come closer rather than shooting at first sight. Abuse third person, hide by behind a tree and headshot them in the face when they come too close. Shields are limited and taking a fair fight is meaningless. 

8. When building a solo base, place a trap on one of your walls. This can act as a safety net when being rushed and if they decide to jump into your base (not likely if you're vsing a good player but out of 99 players there's always a possibility) the fight will heavily favour you. Also, you could place a roof on yourself and if they do choose to jump onto your base, you can edit out 2 sides of the roof on where they are standing, causing them to fall into your base and getting spiked. TheMyth showcased this on his stream, however I cannot find the clip atm.

9. Many players do not know how to respond to aggression. You MUST maintain the high ground when being pushed. It's so easy to abuse 3rd person to 1 tap a player who has the low ground with a pump shotty. Build up and shoot down the most recent ramps the other player is building. Whoever falls is severely disadvantaged.

10. As mentioned above, if you're pushing aggressively and you have the high ground...don't just jump down and give that up. So many times I've seen players rush me only to jump off their ramp and giving me a free headshot. Keep in mind that when you're jumping down you're essentially in stasis, and if you miss the first shot you're more than likely going to get hit twice before you can shoot your next shot.

11. Abuse double pump shotty. I won't explain how it works, just youtube Daequan's tutorial on it and you'll understand. Pump shotties are objectively better than tacs if you master this mechanic/bug. It may be looked down upon by some in the community but a win is a win.

12. Ever gotten headshotted by a sniper because you're peeking to your left or right, having your sniper aimed at another player? Edit your side walls and make a window in whichever direction the player you're sniping is at to prevent getting sniped from the guy behind/in front of you. 

13. If you're in the zone, don't bother holding meds if you have to choose them over mini shields and big shields. You're most likely able to loot meds from dead bodies.  

14. During late game always look at your map and recognise which areas have mountains. It's in your interest to maintain that mountain asap as there is huge possibility the final circle will be on there and you can gun down any remaining players who were too late to make it there in time.
                           
15. Walking straight from one square tile to another on the map takes about 1min 15 seconds. Doing so diagonally takes about 1min 45 seconds. Plan your loot routes with that in mind.

16. If you hear multiple gunfights near you, don't run away. Get closer, analyse the situation and when the last person is alive, kill him. Better to kill him when he is most likely weakened and healing than to let him heal all the way back up to 200hp potentially. It's optimal to get rid of all the good players out of the game asap as they will most likely destroy you in a fair fight.

17. Jump jump jump. I know it can be tedious but that jump may save you from a headshot. It also helps you mask your footsteps for a second so you could hear another player's. Time your jumps whilst checking your six to maintain momentum when moving.

18. If you're in your solo tower, you can use edit mode on any sides of the walls to make the walls transparent, essentially giving you wall hacks to be able to see any player without the need of peeking out of your base to check your surroundings. 


This is all I can think of at the top of my mind, i'll edit in more if I remember any. Feel free to ask me for clarifications on some tips or even add in your own. Thx for reading.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is a great game for younger kids or older gamers. It’s just competitive, addicting, and fun. 

My biggest discrepancy is that their free to play model is awful . The skins for characters , picks, emotes, gliders, etc are entirely too expensive. 

I cannot justify spending 20$ on 2000 v bucks to get the nutcracker get up. 

20$? Come on epic games. Some little kids might sucker their parents into spending that money but I’m not.

I see 5$ or maybe 7 a little closer to fair. Or bundling stuff similar to warframe so you get more for a large purchase. 

I spend hours playing and get no V bucks. This is unfair. The daily challenges should offer better opportunity for v bucks BUT make them harder ? Not everyone deserves a free hand out. Maybe win a solo, duo or squad for 100 v bucks. Or get top 3 10 times and get 50 v bucks?  MORE CHALLENGES 

All I know is the skins are wayyyyyyy too hard to obtain and I will not spend money on them at the price they are now.

Multiple ways to combat it.

1.When a team killing is reported that person is kicked and locked out for a time period.

2.When a TK is reported and that person has lots of tks, That person is warned then ban.

3.Team killers have amount of tks shown up on their person when in a Match And are stuck with em for the season. ***

4.Ricochet damage is implemented.

5.Tkers get time outs when reported. if a TK took place. Use logs. Minutes too days, (so to not scold friends team killing each other for fun )

6.Making optional duo and squad modes with friendly fire off.  &lt;--- my fave

7.Giving a permanent mode without friendly fire for options.

8.Tking shame bord &lt;-- will never happen..

9.Disable team killers voice chat.

What features would you like to see?,"After getting really into Fortnite, I quickly became obcessed with my statistics. I found a few websites providing stats tracking but I have a few issues with them:

* I can only see my lifetime stats, and not my weekly stats for example, which means that when I get better at the game it has little impact on my lifetime stats while it would be much easier to see on a weekly graph.
* All trackers only fetch stats when someone goes on your tracker page, which means that if you don't check it for a week it will just know the difference in stats between before and after, and thus give you approximative information such as *10 games - 1 win - 19 kills*. That's good but here for example you can't see the stats of that game that you won.
* I like data, I like graphs, and I don't see enough of that on those tracking websites.
* This is more of a personal issue but I don't really like the design of those websites.


So I started working on a basic tracking tool using https://github.com/Jake-Ruston/fortnite to fetch the statistics, and I will start transforming my simple tool into the backend of the future website soon.

Before starting to code this website, **I'd like to know if there are any other suggestions you people might have**. I'm pretty sure I must not be the only stats nerd here. Tell me about features you want, maybe different kinds of graph you would like, maybe you'd like to export your stats in an excel sheet, I don't know, feel free to ask for anything.

If you do that and then get team killed by a squad of 3 people you should not be mad. Like for example me and 2 others were doing Squad and we got some rando on our team. We put waypoints so he would know where to drop and he dropped with us(most just drop by themselves and die). We dropped on Loot Lake and me and my other friend went to the 2 houses by it and my other friend went to the house of Loot Lake and the Rando went with him. My friend found a chest and opened and a legendary assault rifle came out and guess what the rando took it. At this point we invited him to our party so we could tell him to give it to our friend and he doesn’t join and he’s not doing anything. So we kinda just ignore it and say if we need the weapon we can’t just kill him. So the game goes on and we’re doing okay and we get attacked by another team. Me and rando are in one house and the 2 others in the house next 2 it. In my house, only 1 Guy comes in and I down him with my shotgun and I’m bout to kill him. (The rando is upstairs) so he decides to come down and just steal my kill which really gets on my nerves. 2 people attack my other 2 friends and one is downed but they win. So my friend starts reviving my other friend. We are all waiting for my friend to be revived so we can decide who gets what. The rando tho just starts taking everything. He gets an epic Sniper and a Medkit. He also takes the only Shield Pot. After my friend is revived we decide we are gonna kill him. He starts using the Medkit so we surround him and just light him up with bullets. He messaged us some really fucked up shit but that’s on him for going into a Squad solo. Moral of the story is just don’t go in Squad matches solo unless you ok with getting team killed. ",FortNiteBR

So, he inspired me to make this list for him and others on this thread that need some quick tips and not watch a 10 minute video on how to win Solos. I am a pretty above average player with 100+ Solo wins and 200+ Squad wins. So, here’s my list of quick tips to win some games of Fortnite.

* First tip, ALWAYS BUILD. I see so many new and below average players that when I shoot them, they just look around instead of insta-building. Build walls around yourself and then a staircase and figure out what you want to do from there.

* Sometimes the loot out in the open or the supply drop just isn’t worth it. When you’re Top 10 or even Top 25, sometimes grabbing loot isn’t very necessary. If you have a SCAR/Blue AR, a shotgun, and some healing materials, sometimes risking your life for a supply drop isn’t the best decision. Base up.

* When you’re in a close range gunfight, jump and shoot with your shotgun. Don’t just stand there aimed in with a pump. Nine times out of ten the guy with a Tactical Shotgun will just build above or jump around and out maneuver you.

* DON’T POTATO. This means don’t sit in the middle of a field when you’re Top 10 or Top 25 in a bush and camp. Or be a noob and camp in a bathtub for top 10. Then you won’t have loot for the end game. After you kill one person in the open at the end game, you’re bound to just get traded in that small of a circle. Run around cautiously and be on the lookout.

* Last great tip- Land somewhere decent. I understand Pleasant Park and Retail Row and tantalizing to the average player, but the Farms, Houses top right, and the small Salty Springs have tons of loot as well. So, if the bus is ending on Fatal Fields and first close spot is Pleasant Park, most people will jump at Pleasant so when you land at Fatal, you’ll have less people to encounter.

That’s my list of quick tips, if you have any other quick tips for people, add them down below.

Also, Boogie Bomb OP.

* EDIT: Another huge tip is shooting in general. I understand you can just hold down the trigger, but if you want to hit medium to long range shots with ease, just tap the trigger. My cousin just figured out the M16 looking AR can be shot while just holding down the trigger. He always wins long range, but he never won close range because he didn’t know he could hold down the trigger with the gun

* THE SCOPED IS A BEAST. While I understand Blue AR over Blue scoped is an easy choice, if you have room, take both. If you SLOWLY shoot the scoped, it’s an animal. The Blue scoped does 60 HS damage and that isn’t including if its a Crit headshot. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve picked up a random scope in the middle of a field, just abandoned, and gotten 4-5 kills with it because it is so underrated.

* Try out out the Blue and Purple Tactical submachine gun for a couple close-medium range kills and tell me a green or blue shotgun is better. The Blue Tactical sub does 45 HS damage and it shoots with 17 damage per bullet to the body. I actually have been preferring these over green and blue shotguns.",FortNiteBR

I don't mind if some of the items are available on the store, however I strongly dislike how the battle pass is $20 *(USD)* yet contains 2 asymmetrical skins (of 4).


Tier 1: Male (Blue) Knight

Tier 21: Female (Blue) Knight

Tier 56: Female (Purple) Fever

Tier 70: Male (Legendary) Knight


This means if you aren't interested in playing female characters, you have to complete the *whole* battle pass to obtain another male skin. Likewise, you cannot unlock a fever skin for male, just as you cannot unlock a legendary knight skin for female. Furthermore the email promoting the battle pass had extra items not included.


The battle pass is expensive, despite the initial cost they ask either you pay more money or pay with extreme amounts of time. *Side Note:* I know that the dev team of Fortnite is held highly but can we please stop pretending that this pricing model isn't underhanded? Can we stop thinking being titled Free to Play excuses these greedy practices that seek to take advantage of gamers? Can we say it's not ok to price a skin with no special effects at $20 USD? Everyone appears to have blindly accepted this as the way it is now.


**TL;DR** Both the male &amp; female versions of each set in the battle pass should be included, along with the rest of the set items.",FortNiteBR

1. In my opinion the game mode was not fun. You would either end the game heavily favored or heavily unfavorable whether it be 25v6 or vice versa. Seldom did you get a game where people built good forts and had good team fights. Just plain boring IMO

2. It will dilute the other playlists. Adding more modes is a careful process. You don't want to add a mode that will only be played for a month before people go back to the bread and butter. Adding another mode will weaken the other modes UNLESS it is a very well received by the community. I think 50v50 should stay a limited mode and shouldn't be a permanent mode.

[Oppinion based]

1-Newer maps ,more importantly bigger (Must)
 Like:
  -City (the map is fully a city , thinking of maybe New York.[too awesome!])
  -Desert (county)
  -Forest (maybe like Friday the 13th one &gt;:D)

2-Realistic death (Must)
 a-When dieing , having realistic animation like fall down , or cripple will make the gameplay feel more satisfying.
 b-I would prefer too see the dead enemy body for a short period on the floor ,because it adds the feeling of achievement.

3-Ability to laydown (Could)
 TBH , I play so many good games like (Overwatch, CSGO and others) dont have this ability. This ability makes the gameplay feels more tactical and a bit realistic. Having this ability in Fortnite will make the difference between winning and losing. Overall , its not must have , but if we have it it would be dope.

4-Vehicles or Transporter (Could , but Must when there is bigger maps. Hopefully) 
 This is adding up to my first point (bigger maps) , this means that you need more efficient way to transport. I listed vehicles that could work out with the gameplay. BTW , you cant use any weapon while being in the vehicle (transporter) unless being a passenger, but , i think having more than 1 passenger requires more realistic vehicles.
And dont worry , i know we have launch pad.
Unrealistic Vehicles.  
  -Hoverboard that will fit perfectly with Fornite art style
  -Skates works well too
  -Jetpack (with fuel) , could be OP , but if it has limit (fuel) , it would work fine.
  -Bicycle , not sure about this , but thinking of it , having unrealistic bike design could work
  -IDK some wired Things , you know.

Realistic Vehicles (BTW , what i mean by realistic is what you aspected to have when you are fighting for your life.)
[you know, like any other game boring Vehicles] 
  -Cars, Obviously (jeep ,s***ty car, van ,etc) [you know like any other game boring Vehicles]
  -Dirt Bikes
 
5-Adding functioning water terrain (Could/Must)
 -like being able to Swim and Dive
 -Adding Water Based Vehicle (Boats or Jet-ski , or even wired water bicycle like the one i saw at a gallery)
 
6-Weapons (Could/Must)
a-3rd or 4th Weapon of each weapon category. (you know how we have 2 or 3 types[ex. type of shotguns like (tactical shotgun)]of weapons for each category[weapon type, ex.shotguns]).
  -like maybe we get new rifle (aka 47)[palm face].
  -maybe a Deagle
  -1 shot rifle (lower damage than snipers , higher fire rate than snipers) (Must)
b- (the Fun S**t) More Weapons &gt;:D
  -C4 (No words) (Must)
  -Cross bow
  -IDK why Epic Games didnt add these , but Melee Weapons. (ex. sword/ knife/ axe ..etc) [hopefully no pans]
  -flash bang (we dont really need it , we have the best thing in the world (boogie bomb)
  -Minigun (i thought about this , but it could be really unfair , but still a possibility)

7-Second hand items (its a free slot that you can only fit second hand items)
-binoculars
-night vision (maybe)
-xray vision

I forgot 1 important one ;-;

Finally , i am not saying Fortnite have to have all these , all i am doing is giving Epic games ideas of what they could add to the game
Epic games , i know its hard to add some of these and it would take some time , but dont worry , we all have patience (i think). [or maybe you busy doing some super secret S**t. Who knows?]
And Epic Games , you know what , most games these days F***[gain hate] by doing one thing , not listening for the community . Firstly , i am not pointing out , i am just reminding you [if you know] , and Second of all , i dont mean add everything community asks for ,instead, add the most that will fit, and if there is something highly requested but doesn't fit , modify it to fit and add it ;). 
Hopefully this game turn to be one of the best games , because i love it, also because this took me an hour to write and to think off. [sorry if there is a grammar mistake].

The weapons used in a match will be randomly generated at the start of each match.

Edit 2: some idiots are claiming I don’t want the mode in the game. While I don’t enjoy it in its first form, it has potential to become something fun. Due to a lack of explosive weapons, the mode is just kind of boring in my opinion. It’s okay to have a difference of opinion. ",FortNiteBR

It's creating problems such as players walking through doors and popping in long before I can actually see them. And them killing me before shots I fired even register to the server.

Theres problems with sniper shots being fired and the game behaving as if I never fired my shot. And shooting at players that I clearly had landed shots on, and they never took damage from it.

There is a problem with Ping and server tick rate that is causing a very poor experience.

Players very often on my screen are shooting at me and even killing me when they arent even visible on my screen because it takes so long for the server to show that they moved.

Shots not registering, people seemingly teleporting, and other issues that my friends on the East coast with 24ping aren't having at all.

Years ago League of Legends actually moved their server for NA to reduce ping for East coast players and more equalize it around the country. NCSOFT hosts their servers in texas to achieve the same effect as well.

I think Epic needs to adress this and use a tri server system, where players on the west side of the country can connect to an NA West server, and central connects to NA Central, and East connects to NA East. And those in parties that are across the country will always connect to Central to equalize the ping out between players.

Ping for West Coast, especially at 80+ ping constantly, is becoming a super frustrating issue.",FortNiteBR

After losing 2 fights cqc with a shotgun against enemies with rifles, I never missed, I have come to the conclusion shotguns are only good for killing weak enemies past early game. 

The reason is because mid and late game most enemies have 50+ shield where at that point rifles will beat a shotgun unless the shotgun gets headshots. These headshots are not viable as on xbox it is very risky because it is hard to aim with a controller and if you miss you will lose the fight.

2. A steam roller type vehicle was talked about more optmistically than I thought.  Sounds like vehicles are still being debated over at Epic.

The next mode coming out is a silenced mode, which honestly I feel will have the same impact as this one did. It’ll be fun for a few games, but ultimately not be the greatest. Can we get modes like 25v25v25v25 or maybe just a smaller size of a map mode? The original game is fantastic, it’d just be awesome if they could release a mode that is constant action. Maybe a squads mode that has 1/4 of the size of the regular map with 3x the item spawns? Idk just an idea. 50v50 was a great idea, the only problem was the lack of fights when your team is dominating by 15+ people, which seemed to happen almost every game.

The game is literally pure-luck based with absolutely no skill. I could sit here and write a 300 page book on all the problems this game has, that ive never seen or dealt with in any other shooter ive ever played. The consistency in this game is horrible. One game you get 10+ kills, the next 3-4 you end up getting 1 and then die to something that should never have happened. I crouch, I stand 100% still. Some other guy stands 100% still. I put crosshairs directly on chest (minimize chance of anything missing) still even at 1 building tile distance away, every bullet will go left/right unless your lucky. It's pure shit and atrocious. No game in the world uses such a garbage mechanism. In all honesty I also wonder how people even enjoy playing it. My reason? It's one of the few games that actually cross platforms, and that's like the only reason, at all. ",FortNiteBR

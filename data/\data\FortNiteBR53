As a 3rd bonus it has the mobility potential where it‚Äôs basically an infinite impulse grenade you have to reload. I‚Äôm not sure whether these theory‚Äôs are right about it being too strong, but to me with the hitscan of the gun being so good, being able to deal 90 damage instantly with a bodyshot and kind of not being able to be shot afterwards because of the knock-back seems a little too strong.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone loved the mats / +50 health (or shield) as a result of getting a kill which was taken away with the last update...so why not a compromise?

&amp;#x200B;

The whole idea behind knocking someone is that your teammate(s) have a chance at picking you up if they eliminate the enemy. However, 9 times out of 10, if you're knocked the enemy instantly kills you.  aka Epic: ""We feel it has resulted in an unhealthy level of aggressive play, diminishing other viable strategies."" and thus removing siphon. Thirsting was around before the siphon update and still exists ever more so after they removed it. The aggressive and unhealthy level of play is still there.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not just disable being able to kill someone once they're knocked? Someone who is knocked poses no threat to the enemy and imo, it's pointless for them to kill you other than being an ass or seeking payback for you thirsting their teammate. If you're knocked you should have 2 options on dying: Bleed out or, your opponent dies. (Not three which is currently possible-- the third being you get thirsted). These first two options are already implemented in the game so why not just disable being able to be killed while knocked given that it poses no threat?

 Also, by adding back the siphon everyone wins. You still get what you want upon the kill and if you're knocked, you don't have to worry about being thirsted instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: disable the ability to kill someone who is knocked. If knocked the only options are 1) bleed out 2) your teammate(s) die resulting in your instant death. Siphon returns upon kills which does not promote ""unhealthy/aggressive"" game play given someone who is knocked cannot be thirsted as they do not pose a threat.",FortNiteBR

In it's current state I think it's fair to say that the vibe is completely off and it doesn't feel like a competitive environment.  There is WAY to much RNG involved within it and there isn't enough incentive to win games.  Let's address these issues right now.  These are some thing's that I feel should be addressed and potentially changed STRICTLY for competitive game mode's and tournaments.  First and fore most, I think that providing a good player AND viewer experience should be #1 priority.  At the end of the day, when the player's are happy, it's gonna provide a more entertaining viewer experience.  Epic should want these top tier player's facing off with loot that isn't going to be completely 1 sided, we want to see these players facing off with top tier loot.  Maybe not gold pumps for everyone, but definitely not a gold pump for 1 and a gray tac for someone else.  I think there need's to be a COMPLETELY separate loot pool in Competitive.  We need to MINIMIZE RNG.  I get it, RNG is the name of the game, and I still think RNG should be a factor in the game, what I mean when I say minimize it is to change the loot pool.  

Here are my thoughts

Remove Ballers from competitive, BUT make other vehicles 100% spawn rate.

Remove gray tac's 

Remove infantry rifle

Remove Clingers, GL's, and Explosive Arrow

Remove Gray weapons from chests, they don't belong there.

Reduce the amount of chest spawns in certain areas BUT make those chest spawns you keep 100% spawn rate.

Remove either the silence SMG or the compact SMG, don't need both.

Remove the Mini Gun

Remove Pistols

Increase Mat Count - Wood = 700, Brick = 600, Metal = 500.

Either, remove snipers, OR nerf the heavy sniper, it shouldn't 1 shot metal structures, and should only do 125 body DMG.

Reduce damage normal wall traps do, should only do 100 DMG.

Limit amount of splode's or throwable's to 1 stack, shouldn't be able to hold 5 stacks of stinks if desired.

100 % spawn rate on ammo crates

Limit the amount of Launch pads to 2 

Limit Rift to goes to 1

Either ADD AN FOV slider or allow stretched res.

Address end game lag, something I would LOVE to see is the ability to adjust view distance on the fly.  I currently have mine set to Epic but would love to have it on low or medium during hectic end games.  I think without trying to render things in that are a good distance away it might help minimize end game FPS drops and lag.  Just a thought, regardless, end game lag and FPS need's to be addressed.

Now, I'm suggesting removing or addressing so many item's in the game because a lot of these thing's just aren't healthy for a competitive environment.  At the end of the day, we want to see top tier players face off against each other with the best loot possible, we want to see who is actually the best, not who has the best loot.  I feel like, if we limit the weapons to weapons are are ALL viable option's against another top tier player we will see a much more entertaining and healthier/happier competitive environment.  Not to mention, this would SIGNIFICANTLY reduce RNG, which is something that does belong, but shouldn't be such a HUGE impact in a competitive environment.

Address the point's system, there is currently no incentive to play for placement/wins.  Several ways of achieving this, limit the amount of kill points to something reasonable, BUT make sure if you win a game you will get more points than if you drop max kill points, OR kill points don't start until top 50 or so (HD's idea).  Also, in Arena, with each win you're granted 1 bus pass, meaning the next game your bus fare is waived.  Address the tournament system as a whole, the way it works is just not okay IMO.  There should be online qualifiers that are then followed up by LAN qualifiers.  Maybe, instead of limiting the amount of people from each region that make it you could invite the top so many people from each region to a Lan qualifier that will then decide whether or not they make it to the 30 MILLION DOLLAR finals.  There are currently so many flaws within the Fortnite competitive system that it's actually mind boggling that they are hosting the largest prize pool in history.  I think that these thing's are being rushed and some stuff need's to be addressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff in here but I think everything I talked about would for the most part be completely beneficial to Fornite as a whole and the comp scene.  Thank you to anyone who made it through the entire thing, PLEASE remember, these are all thing's that I  feel would help competitive Fortnite make HUGE strides toward a long and healthy life span.  The potential is there, just need some tweaks.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you feel anything should be added or would like to suggest against something I listed please feel free to talk about it, I'm very open minded and not even close to set in my ways.  I just want Fortnite to THRIVE. ",FortNiteBR

This is just for fun. Hopefully you agree with me, and leave some of your ideas for in the comments if you would like :)

Silenced AR: Epic/Legendary to Rare/Epic
Reason: This should happen because I think the SCAR is just better, I'm sorry. It would be better if the Legendary was gone, and it would make more sense.

Thermal Scoped AR: Epic/Legendary to Rare/Epic
Reason: I don't even see Thermals EVER, and when I do see one, I usually throw it out for another sniper or I just don't pick it up. Literally the most forgettable gun in the game, in my opinion. A rarity adjustment for this would help it's case, or just a vault.

Medkit: Uncommon to Rare
Reason: A thing thing that instantly gives you 100 health whenever is Uncommon...? That's odd. I just think it should be rare, because of the effectiveness.

Grenade Launcher: Rare/Epic/Legendary to Rare/Epic
Reason: Like the thermal, I never see the legendary grenade launcher, and I just don't think it deserves that rarity.

Scoped Revolver: Epic/Legendary to Rare/Epic
Reason: A lot of these reasons are the same. This rarity adjustment would just make the efficiency more apparent.

Rocket Launcher: Epic/Legendary to Legendary
Reason: Is there even a point to the epic version anymore?

Spike Traps: Uncommon to Rare
Reason: Again, this rarity adjustment is just to better match there efficiency.

Mounted Turret: Legendary to Epic
Reason: If the Mounted Turret isn't gonna get vaulted anytime soon, then this should probably happen.

Boogie Bombs: Rare to Uncommon
Reason: You get the point. Efficiency stuff.


""OR"" Rarity Adjustments 
(Basically, these are adjustments that I thought of, but I don't know which I prefer. You choose.)

----------------

Clingers: Uncommon to Rare
OR
Dynamite: Uncommon to Rare

Rift-To-Go's: Epic to Legendary
OR
Launchpad: Epic to Legendary
(I honestly think one of these should just be vaulted to. They are practically the same.)

We as a family are staunch anti-vaxxers and believe in faith healing. I asked the school district if our church could pray for Billy's immune system as an alternative. They said no.

One of my wives had a great idea - what if we get a syringe full of water and have it blessed by god to protect Billy? We ran this idea by the superintendent, but our seed could find no purchase.

I finally had to hunker down and make a compromise. Billy has been in sports for his whole childhood, and I just hated the idea that he couldn't play just because of our holy covenant with the lord.

We went to the clinic as a family, many of my girls cheeks were wet with tears. It was very crowded in the waiting room, so I stepped outside for fresh air. I looked to the sky and prayed that my boy would be alright. Then all the sudden the sky grew dark, and I heard thunder off in the distance. The wind picked up and nearly blew my NASCAR cap off my head. I ran inside, knowing that god was telling me to stop the vaccine from happening. 

I was too late. Billy walked out of the office with a cotton ball taped to his arm.

We put billy under supervision for a couple of days and he seemed fine. One night I awoke to the sound of thunder again. It had to be another sign. I put on my slippers and investigated the noise. It wasn't coming from outside... it was coming from Billy's room. I slowly opened the door, and couldn't believe what I saw.

The thunder was gunfire coming from Billy's computer game ""FortNite"". He was screeching with joy, jumping around a pastel fantasy battlefield. I slowly backed away and shut his door. I woke one of my wives up and told her about what I saw. We both prayed and held eachother and sobbed all night.

Billy came home from school early the next day. This surprised me, because it was the first day of rugby practice. I asked him why he was home so early. He informed me the following:

""I don't really feel like it. I found this new show called Rick and Morty, and I think I wanna watch that instead""

I just stood there jaw dropped while he attempted to walk past me. I noticed he had something in his hand. Some kind of bottle. I lightly grabbed him by his arm, just to get his attention. I asked him what was in his hand.

It was a 16oz bottle of Mountain Dew. 

I lost my temper. He knew we only did milk or water in this house. 

Anyhow, he had some friends over that afternoon and they were doing some... interesting things in the living room. These weren't his normal friends from church. What I saw was pretty baffling. They would all stand there in front of the TV and do this strange dance. Their arms were straight, feet planted, and they'd swing their arms and hips side to side.

My eldest daughter told me it was called ""Flossing""

I've been very upset about all of this, and I don't know what to do. I just want my son back. Anybody have any dove approved advice for me? Thanks",FortNiteBR

I've been trying to figure out how it is that people edit with L3 (left analog stick on Xbox One)   I know how to set up custom key binds in settings. My problem is that when I set edit to left stick it is definitely a lot faster... However when trying to do 90's or just run in front of a wall it automatically edits. This stops all of my momentum and just stops me in general. 

In the videos on YouTube they tell you to turn on Sprint By Default and I do just that and nothing changes. I need help because I definitely want to edit faster but this prevents me from doing so. I'm not looking to be able to edit like Mongraal or anything. Just trying to up my speed when editing.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!",FortNiteBR

  Since the first day of my debut to this game, i was achieving to make it playable and scarcely smooth. However, regardless of what i performed since 8.20, nothing permanently worked! i just drive crazy due to having to drown around 20-30 FPS especially at intensely itching grassy spots on the map.

 

  \* i chose the lowest graphics settings 

  \* i reduced Reso through GameUserSettings file. Nullified the grass and the foliage value.

 \*  i disabled the replays

 \*  i verified the game files almost regularly.

 \* i clean up everything constantly.

 \* i added each executable file of the game, chose high performance for each, used max pre render 1 for each, threaded optimization on, chose the dedicated graphics card for each 

 \* i also tried to adjust the Win64ClientShipping\_exe, Win64ClientShipping\_BE exe priority to high at each launch of the game. Applying this actually raised the FPS a tiny bit and made the game slightly playable.

&amp;#x200B;

However, even the last method could not suffice for a long time. i am running wild that no matter what i do, the game runs worse and worse!

&amp;#x200B;

 WOULD YOU EVER OPTIMIZE THIS GAME FOR AWFUL RIGS?

 

edit : trying even much lower reso such as 800\*600 did not fix the sudden FPS drop issues. What the fuck is wrong witht this game?

However, these last 3 seasons have been more fustrating than any other season. I can't really enjoy the game with my friends anymore, they all quit because the players make every fight an insane build battle. 

And then to top it all off, the update that made the game more tolerable has been stripped away from us. I was hoping they'd add the respawn system that Apex has to make the game more fun for my friends who tend to die earlier than a lot of the sweaty players in the game.

Wait up, hold up ***dont spam the downvote button,*** hear me out guys. ***Its really not as op as you think.***  


I basically think that when you are 200HP ***NOT 199HP or 190HP.*** You should able to retain 1hp if get one shot by snipers or maybe shotguns. Its actually crazy how many times i've been jumping up and down and been headshot sniped by snipers. As someone who has gotten many sniper shots, it really does feeling like shooting in the direction of the player and hoping you get lucky. Honestly most of the time the player you are trying to snipe is fighting someone else and when you hit them they are most likely damaged so the **""retain 1hp mechanic""** wouldn't even work. Let me just get straight down to advantages.

# Advantages

* This gives chug jugs more value over the beloved minis and big shields.
* This allows players to get into the habit of snipe, then switch to something else to finish
* It allows players to get into the habit of pressuring players when damaging them
* It allows players that are damaged to be given a second chance to recover from their unlucky situation.
* ***This really does not affect one pumping as most of the time they are damaged anyway from an AR spray,*** **Its unlikely where you just sneak up behind an enemy and blast their face off, considering the skill of most players in s8. Most 1v1's begin with AR sprays. Also most of the time legendary and epic pumps hit 190's for some weird reason unless you are REALLY in their faces.**
* Most players are rarely on full 200hp and thats facts. They would be on 200hp then some random player would just spray them from a mile away and hit them for a quick 25 or something. ***Most of the time this mechanic wouldn't even apply.***
* it makes players more cautious about their hp

# Disadvantages

* a slight nerf for the snipers. ***Its really not as big as you think.*** Most players are rarely on 200hp and ive mentioned like 300 times. The point of a sniper imo is to hit the player which gives you a huge incentive to push and apply pressure, hopefully getting the kill.
* no ***epic 200iq plays?***

While sniper headshots do require skill, there is a quite a huge luck factor in play. So epic please take the time to think about my idea. Its really not as op as you peeps think.

Two of the main ones have been about how the game is penalizing aggression, and encouraging third-partying. Before the Siphon update, Fortnite was a game about risk vs reward. There were two main components of that- regarding your loadout, and regarding strategic decisions. Should you take the minis or the balloons? The minis could come in handy in a fight, but the balloons could help you escape. Should you attack the other player? On one hand, you could get better loot, but on the other hand, they might not have any healing, so you could end up on low health, or even worse, die. On top of that, you could end up getting third-partied by another player while low on health. These components made the game a lot more strategic, forcing players to make decisions that could impact the rest of the match.

However, with the introduction of Siphon, this idea of risk vs reward was distorted, and basically removed. Now, the mobility item was the better decision and healing wasn't a required item. Attacking someone could only help you, unless you died of course. Third-partying was no longer as viable. Though this was fun at the start, as the season progressed, playing aggressively became the only viable playstyle. 

The point of a Battle Royale is to be the last man standing. How you get there is completely up to you. In the first few months, following the release of Fortnite, I would only hide in bushes. While many people ridicule such a playstyle, I got a rush of adrenaline every time someone walked past me, unknowing. Nowadays, I prefer to play a bit stealthier, sneaking around until I have the perfect opportunity.  My point is, there are many ways to play the game. Some people enjoy rushing others, trying to rack up as many eliminations as possible. That is a lot of fun, but the game should not be tailored simply to fit those people. Without the risk vs reward that Siphon removed, the game limits how it can be played. It's similar to the drum gun, without it you were at a disadvantage, similar to how during the Siphon period, if you didn't play aggressively, you were at a disadvantage. 

These are my thoughts on the game and why Siphon was detrimental to the idea of a Battle Royale, and being the last one standing. Thanks for reading.

I believe Ruin is the real fire king, and the reason i believe this is because of the comparison to both the prisoner and Ruin.

the prisoner is most likely a pawn to Ruin, his right hand man, thats why he doesnt show any king like features other than the same symbol on his back.

when you look at ruin, he seems like the perfect candidate for the king role, wearing armour, has a bulky stature just like the ice king, the same type of armour style, and really it would make sense for him to be the fire king.

Before I begin, I know I could move to another game. I totally enjoy Apex and PUBG and Blackout are pretty fun. But I love so much about Fortnite. I love the art style. I love the character designs (...most of them). I love the tone of the weaponry and vehicles. I love the fact that there's a pretty substantially update every week or so. I love the fact that the map is a constantly changing arena. I love how great Epic has done with the Battle Passes. I love (x1,000,000) the live events. 

I also really enjoy the gameplay with respect to the shooting and moving mechanics. But, while I understand that it's a fundamental part of the game, I do not enjoy building. I like that I can throw up some ramps to navigate over mountains. And I'll totally throw up some walls as I retreat. But I don't care to learn 90s. I don't want to hole up and hold position. I want to duck and move around the map. 

All that being said, I'm not good at the game. Nerf building to zero (pls? .../s) and I still won't be great. But it's really really disheartening to roll up into an engagement and suddenly be facing off against the ~~quick googles the tallest building~~ Burj Khalifa.

Also I didn't mind the syphon thing. That seemed like a fun way to force more engagements. This is mostly about the materials and farming changes. And like I said, I realize this is probably not a super popular opinion. I don't expect (or want) them to take out building.

You‚Äôre pretty much forced to carry gliders if you at all like to build/get into build battles. If you get into a build battle with someone who doesn‚Äôt have gliders? Just blow the structure up and let them fall to death while you fly 500 meters into the circle. 

It‚Äôs to a point where you can‚Äôt even get into build battles for this very reason. Aside from a shotgun, AR and heals, it‚Äôs become one of those items that actively gives you an advantage over your opponent and having it/not having it is going to be the difference between life and death. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that third, fourth, fifth, and sixth partying is still awful. We need less mobility, not more. This extra mobility coupled with no shield per kill just means you‚Äôre going to die if you make any noise lol. You‚Äôre being shot at from a dude on a mountain? Run! Oh wait, oh god, oh fuck he has gliders, you can‚Äôt run. 

Keep it in team rumble and turn them off as an item all together. Get rid of it when it comes to the core game modes and arena, build battles are impossible at this point and not even worth it unless you have them. It would be nice to go back to strategic build battles instead of just burning all of your mats to get max height. Less mobility items = less third partying and without a doubt, the glider is the most OP of all the mobility items ",FortNiteBR

Don‚Äôt lock/remove the ability to change your resolution in tournaments/pop-ups, (instead for upcoming tournaments. Have some kind of spectating method without using the players perspective, to get better quality for viewers, sponsors... 
Balance Stretched PC resolution FOV with console FOV, add an FOV slider into the game for those who are not using stretched, or don‚Äôt have the ability to) 

2. Nerf:
Heavy Sniper, (make it so the Heavy Sniper so it atleast doesn‚Äôt 1 shot though builds.)
Granade Lancher (Make the grandelancher explosion damage lower.
Rocket Lancher (Make it so you can‚Äôt use dubble rocket lacher.)
Ballers (Make it so you can either break it super quick or shoot the player inside of the ball, with an % of the damage from the gun.)

3. Add:
Mats (So we can spend more time fighting instead of farming,)and Health Per kill (if not then nerf it to health only, this won‚Äôt make it a quick early game so you can‚Äôt w-key to gain shield, but health for late game kills and squad/duo fights.)
Custom Crosshair, (this has been a request for a long time by the community, content creators and pros.)

4. Point system:
Better Tournament format for Pop-ups, and upcoming tournaments, (don‚Äôt give 1 point per kill (this will make it so it‚Äôs more people end game.))

5. Better quque: 
Improve the Tournament/Pop-up quque, make it so you can‚Äôt be more than 5 min (maximum) to do this you could make it after a sertion amout of time you have to get in a lobby, and if there is no ond in the point range you are in you quque with higher or lower points (depends on the bigger gap between the points.)

The most common reason that people are giving for the stretched res ban is the fact that it's to put 'console on an even playing field', and as a result, has caused multiple streamers, such as Chap, to openly bash on console and talk about how ' no console player except 1 has ever qualified for a tournament'.

As a console player, I agree that we have next to nil chance to qualify for any tournament, but we didn't ask for this change. We would obviously rather have a chance to be able to play stretched or put off shadows or any other settings to benefit us too instead of nerfing pc possibilities. However, I believe that Epic is doing this since modes like arena are cross platform, thereby giving advantages to certain players over others. And tbh, most console players that play arena isn't to qualify for shit, its like the millions of others out there, we just want shield/mats per kill.

My point is, stop hating on console and focusing your anger on us instead of Epic just because they are ignoring the community and ya'll need something to vent your frustrations on.

The increased matt farm is great, but Is not sufficient for the war out there...

Once I get 1000-1500 matts, I prepare myself for the inbound opposition.

During a heated battle amongst 3-5, maybe more, right next to me, I burn through those matts after the fight is over. If I succeed, more enemies land on my castle, or more are incoming from below, and I do not have time to get everyone's matts, especially having to even look for their matts, as more and more enemies seek my deletion. It's only a matter of time before my matter cease to exist against the opposition.

My solutions that I propose amongst the fortnite gods (I also want to make an important note that I saw this 1st solution on someone else's post (don't know their name)):
- 1. Have the matts resupply automatically over time, like in Floor is Lava LTM.
- 2. Allow for a 70-100% matt farm rate increase.
- 3. Grant all players additional matts when the first storm closes.

A combination of 1 &amp; 3 or 1 &amp; 2 would be great. At the very least, 1 or 2, as a new change to the matt gains, would help tremendously.

Now, for RPG's - there is not much of a risk when people just suicide RPG themselves.  They get the advantage of being able to just fly back on high ground, after respawning, or land anywhere they want with their RPG and just repeat again with a suicide RPG.

Really annoying to deal with that. Not much risk, as they just respawn, and they get a high reward from killing 1 to, possibly, 3 kills in one rpg, just to do it over and over.

Right now the only skill gap there is is building however epic do not want the endgame to just be ""build lol"" because of this I believe that they should change the bloom that there is in the game and add spray patterns on the guns. This would add another layer of skill onto the game which will allow better players to be able to aim better. As well as this, it will draw in more professional players from other games such us counter strike as they could already be able to master the spraying however would not be as good when it comes to building I believe this would even out how good each player is and so endgame will not be ""build lol"" as well as this, this will mean that more people would use the AR's and SMG as the could learn the spray and possibly hit most shots if they can aim well. This will spread out the types of guns people use and the meta won't just be build shotgun people or you're dead.

I found myself wondering one day, is it easier to win on NA servers compared to EU?

The question came in mind after watching several NA fortnite streamers, such as ninja, tfue ect. and it seemed to me, that there's a lot more ''new'' players on US servers.

**So that gave me the idea of doing a little research on my own, i made a video on it, you can check it out here** 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRCEwPcf2fE&amp;feature=youtu.be

So i decided that i would play 100 games on EU and 100 games on US and compare the two. I would land in moisty mire for all the games. 

I tried to maintain the same playstyle throughout the games, which was an defensive one.

I had a few criterias to my playstyle.

*1 No fighting outside the zone
*2 Only fight if it's a 1v1
*3 Maintain a lot of materials
*4 Try to get good positioning i.e get highground, or position myself in a way to decrease the likelyhood of me getting pinched between two players

And now to the results!

Total Kills: EU 354 - US 371
Kills/death: EU: 4.91 - US 6.75
Average Placement: EU 12.38 - US 6.38
Wins: EU 29 - US 45

So as you can see i won a lot more games on US side of things. My personal opinion after playing these games, is that US is def' easier to play on, a lot more new players or ''casual'' ones i suppose. There's fewer *GOOD* players per game on US servers, i had to play like 3 games before i bumped into someone good. On EU there's about 1-3 good players PER game. Also it seems that the average US player is worse than the average EU player. I'd say about 50% of the players i fought on US was complete plebberinos, on EU i'd estimate that number to be 10%. 
I'm not saying that good EU players are better than good US, i'm just saying that theres less per game on US

I recorded all the games, so if you dont believe me, i can prove it to you! also streamed the entire thing on twitch.tv/azzinorth

I made an entire new account for the US games, you can check it out on fortnitetracker or W/E you prefer: Twitch_azzinorth

What is your opinion on the EU vs US thing? I'd love to know!",FortNiteBR

Granted, they shouldn't do it like pubg though as they put their patches on the test server for a day and don't do any fixes before pushing it to live.

Put up a test server on Friday or Monday and test your upcoming patch to find any bugs or issues before pushing it live, or even to test changes. A good example is realm royale and them using the test to try changes and fix bugs, etc.

This stadium is assumed to have been built in anticipation of the 2018 World Cup games. While I am a huge advocate for the World Cup, and as much of a football fan as the next lad, we must realize what it's cost us.  

On the very grounds of the new stadium rested [a quiet neighborhood that stood the test of time.](https://i.redd.it/5986y89v3i311.png) What some saw as just ruins of an ancient neighborhood, others saw a true historical landmark. Since around the beginning of the second season, this location has been a first-stop drop for many adventurers. When it was destroyed, many of us were in complete shock and distraught.  In a [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8qg8p7/rip_will_be_forgotten_yes/) created by /u/timmythenice , fellow souls express their sadness:

Although this neighborhood has long since lost it's name to the ages, many nicknames were created, such as: Hogwarts, Castles, Anne Frank, Crack Houses, Ruins, Derelict District, Neglected Neighborhood, Detroit, Junk Jr., Ole Faithful and Ole Reliable.  

Not only did the stadium destroy a historical landmark, but who knows how much of our tax dollars paid for it to be built? And for what?! No one goes there. An eyewitness report from /u/TheReiterEffect_S8 states:  

&gt;""[The place is empty save for a few degenerates vandalizing the walls with graffiti. In all the time I've been there I haven't seen a single soccer game or food item sold. It's just the same group of four kids. One is always dressed in basketball apparel, two wear what look like green and red dinosaur costumes. And then theres the one that clearly drives a motorcycle because they're too cool to take off their helmet??? All sitting around drinking and firing off their guns in the air. The stadium needs to go.](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8qg8p7/rip_will_be_forgotten_yes/e0jwphd/)""

We already had two perfectly fine soccer fields what were regularly used at Pleasant Park, and then an indoor stadium just outside the city. With the addition of this expensive graveyard of a stadium comes new acts of vandalism spread map-wide. Farmer Fred has stated many of his scarecrows were moved in the middle of the night, and make-shift goals were created using the wood from his fence. Many of his crops were destroyed while being trampled upon.  

Frank Mackery from Flush Factory says there are kids kicking around a soccer ball in his parking lot, dinging and denting up many of his workers cars.  

None of this was an issue before the stadium was built. We have a beloved neighborhood destroyed, a giant eyesore of a desolate wasteland marked with graffiti and broken slurp bottles, and juvenile kids leaving soccer balls as their trademark after vandalism. SO what do we want? We'll tell you, Mayor Epic.

After the conclusion of the 2018 World Cup games, we want our historical neighborhood landmark resurrected, but completed renovated. The place was left to rot and was nearly destroyed by lack of upkeep. Walls were crumbling down, roofs were caved in, and the vegetation was becoming wildly overgrown.  We demand that the houses be rebuilt just as they were once before, but fixed to look brand new. No more ""ruins"" or ""crack houses."" We want this to be the **New Neighborhood.** A place we can finally come back to and call home.

Editing walls to see through has been a top strategy of mine (AND MANY OTHERS) since early Season 3. No one complained about this, and now that you cant see through walls, its discouraging smart plays and strategies like these edit ones, for no reason really.

You now cant really see where your editing to. Lets say you just had a massive 1v1 build battle and you now need to get down and move on. If you want to edit a floor down to another piece of this massive structures. You cant see where you'd fall to or where your going. Same thing with walls too and everything.

I feel like the change was unnecessary and now completely threw away a popular strategy that I would use a ton (and many others; Nick Eh 30, In fact I learned it from him) I know not everyones gonna agree and I dont expect everyone to, so go a head and @ me but im kinda mad",FortNiteBR

Or say you're being pinched by 3 ppl in a solo squads and you're trying to figure out the best way to get out of the box. You edit the walls to see which way they're moving or which guns they have out.

First it was the **shotgun nerf**, which in a way I understand not having a 1 shot weapon, but it seemed that a grey tactical was more reliable than a green pump. Then they nerf the amount of **mats** you get and the **lamas**, which seems to be them trying to nerf the build ""meta"". Can you really call it a meta if its a main game mechanic.   


Today they nerfed the shotguns again by giving you **less ammo**. Maybe they hope people wont use shotguns cause they won't get enough ammo I'm not sure but it doesn't make since. They also took out the editing ""**look through**"".   


I understand it's hard to balance a game and of course I have no idea what it's like, but why but 100 mil into a game for competitive play then proceed to take out things that give it a competitive edge just because all the people who don't play enough complain because people can: aim with a shotgun, build better than then, and are overall better at the game.

Then, here's the body of my post. A Scar takes 4-7 shots to kill someone. This is fair. Shotguns on the other hand, can 2 shot people, and 2 shots is all you need when you double pump like a little bitch with no skill. ( Which literally takes 1 second as I'm sure you all know ) 

So here's my suggestion. Make shotguns do a static 50 damage when any pellet hits, only one needs to hit. If a pellet hits the head, it should do 75 damage. ( Let me clarify, if two pellets hit the body, it still only does 50 damage, or if two pellets hit the head, it still only does 75 damage ) This makes it so that shotguns are reliable in combat, and also balances out the shots required to kill. If you hit 3 headshots, you'd kill your enemy. This allows for many different play styles, other than building up to someone and shotgunning them. 

I think this is an amazing solution, and if anyone disagrees I'll gladly argue it out in the comments. I'm also willing to accept that this is absolutely stupid if someone shows me a well written come-back to my post, with points that actually make sense. ",FortNiteBR

I have done all kinds of solutions that are seen online:

\- Reinstall Fortnite game.

\- Drivers newest installed nVIDIA.

\- Commands in the menu of fortnite (additional arguments from the command line) -windowed / -fullscreenwindowed.

\- Recording game deactivated in options of game.

\- GeForce Experience deactivated.

\- Fortnite game always updated.

\- Added DWORD 32 bits in REGEDIT (TdrLevel, value 0).

The PC is not overclocked.

 It did not solve me :-(

  
I have the files, (logs), if you need it, I can send it to yours.

I hope (and need) your help, I would be very grateful.

So my suggestion is that for the first 3-5 seconds of editing, the squares remain clear. After that time is up the squares go opaque. This would allow fast paced edits to not be affected by these changes. To combat someone from just edit/unedit to keep getting the time limit, maybe make it so it only goes clear for those few seconds on the first couple times you edit that piece.

On Fortnite, whenever I set my sensitivity, no matter what number I put it on, let's say 7, it will automatically move to 7.5 and I can't lower it or make it higher until the next number or it will stay on 7.5. This is true for every single number, if i set it to 8, it will automatically move to 8.5 and no matter what i change it to on 8, it will always reset itself back to 8.5.

The season lasts 70 days. If you can‚Äôt hit level 80 in 10 weeks you shouldn‚Äôt get the lights. Yes, people have jobs, families, social lives, school, and sometimes you don‚Äôt want to play after juggling all those things but therein lies the difference. It should be for the people that, after all the shit they have to do, still make time to play the game they enjoy. And, of course, people with nothing better to do. 

Regardless, it‚Äôs a symbol of someone‚Äôs dedication or passion for a hobby. Giving everyone a 100% XP boost kind of belittles the amount of work everyone else has poured into getting to level 80, and responding with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just salty your little lights won‚Äôt be special or unique anymore‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly fair or very constructive. Remember, playing video games is a hobby like anything else, even a job for some, and there shouldn‚Äôt be any shame in taking pride in putting time and effort into something you enjoy.

At the end of the day, everyone will get their XP boost, which is ok with me because I‚Äôll hit 100 sooner and I don‚Äôt really wear omega much anymore, but I just wanted to put things in perspective for anyone that might not understand from a more dedicated player‚Äôs perspective. I feel like everyone else is making their points with a bit of spite and that‚Äôs causing lots of toxicity in threads. 

TL;DR: Reaching level 80 in 10 weeks is doable and everyone who‚Äôs level 80+  already isn‚Äôt exactly wrong to be a bit upset at the XP boost (which has never been done prior to this and is clearly for the purpose of making it easier to hit 80) after all the time and effort they‚Äôve put into something they love.",FortNiteBR

Ok so as you may know i have revealed some information before this one. There are only 12 more days left until season 5 releases. A short trailer will be a UFO flying through space going to Mars, the planet is labelled Mars anyway. That planet is meant to be the new map. The map will be given a name , although this is not confirmed. It has been called Mars in the trailer. OK so on the 30th June there will be an update in which you can launch the big rocket near Snobby Shores. All the skull faced screens will instead say Launch on them. There are two locations where you can launch the rocket. The first place is at the bottom of the rocket and the second, at the the bunker at Wailing Woods, this is where 'The Visitor' is camping out at. The reason you cannot enter this bunker is simply because 1 day before the Season 5 update releases, it will be breakable. In the game code it is currently ""Unbreakable"". It will be breakable by 10,000 damage. Not 100,000 because Epic believes this is way too much for anyone to break into the bunker. Dusty will not be grown back fully and it will NOT be filled with water. It will be covered in trees and grass and the lab in the middle will be demolished.

OK let me tell you about the battle pass. The tier 100 skin will be Davy Jones. This season you will not be able to change color of your character at level 85, although you will be able to change the clothing you are wearing.

The other skins are custom made skins by Epic themselves. There will be an Egyptian based skin to go will the new map.

The new map - There will be pyramids scattered across the map. The map isn't confirmed to be on Mars but it is likely to be. There will be a lot of big ravines and mountains, volcano's and more. Season 6, all i can say is eruption :)",FortNiteBR

I am a fan of winning. I want to win, plain and simple. However, I also subscribe to the belief that there are certain tactics that are ""cheap"" or ""noobish"", though I don't get mad when they are utilized. Personally, I just don't find them as fun and I take enough pride in success that I don't want there to be any excuses.

So my question is this: how do you all feel about these kinds of things. Really the only thing I can think of is camping, but I find that one of my friends in particular will always talk shit about it in a way that basically says, ""anything you do or any kills you get while utilizing these tactics are not genuine and do not count"". For example, it was Me v 10 v 10 or so in the LTM. I got spotted and was probably going to die, so I dipped around the edge of the circle into a nearby barn. They didn't know where I went and I popped out of my cover to get 2 easy shotgun kills, and another sniper kill from cover. When I was happy about getting 6 kills at the end, he complained saying he's ""not willing to be a camper"", basically saying it was cheap and that I didn't play well.


At one point is it cheap/nooby? I don't play by camping and only do it when I know it will generate a kill. ",FortNiteBR

Epic don't forget the forgotten voices.,"1) People need to understand that reaching level 80 to gain the omega lights is meant to be a grind. Hence why level 65 is more achieveable for the full outfit. the 80 lights show players who have have time/made time to dedicate themselves to get the skin.

2) The same people complaining are the ones who want the ghoul trooper back. (Only sought after because it's rare). I work a full time job 9-5 and got omega 80 yesterday after putting in a grind. 

3) I'm not sure if it's the entitlement generation because im 20 but you can't have everything. You have to put time and effort and if you can't tough luck you have the level 65 skins. 

4) This is a rocky road that will never stop e.g if they release progression based skins for wins. I can see it already ""250 wins is too much, epic reduce it to 100"".

TLDR: Level 80 is possible if you put time in. not everyone is meant to have it or it wouldn't be unique/rare. Grow the fuck up and put in a grind.

AR bullets or a Tac Shotty to the body would eliminate shield to the low 10s but having 2 minis, use 1 when in cover to get to the 30s/40s of shield and still have one remaining. If there was more than 60-80 damge its unlikey you would survive even with 100 shield as you would be most likely panicking and you would get pushed hard. My point is although you get 100% efficiency from using the 2 minis and one big to get to 100 shield, for early game you need to conserve items such as shields for future gunfights so the question is would you rather have 175 in the first fight and have approx 110s + 25 in the second and then another 25 potion after the third or less shields but go into the first fight with 200. I know lower shield means damage taken will probably break into your health but in my experience at early game people will carry more meds as they have used up their shields.

This is very anecdotal and mostly theoretical, I'm completely open to be given evidence to show this is stupid but a reminder that it is purely an early game strategy as later on, people will have more loot eg shields/meds etc. I understand there are many variables and I would like it if people could respond with how they would play given the numbers I have provided.",FortNiteBR

It seems a little unfair to the players who are dedicated to the game yet don't have enough time to grind for level 80 for max omega. im sure i'll get to level 100 on the battle pass to GET omega, but i don't want him to look like a wet noodle. i want him to look like the badass he was intended to be.

Even with the double exp weekend im not sure i'll be able to farm enough exp to get omega. it just really sucks. sucks for everyone who wants the skin, and loves the game. but can't get it because of outside situations.

I'm not gonna cry if i don't get omega max. but i will be seriously disappointed.

Can we please lower the amount of exp it takes to get to 80? or just to level up in general? the people who already have omega will probably argue that the skin is for ""The elite"" that have all day to play. but not everyone can grind for 6 hours a day. it's painful.",FortNiteBR

I am one of those who really enjoyed how the editing was before the change. However, I do understand now why this change was made and the reasons behind. I also appreciate Epic Games' response to players petitions and I guess this change was a decision that was made after a long discussion.

That is the reason why I made this post, to suggest new alternatives to both mechanics that could be better than how it is now and how it was before.

I will share my own ideas and I will enjoy reading your own.

1. Making the editings transparent but show an indication to the enemy that the wall is being edited. For example, the wall could shine yellow or something. This is my favorite alternative since it keeps the joy of clear editing and other editing mechanics unrelated to shooting enemies, and at the same time, it stops people from peeking from structures and camping.
2. I read an alternative here [https://es.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8u8c26/how\_about\_instead\_of\_making\_the\_eidted\_squares/](https://es.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8u8c26/how_about_instead_of_making_the_eidted_squares/) that suggests making a timeout before the wall becomes opaque, or some kind of transition. Of course timings should be tested to choose wisely. This idea is great because it allows players to ""fight"" with fast decisions and clever editing, and, at the same time, it stops people from peeking and camping.
3. I also read about blocks being transparent for everyone, not just the one that is editing. I don't really like this idea since I find the others better. Nevertheless, it is not that bad and would enjoy it too.
4. Make the blocks opaque only when there are enemies nearby, or close to that wall. This way one could not exploit the transparency to instakill enemies and camp, but would still be great for building duels.

Please refrain from downvoting without sharing your thoughts, I am sure we can talk nicely and I know people here have a lot of different opinions on how this mechanic should work. ",FortNiteBR

* 100 players drop onto the island, solo mode
* after a few minutes or so a flytrap skin (Shinigami) drops a death note on to the map
* player who finds the death note has to work out the real names of the players in the lobby and write them in the death note
* once a players real name is entered into the death note, they die IRL; therefore dying in-game also
* player with the death note can do the deal for the shinigami eyes which will display enemy players' real name above their heads but this will put them back to half the tier level they had achieved
* player with the death note must feed their flytrap (shinigami) an apple at least once every 5 minutes or they die
* the game always ends with the winner's name being written in the death note by the flytrap (shinigami) and therefore dying IRL

The countless nights I stayed up playing with friends and having fun was truly one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had in a while. No other game has given me the type of adrenaline rush that Fortnite gave. Seeing the Victory Royale animation on the screen was ever so sweet and satisfying. I felt like a kid again, thinking about the game whenever I was away from it. It strengthened my connection with my older brother, who I do not see very often anymore, and my old high school friends, who are now all off at university. 

Unfortuntately however, I most likely will no longer be playing this game, as I feel it just isn't for me anymore. Each update is just pulling me further and further away from what made me love this game so much. Additionally, my brother as well as all my friends, who I've been playing with since November, have all played their last games. They too felt that the game has been just heading too far down in the wrong direction. Now, I know a lot of you are extremely defensive about these new updates, and that's fair, but this is just my/our opinion of the game and we just are no longer into it anymore. 

Regardless, I hope my fellow experienced players continue prosper and evolve with the game. May you find a new meta to completely dominate the bush wookie's out there. To you bush wookies, you will be missed. May you hopefully evolve into the John Wick pro-builders which you wish to one day succumb. To all you little rust lords, may you hold on to what sets you apart from the others. I hope you ensure that every single person you eliminate shamefully takes the L. And to the many new players, enjoy it. Now is a better time than ever to be new to this game.

I've got 8gigs of RAM, an MSI GTX960 and an i7 4770s. My rig runs every other game (BF1, GTAV, F1 2017) smoothly, with no hiccups. Fortnite, tho? Awful.

S4 came with tons of optimizations - players outside your FOV/who are far away/invisible didn't get rendered or weren't as important for the game. Ye it sounded all good and my CPU usage, although it was low before, was even lower! cool cool.

Now comes a fight where you're looking fucking everywhere and the game starts to choke harder than porn models get choked like how the fuck does this happen? I don't know if it's due to the optimizations, but in S2 and S3 I had no issues in fast paced/1v2 battles (Where you have to turn around etc.). My FPS drops from 100 to 50 and in the worst cases it starts to act as a slideshow!

And you wanna know what else is bothering me? That in S3 I could play with shadows on and have no issues going to cities (Tilted Towers, Greasy Groove, what ever), but now, even with shadows disabled, because the FPS became so terrible, going to cities makes my FPS drop like crazy. Doesn't matter if my textures are on medium/high/epic. It constantly drops from 80 to 40 when looking around.

10mins ago I played that new game mode. Ye it was fun until that last 3 minute timer thingie started. There were max. 14people in the last zone and my game couldn't handle it. Went from 80 to 9fps. Game ended, the loading screen took AGES. It took 1min for Windows to open task manager... cause Epic Launcher was using 4600mb of ram and the disk usage was at 100&amp;#37;.

How did this happen over the course of i don't know 3 months?",FortNiteBR

Hi all! Same as last time! We're requiring you to follow the format below (you can copy paste it). Please, please, please follow this format, and check to see if what you are reporting has already been said:

**Is this a playground issue, or a general patch issue:**

**Explanation:**

**Evidence:**

**If replicable, how:**

**Platform:**


By doing this, we can use the upvote system to measure severity/frequency and also provide the developers with more info than simply, ""Hey, this thing is not working, can you fix? Thanks."" While allowing less severe/frequent bugs some more visibility instead of flooding the thread with the same bug. If you wish to report a bug and see that it's already reported, then just reply to that comment. If you have a workaround for that bug, then comment it on that post.",FortNiteBR

I'm not here demanding they fix bugs. Playground mode is here, and it's kinda almost the one thing I've been wishing they'd add since I started playing, but it not that thing. All I want to be able to do is drop into a game where all the rules/settings are normal, except instead of 99 randoms I'm playing with 3 friends. That would be so cool.

Is it too much to ask for? I hear the servers weren't built for small matches or something like that.",FortNiteBR

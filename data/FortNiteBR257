In many early FortniteBR tournaments we have seen that the end game is just a big building mess which couldn't be handled by the servers and thus they reduced the numbers of squads per game.

We can see streamers' bad comments about the game , people here always talking about it too ... Why is Epic still going downhill ?

I started playing like 15 days before season 3 ends , I was trash and always said ""why do people build , face me if you dare"" , until I got the hang of building a ramp and wall as a starter , and I started to see more fun in the game .. It wasn't a game to just shoot like all other fps games .. It was a completely differeny game that attracted us all , we all know that .. We quit alot of games we used to play and came to this game and addicted to it ... What was the reason again ? Oh yea , building !

We all improved at the game , we used to hate double pump because we were trash at it , well most of us lets be real , until we got better now and thinking of double pumping is really relieving instead of this spray thing .. Now we can build , we can quick edit , we think better , but it is just too late because that is not helping anymore most of the times .. Can't place a wall ramp on the ground because it gets melted in seconds ..

Sometimes I kill people who are better than me ( tracking their stats ) just because sometimes I have the high ground and spray their shit until they die , or they were trying to heal but they cant place walls fast enough to stop bullets from coming through ..

I am not sure but I was really happy when I started improving , but all I see now is RNG and and random play game , you never know who will win , a top tier player can die as easily as a noob .. ""Catering to noobs"" is bullshit , sometimes the game is not for you my friend , we all have a game we just can't play because of its core mechanic , deal with it .. but that is not their fault , it is Epic's fault for destroying the core mechanic that attracted almost everyone ..

Wish season 3 came back . I am an aggressive player , I like to build fight , but I am forced to spray people and use splodes because I cant guarantee they are up to a build fight , seriously ...

TLDR : This game is in a really worrying state .. I dont know if Epic realises it , but I hope it doesn't end like Paragon , I really hope ...",FortNiteBR

I agree that it is overpowered right now, but you can't expect from any developer to nerf a weapon literally within hours after its release just because the community asks for it. Maybe they want to test it and see the statistics of it after a week or 2, so they know exactly what to nerf. Just have some patience, please.

I see people panicking on this sub ""nerf it now or fortnite will DIE like Paragon did because Epic didn't listen to us"" or ""Epic is luring the noobs in with easy learning curve so they can make more money before the game is dead"". First of all, I feel like it's very inappropriate to say that Epic Games doesn't listen to the community. I've never seen any developer team that is so much in touch with the community as Epic. The Slurp that went offline merely hours after a discovered glitch is proof of that. Second of all, Epic Games is a business, not a charity, so obviously they want to make money. But they don't want to ""kill off"" their game. No developer wants to do that. 
Much time, effort, love and money goes into making a game, so why would any developer want to have it killed? 

Just giving my two cents here, because I found many posts and comments ridiculously exaggerated.",FortNiteBR
19,ali2k,1532520735,91ra5d,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/91ra5d/i_calculated_wbat_level_you_have_to_be_in_each/,18,I calculated wbat level you have to be in each week to unlock Ragnarock (tier 100) with all challenges completed,"So I calculated what level you must be in order to reach tier 100 and unlock Ragnarock without buying any tiers. Note : the level required is at the start of the week so Ragnarock can still be unlocked throughout that week 

Every 10, the amount of stars for each level is like this;
0-1 2 stars

1-2 2 stars

2-3 2 stars 

3-4 2 stars 

4-5 5 stars

5-6 2 stars

 6-7 2 stars 

7-8 2 stars 

8-9 2 stars

9-10 10 stars 

So that's 31 stars in total for every 10 levels 

Now, daily challenges earn you 5 stars per day. 35 stars per week
Weekly challenges earn you 50 stars per week

Also epic have included free tiers worth 10 stars for every week of challenges completed up to week seven (assuming it's the same as last season.)

So if you do all your weekly challenges and dailys for a certain amount of weeks, this is what level you would have to be corresponding to the amount of weeks of challenges you have done without buying any tiers.

1 week : 85 stars from challenges. Level needed : impossible

2 weeks : 180 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible 

3 weeks : 275 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible

4 weeks : 370 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible 

5 weeks : 465 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible 

6 weeks : 560 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible 

7 weeks : 655 stars from challenges and free tier. Level needed : impossible 

8 weeks : 750 stars from challenges. Level needed : 81

9 weeks : 835 stars from challenges. Level needed : 53

10 weeks : 920 stars from challenges. Level needed : 26


(If you had the battle pass last season, you can still only unlock tier 100 at week 8 but the levels are different and are as such:

Week 8 : level 65

Week 9 : level 37

Week 10 : level 10

From this, I'd assume most people will unlock Ragnarock at the begining of week 8 or 9 but the begining of week 7, without buying tiers, is impossible. Hope this helps

You reap what you sow.","Let me start off by saying that while Epic created this amazing and fun game, they also created a skill ceiling monster. At this point it's increasingly harder for new players to learn the ropes of the game, due to the ridiculous skill gap between them and experienced players. They get destroyed pretty much every game and I can imagine how demoralising it feels. And when you have players like shroud saying things like [this,](https://clips.twitch.tv/DrabImpartialSquidOSkomodo) you know something's up.

So when Epic wanted to add skill-based matchmaking some time ago, this sub went into a frenzy, saying nonsense like ""BR's should be random, it's in their nature"" and because kids wanted to have a chance at running into Ninja ingame, like this is their life goal or something.

So Epic stepped down. And the skill gap kept increasing to the point they're probably seeing a decrease of new player retention and are trying to mitigate that in the worst way possible - dumbing down of the mechanics that make this game unique and fun.

So am I saying we should separate new players from the veterans? I don't know, but I do think we should let Epic at least test it and see how it feels before they go changing core mechanics. This way new players have time to learn in peace and pros actually have a challenge, which might even make streamers more fun to watch.

And for the love of everything holy, stop with these reddit outbursts before Epic even tries something new. 99% of us know sh!t about game development so let them do their thing. If it doesn't work, they can always change it back.",FortNiteBR

Change my mind.,"In any mode, pushing has become laughable, as your building gets sprayed down instantly, and there is now such a massive heirarchy of weapons that the outcome of every fight is predictable. I KNOW, that if I drop next to someone, if they find a  P-90 in their room and I find a silenced pistol, I will lose that fight, because now I can't even outbuild them to compensate for the fact that they have a better weapon. I KNOW that if I see people fighting, if I push the winner with an SMG, I will win that fight, because he can't outbuild my spraying and my few stray bullets that get through his building WILL kill him. 

Also, because now some weapons are just flat out better than others in every regard, the meta will soon fall to just one load-out being dominant, and running anything else would be putting yourself at a disadvantage. 

If I had to guess, I'd say that that load-out is P-90, P-90, P-90, P-90, minis.

There is no longer variety in the game, and no surprising outcomes, with no room for outplaying.

Fortnite was my favourite game during Season 4 I played it all day every day but now whenever I log on I almost instantly want to log off. I loved the cool aspect of building and would practice it to try to get better and towards then end of Season 4 I was getting sorta decent at building. This for me was the golden era of Fortnite just a few weeks ago in the middle of Season 4 when building wasn't being nerfed and when double pump worked.

For me after Epic buffed the SMGs the game took a turn for the worse. ARs are almost useless compared to Silenced SMGs even at mid-range when ARs should shine and just recently the meta has become holding three of the same gun then holding left click. I am starting to lose interest in the game because of these changes, I love shotguns and I love building and with Epic nerfing these aspects of the game to what I feel is a far to great extent the game is just becoming less and less fun to me.

I am just praying that in the coming weeks Epic can nerf the SMGs and buff ARs and Shotguns to even out the playing field in terms of gun choice. The perfect gun balance to me is when almost all guns are useful for different situations and loadouts are merely personal preference rather than a set loadout just being the best and I hope that Epic can get close to this because there are just too many useless or very weak guns in the game at the current point in time.

This is made really obvious when you watch Streamers or YouTubers who are amazing at the game play and when they are constantly using the same guns for every situation it starts to become obvious to me that the game is somewhat unbalanced. 

Guys I would love to have a nice friendly discussion down below about your thought and opinions on this subject. I'm going to be honest I'm not a very skilled player and nor do I claim to be so please do not flame and get mad in the comments saying I only have a 1.2K/D or 30 wins so I can't talk.

First go into 50v50 or playground  when available.

Second is simple make circle motions with your right stick without touching the edge. first going 1 way then the other. Do this until you can make them with your aim going everywhere.

Third step is to introduce jumping and crouching.

Forth step add building so build a ramp jump off it doing a circle before landing.

Last step is to introduce circle aiming while you run to next location in actual game.

So my first idea is to just decrease the damage by 30-40% on all ranges this makes it so that you cant melt people nearly as fast. However epic probably doesn’t want to do this which brings me to my second idea:

Decrease damage by 20% and decrease the ammo clip to 20 by doing thisi have made it so the p90 does 19.2 damage per shot which drastically decreases the dps down to 256 and also makes it so that you can’t just blindly spray on anyone until they die.

idk if i should put discussion or suggestion as the flair on this haha.

I believe this game is 50% skill and 50% luck. Building is a core mechanic in this game and takes time to get used to and the best players are usually masters of building. Even these players can be  screwed by the luck based features in this game for example, a less skilled player and a more experienced player could be in a battle both with pump shotguns, the experienced players started speed building a fortress for the one kill while the noob builds a few stairs but the noob can still come out superior this is the luck feature both could hit headshots and the more experienced player that put all of his sweaty building skill into his fortress gets one shotted by the noob who hit a high damage headshot while the more experienced player got screwed with a 7 damage headshot.

just started playing Fortnite on my PS4 last weekend. It’s quite fun, except I really struggle with the controls and therefor suck pretty much. Playing a shooter with a controller is just way more clunky than with “WASD” and a mouse.


So, everything is fine as long as I avoid combat. But as soon as I engage into a duel I am pretty much lost, no matter which weapons I found so far.


So, if you have seen a guy lately that takes ages to aim, suddelny starts dancing, crouching or grabbing his pickaxe because he pressed the wrong button, or simply shoots his Uzi all over the place, just not into the enemie that is literally just 2 meters in front of him – well, this was probably me.


That’s how I managed to play dozends of matches and achieving one single kill. And this was by beating a guy down with my pickaxe who didn’t seem to know what to do…


So, what can I do? Is there some kind of autoaim that I didn’t find yet? Or is my only chance to keep practicing with the controls and “Git Gud”?",FortNiteBR

Firstly, a bit about me….

* Playing since - Mid Season 3
* Solo Wins - 1/197  - 0.5% Win Ratio
* Duo Wins - 7/292 - 2.4% Win Ratio
* Squad Wins - 119/615 - 19.30% Win Ratio
* K/D - 0.84

As you can see from these stats, I am in no way amazing at this game, and I am carried a lot of the time by my squad. But what Fortnite has made me do is LEARN a new game, and I’ve taken myself from a 0.35 K/D in Season 3, to a 1.37 K/D in Season 5 - steady progress some might say. I have a lot of top 3’s in Solos and Duos, I just can’t see those wins over the line.

The game makes me rage, from day one it’s made me rage and it still does now, I can’t just walk in and dominate like I could on every new CoD over the years, the difference is that I alwats raged at myself, not the game. Even now I can’t get out of the mindset of just trying to out gun people in Fortnite, forgetting the build mechanic exists at times.

The thought of “I’ll just keep shooting” followed by “FFS WHY DIDN’T I BUILD?!” is a daily occurance in my mind. 

The point I’m trying to make is that I’m a distinctly average Fortnite player, and the changes you have made over the last few weeks have started to ruin the game for me, A CASUAL GAMER.

In the early stages I didn’t fully understand the game, even now I don’t, I’m still learning. I can position myself and build a lovely 1x1 in under 3 mins now (show off, I know), but I still suck ass in a build battle. I have no idea where people are, I trap myself in a box, I try to jump somewhere and miss and kill myself...but as I said earlier, I used to only get annoyed at myself, which would result in me thinking about what I did wrong and trying to correct it. 

Now, I get annoyed at the game, and there is nothing I can learn from it coz there is simply no counter to the META you have introduced. If anyone reads this, please think about what you are doing. Whilst there might be a lot of casual gamers who struggle and hate it, I think there are a lot more who struggle and enjoy the learning curve.

Fortnite is different to any other game I have played, and for one reason...building. The part you seem intent on destroying. The counters for it that have been introduced on some levels are great, others are way OTT. I know there have been many other changes, but these ones stick out in my head.

* AOE on Explosives - this was a great move, the AOE damage was needed, but the radius of C4 is insane, has to be reduced
* Llama nerf - Needless idea imo. I hardly see one so it doesn’t affect me tbh.
* Explosive Ammo - Another good move, stops the Explosive Spam at end game.
* Shotgun change - the timer to stop double pump, great, the changes to the damage need to put back to how it was now this has been fixed.
* Builds - Wood starting at lower HP? With a gun new that shreds it?! Core mechanic of the game being lost
* P90 - I mean really? Who’s idea was that? The Damage to structures need to be halved at the least...
* Slurp Change - great idea

Please please please please stop changing to core mechanic of the game to suit new players, make them learn like I had to learn, like we all had to learn, like most of us are still learning. Otherwise, it’s going to turn into another basic boring shooter with no uniqueness to it and it’ll die like all the other games do and something else will take over.

TL;DR - I’m an average casual fortnite player, stop changing things to suit people like me and make us learn the game.",FortNiteBR

I understand that casuals and normies are the people spending the most money, and in a purely business view that makes perfect sense to focus on them, but these people dont care that much about the game and will leave as soon as the hype dies and/or another game is released, your loyal fans on the other hand, might not spend as much money, but will stay because they care about the game.

I was such a noob, but still had fun learning the game by learning how to build. I was not  (still am to an extent) a great player in the game, but for whatever reason  it was fun. 

Learning to build in this game isn’t exactly easy. It takes a while to understand timing, build placement, editing, etc. Especially with all of the current metas coming into the game, players must adjust accordingly because it is an evolving game. 

The only thing I cannot grasp is WHY IN THE WORLD are the developers attempting to severely diminish the MAIN skill gap in the game.

It is honestly the most frustrating thing in the world revolving around this game currently. 

It seems from the recent 5.10 patch notes that building should be viewed as a “build to find weapons, mats, etc.” or “camp your way to Victory Royale (by building a 1x1 with metal)”. 

I understand the game shouldn’t just be in a stagnant state, but adding all these unnecessary features to allow anyone with decent aim to get a win is downright ludicrous. 

I really want to keep playing this game, but I just feel as if the constant updates just keep giving more and more newer players the easy way to a Victory Royale.

I am a relatively new and casual player. I've been trying to start this game since season 3, but I couldn't do that since this fortnite had such a high skill cap. As a person who can not afford to play this game 3+ hours on daily basis, it was really frustrating for me to lose every single game to insane builders or one shot shotguns. Also, this game does not have matchmaking so it means that i am never playing against casual players as me. Every single game was just a bad experience

I finally started playing this game late season 4 period when smgs were buffed. 

Obviously, now devs lowered skill cap. You don't need to have insane aim and pump this shotgun to your opponents face or you will die. You still need to build, but it is easier to counter.   
This is the part where SMG saves new players both in terms of aim and fighting during building battles.

Don't get me wrong, it is not that i don't want to improve in this game. I really try to build and i fell like i am kinda getting better at it. I am telling that before it was impossible to start playing game and feel like you are valuable part of it. 

However, i still feel like SMG accuracy on long range is insane and it makes AR look like a joke.

Again, reddit is often for hardcore players and not casual and i will probably get downvoted. But i just wanted to share an alternative opinion on the current state of the game

Thanks everyone for reading :)  


TLDR: SMG being OP is great for new players both in terms of aim (you don't need to play this ""one-shot-land-or-die-pump-battles"") and in terms of countering really experienced builders who takes fights to really high towers.

This subreddit thinks the P90 is over powered and that shotguns should be back to the annoying 1 shot bullshit but in reality the SMGs are fine. The game is perfectly fine the way the guns are now except maybe the P90 could use few less bullets a clip.

They were then both leveled up to uncommon(green) and rare(blue). The reasons for this were to make the pump seem like more of a viable weapon to those who had not used it beforehand and based weapon choice off of color. Now with delayed pull outs and it's nerfs to make its damage multipliers go down, people look at the heavy and tac as better options. My suggestion would be to fix this by

A: Removing pull out delays

B: Bumping rarities up to rare(blue) and epic (purple)

C: Make the pump a one shot like it was pre- season 4 nerf

Pros: 
Rarities might make shotguns more difficult to find which could help stray off from build meta

Cons: 
Epic would probably make tacs, green, blue and purple, simply just to make the players choose over preference rather than color

Now let me just say a few things here that could be adjusted to stop turtling that WOULDNT change the meta of the game. 

• Removing the ability to see through walls at all. Even damaged walls. 
- Harder to see for those turtling. Incen

• Dampen Outside sounds when inside of a sealed building (1x1). 
- Harder to hear for those turtling, making it less rewarding. 

• Increase drop rate of stink bombs + reduce rarity. 
- Less destruction of building but still high CC amounts. 


• Remove or nerf Turbo Building. 
- Disallows players from holding mouse 1 to protect themselves. A more skillful approach is having to click to place walls/floors. Currently turbo building is 20 CPS. Old turbo was 4.5 CPS. Clicking is faster. Turbo building technically isn't even required to be good at building or do anything. Clicking is very simple.

I really love playing fortnite, I've been playing it since season 1, but I'm afraid that I might not be able to play the game once Epic Games decided to release a specific skin.  


I have a coulrophobia a.k.a. phobia of clowns, I developed it when I was in grade school, had a traumatic experience back then and ever since, whenever I see a clown, I instantly froze and gets chills and basically become broken. As of the moment Epic doesn't have any clown skin in the game, but I'm afraid that they might add it in the game in the future, battle royale is really not the type of the game for my phobia, 90+ enemies will appear out of nowhere, and knowing that someone might have the clown skin, I'm 100% sure I can't play the game even just by knowing it, I don't have to play the game to test if I'll be scared, I KNOW I'LL BE SCARED.  


If the game design or marketing already decided to add it, that's okay, I don't want Epic Games to lose profit, but I'm suggesting to add a special option for those? like, maybe just set the texture of a player to solid black(kind like an unlockable character) from the player's account?

  
I'm thinking having an additional ""block skin"" option in the setting, then a dropdown of the skin names to block a specific skin? then the player will only see the solid black texture when other player is equipped with the blocked skin. That way not only my phobia will be resolved, but also other's phobia like shark, dinosaurs(not sure if this exist tho), etc :)

I played fortnite instead of PUBG is because it was different. Building, playstyles, a huge variety of useful items.

I started mid season 3. It was perfect imo.

Season 4 the double pumping is there, but it took SKILL. You had to aim to hit both shots, even if you missed one  there's an another pump and you still have chance to win.

Season 5 just fucked it up really.

You can ONLY use 1 shotgun.

They said damage is not random that they've fixed it on the patch notes of 5.0 and now you see your pellets, how many have hit.

It didn't fix the shotguns. People still getting 7,14,8 damage with mass pellets hit

Buff suppressed smg? Okay, good way to give it more use.

Add a more accurate SMG with same damage as the unaccurate LMG  and more drop rate(its uncommon and rare) This is not fun.

Vault tac smg and add a new one? Okay, seems fair enough

Add a fucking spray and pray 50 bullets accurate piece of shit and make sure it has 40+ dmg per ONE headshot. Fuck off

Conclusion 

Epic straight up removed the only original thing from their game, building

Adding new broken smg, giving other smgs a buff, harder to get materials, and nerf ghost peeking that was the counter to mid-long range sprayers.

The game is very very noob friendly which is not want people want. 

I played since season 3 and i can build pretty fast, and a lot of my friends and other people too.

But it's useless with people carrying smgs and explosives

ARs are kind of useless rn because you gave smgs accuracy which Is the opposite of what they are meant for, close range combat. People drop ARs for drum gun for its amazing accuracy mid range.

Epic listened to whiny ass kids that didn't know how to react on time, aim or build. Those who complained about 2pump in season4 should be sent to jail really.

So yeah, I have a bunch of stupid questions but I can't seem to find the answers anywhere on the internet. Everytime I google my questions, the only thing that shows up are stupid 10 minutes-long Fortnite videos which don't even answer my questions.

1. **Do you guys have a Discord server?** I only found expired links with my google search, and I don't see any in the sidebar or the sticked megathread.
2. **To get the Road Trip secret prize, do I need to complete all quests for every week in this season?** I only did the free quests of Week 1, and I missed Week 2 completely because I have an important test on friday so I stopped playing for the last 10 days to focus. Did I lose my chace to earn the secret prize?
3. **Is there a way to check my account level on Epic's website or something?** On Switch you can't see your profile, and as far as I'm aware, my account level is the total levels I've earned through season 4 and 5. I'm curious where I'm at.
4. I think I left the game on tier 13 before my hiatus to study. **Do you think I can reach tier 100 before season 6?** I really want to get everything out of my $10.

199,jgmonXIII,1532501297,91phst,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/91phst/this_game_has_burned_out/,1,This game has burned out.,"I burned out halfway through season 4. I’ve played since the day the game released.

Taking a really hard look at the game, it really doesn’t do anything special. I mean look at the gun selection. Most of them are guns that were made popular by COD during their peak. Shout out the scar, m16, the p90, mp5, and the L96a1. (not saying only cod can have these guns, it’s just weird that the game has all these weapons.) What made the game fun for me was just the fact that i could play with friends. But there was never a single session with them where we didn’t say this game is bullshit. That’s obviously an exaggeration but we’ve never considered the game more than just ok, and here’s why.

The shooting mechanics.
People have complained about bloom since day 1 and it’s still in the game. I just don’t get how anyone can stand it. 

Animations. 
Just look at the animation for pulling out the pump. Also why don’t the characters ever hold objects in their hands. It looks dumb when they just put a hand in their face to gain shields, or how they just spin an arm around another arm. At least add actual bandages. Then there’s the expressionless characters. Make them flinch or something. 

All the bugs.
I get the game is “early access” but sometimes i wonder if epic actually play tests their game lol. Like in the beginning of season 3 when our weapons would disappear. How do you not see that? Or recently the shooting carts or how we couldn’t unequip items. 

The one thing that this game did right is battle pass but even then it needs work. The next isn’t really the games fault but

The Community.
I feel like the end of season 2 is when the game became casual. All these people who come on to public matches and sweat their ass off bc they saw their favorite streamer do it. I could no longer get on and just sit back and enjoy because every fight on ps4 there’s somebody trying to build an entire city. 
Then there’s the people who just praise epic for doing the bare minimum. I remember when a post made it to the front page bc epic put text on a skin. I couldn’t believe it. Everyone saying that epic puts so much attention to detail, when there’s better games out there with more passion put into them.

I also don’t see the game really changing for the better. It’s too big now. Anything epic does now will piss at least half the community off. I had my fun with the game but i honestly think it’s done. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite adds an extra dimension by adding destructible environments and building of structures - Awesome! Should you feel forced to use it because it is the only viable option of winning? - Ofcourse not! That would make for a stale game with only one play style.

I play Fortnite because of the style, smooth feel and the attention that it gets from its developers, NOT because you can build a fort.  I can bet you that I am not the only person with this opinion.

So, the big question. How much is a single v buck worth? 

(NOTE: This will be in US currency, if you want to know how much v buck is in your currency, just convert it with a converter).

So since I know a little bit of maths, I decided to take it upon myself to figure out how much 1 single v buck is worth.

Now, first we need to figure out the amounts you can buy. 

You can buy 500 for 4.99, you can buy 1000 for 9.99, you can buy 2,500 for 24.99, you can buy 6,000 for 59.99, and you can buy 10,000 for 99.99.

So what we first do is round the costs. Round 4.99 to 5, 9.99 to 10, etc. So now the prices are 5$, 10$, 25$, 60$, And 100$.

Now we decide how to do this. Let’s try a simple formula. Cost divided by V buck. Let’s try it with the first amount you can buy. (NOTE: This excludes the bonuses you get).

So if I pay 10$ for 1000 V bucks that means that we buy each v buck for 0.01 dollars, or 1 cent per v buck. Is this true? Well, we gotta test it.

5 divided by 500 is 0.01
10 divided by 1,000 is 0.01
25 divided by 2,500 is 0.01
60 divided by 6,000 is 0.01
And 100 divided by 10,000 is 0.01

Now let’s make sure this is correct!

0.01 X 500 is 5
0.01 X 1,000 is 10
0.01 X 2,500 is 25.
0.01 X 6,000 is 60.
0.01 X 10,000 is 100.

So it’s confirmed! One c buck is worth 1 cent. I figured it out by dividing the cost by v buck, and I got 0.01 dollars or 1 cent. Now to confirm this, I reversed the formula. V buck worth (1 cent) times v buck amount, gave me the cost you pay for. 

SO in conclusion, one singular v buck is worth ONE CENT. 

Now how much is a skin worth? I’m not calculating that. I think I gave all of you all enough info that you can calculate it on your own. You’re welcome!

Was I correct? Tell me in the comments. I think I did okay.

TLDR: One v buck is worth 1 cent in American currency (USD). You can convert into any other currency if you want.",FortNiteBR

I’ve been here from the beginning (pre-season) and seen all the meta’s. So don’t go commenting “Oh, well you’re just a noob who sprays so your opinions don’t matter” I realise this will be hard to digest for some people on this sub reddit, I mean look at the new section ffs.

To start let’s flash back to season 3 and 4. There were lots of posts saying that getting one pumped was unfair and that all battles just boil down into a shotgun jump war, and that you guys wanted epic to make more weapons viable in close-quarters combat. And that what you’ve got. So adapt to it. SMGs are now a dominating close range weapon, so start using them like that.

I’m also seeing a lot of post about explosives dominating end game. That’s true, they did because they make short work of building and give you shot at the enemy, however with the new P90 now that rips apart cover, explosives will probably be seen less end game.

However, Epic, we need to talk about building nerf. If you want to add a gun which shreds through builds, you can’t go nerfing the health of builds at the same time. Honestly I would love a meta we’re building is still a strong tactic which widens the skill gap a bit, but you don’t have to get lucky with a shotgun headshot to win the fight, and SMGs are good for close range to.

The point is, you guys asked for this. Stop crying. Please. Epic have seen the first hundred posts. No need for anymore. It will all change on a few weeks anyway.

I’m ready to get down voted to an oblivion because all the 12 year old “OGs” got killed by the new gun.

IMO if you build more than 5 tiles high in a fight you probably suck, and you're only building because you're not good at gun play, and the people who spam shoot structures suck at building.

I consider myself an okay/mid-tier player (S4/S5: 3-4 K/D, PC: bottomhausvirgin for reference).  Mostly unrelated, but I enjoy Fortnite for the social aspect of Squads, a game mode that's become less enjoyable due to the SMG/splodes meta shift. I've definitely started to lose interest in this game and become increasingly frustrated with the current state of the game and this post explains my thoughts.

**Effect of early Season 5 changes:**

1. Success now strongly influenced by RNG: Looting  SMG/Splodes, hoping bloom is in your favor
2. Building nerf to limit opportunities for outplay

End of season 4 was a great place for Fortnite. A variety of loadsout were still viable. ARs and shotguns were still an option, SMGs were still strong (hence Tac SMG nerf). Now ARs and shotguns are obsolete. SMG weapon class has become so versatile that it can be used for CQB, building clearance, and mid-long range pickoffs.

**My guess at Epic's motives**

1. Cater to large low-skill player base by reducing the skill gap and skill cap.
2. Make competitive scene (pros vs pros, not pubstomp contest) more exciting by discouraging turtling

Dividing the player base into low-skill/mid-tier/pro players, these changes hurt the mid-tier players the most, and I will rationalize this by giving my impressions on how these changes have affected these portions of the player base.

**For low-skill players**

I think it's fair to generalize that these are the youngest players. This is also the largest constituent of the player base. These players mostly have lots of time and energy on their hands. While Epic may think that it is a wise decision to cater to these players, I argue that catering to these players has no effect on their interest in the game. *These are the players who play the game for the enjoyment of video games and for the hype of Fortnite. They are not invested in the metagame and will continue to play regardless of how a patch may cater to them or may further increase the skill gap*.

By promoting ""inclusiveness"" Epic makes cancerous changes. With changes like these, low-skill players may see an increase in performance, without actually improving their gameplay. Without getting too philosophical, this sort of instant gratification is a plague on society and caters to our inner dopamine fiend. Changes like this are unhealthy because they teach (1) you don't have to invest to improve yourself because (2) the system will shift in your favor.

What ever happened to ""hard work pays off"". We've become so far removed from delayed gratification and being rewarded through hard work. This patch is the participation trophy of Fortnite.

**For mid-tier players**

This is the demographic I consider myself to be a part of. Due to past gaming experiences, I have good aiming mechanics and am a quick learner to pick up on new gameplay concepts such as building. In Fortnite, us mid-tier players understand that we're not the best in the game and that we'll still take our L's against players who are definitively worse than we are, but we know that we can elevate our gameplay by developing our core gameplay skills (building) and becoming better at decision-making.

Season 5 frustrates us because it's increasingly more difficult to separate ourselves from the bottom of the barrel when the meta favors RNG. There is now a reduced effect of improving our core gameplay mechanics because of this shift towards RNG. It's also difficult to improve our game-time decision making because there are so few ways to outplay the spam metagame. Even when you watch pro-level players, they have hard time adapting to the new meta in *solos* (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/91krci/06\_kd\_player\_with\_p90\_vs\_top\_tier\_pro\_player/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/91krci/06_kd_player_with_p90_vs_top_tier_pro_player/))

It's frustrating to see that our efforts in elevating our gameplay can be smacked down with this sort of shift in the metagame to appeal towards lower-skill players. It also frustrates us to hit this wall in improvement beyond ""beginner gains"" and I for one, have begun to lose interest. We are still a significant part of the player base, and to use a metaphor, we are the ""swing states"" in US presidential elections.

**For pro-level players:**

While it is a fact that many pro players dislike this shift in the metagame and have also found it difficult to counterplay in the new metagame, these players have solid Fortnite IQs which helps them establish early game superiority which puts them in strong positions to close out the game, despite having an increased chance in being knocked out by worse players.

However, most of these pro-level players are also content creators or contributors and I don't see them leaving the game anytime soon.

**Possible solutions:**

Some solutions I've seen from various sources.

1. SMG nerf across the board, whether its accuracy, damage, damage against buildings. I think we can all agree this is a must.
2. If gunplay is the new focus on Fortnite, then replace bloom with recoil patterns.
3. Make shotguns viable again. With how much building has been nerfed and how much SMGs have been buffed, even if pumps could deal 200+ damage AND double-shotgun was restored AND pump switch delay was removed, shotguns would still be less effective than SMGs currently.
4. Make building effective again. Building was a core mechanic and allowed so many opportunities for outplay. The nerf to health and the buff to SMGs/splodes took that away. This was effectively a double-nerf
5. Introduce a competitive/LTM playlist to test these experimental changes and their effects on competitive gameplay rather than test against the entire player base.

**TL;DR excluding solutions:**

Due to the hype of Fortnite, I consider the extremes (skill-level wise) of the player base to be static in the sense that these players will continue to play regardless of the shifts in the metagame. However, a still significant part of the player base (mid-tier players) will lose interest and discontinue playing because it is (1) more difficult for us to outperform low-skill players due to shift towards RNG and (2) it is more difficult to improve our gameplay when there are so few viable playstyles and limited opportunities for outplay.

I want to discuss what everyone’s thoughts are on the smg meta?

With all these overpowered smg’s in the game, this game is very hard to play right now. I used to love getting on this game and being able to play and enjoy it for 2-4 hours. Now I can hardly play for an hour. The current state of the game is trash. 

Fortnite’s main quote about this game back when it came out was, “the battle is building.” At the moment it is very hard to build anything because you run out of mats due to the recent nerfs on the amount of mats you get or a structures health. I destroyed the bottom of a wooden 1x1 today with one magazine from a regular blue smg. Before the most recent patch it would’ve taken 2-3 magazines. 

Another problem with the smg meta is that it requires 0% skill. A battle royale game requires a lot of skill and strategy and right now fortnite br isn’t looking too well in these two categories. The smg is spray and pray and you can’t counter it other than taking out your own smg and start to spray as well. If epic wants this smg meta to stay in the game then they need to bring back one pumps to the face that do 200+ damage or the season 1-2 double pump. They also should buff building and make this game what it was originally supposed to be. 

I think almost everyone has an smg in their inventory if they have the opportunity to do so because it is just too overpowered. People used to say, “just build lol” but my friend made me realize that now it’s, “just spray lol”. Something has gotta be fixed and the p90 needs to be nerfed or removed because the blue smg’s basically already qualify as epic and legendary weapons. ",FortNiteBR

I am not down to communicate with someone who says “just build”, “you’re just bad”, or “you need to adapt”. These are not valid arguments. These are just low effort ad hominems that help absolutely nothing. Everyone on this subreddit I assume has the desire to make this game better for everyone. Regardless if you are a builder oriented player or one who relies more on weapons, I think we can all admit that the collection of weapons that Fortnite currently has is extremely broken. No, I am not just saying that the compact smg is overpowered, I am relating to the entire hierarchy of weapons. 

This is anecdotal, and I understand that there might be a small portion of you guys that deliberately pick up the minigun or LMG, but generally, these are guns that you only use at the start of the game because they are in your proximity. Now, the new material mutilating guns like the drum gun or the compact smg replace the intended role of the minigun and the LMG guns and perform well in even more situations.  

When the 2.4.0 patch was introduced in late January, the minigun was added to the game. Anytime a gun is added to Fortnite, the developers always include a succinct description of the weapon and what make it distinct from everything else, which was “Control the battlefield with sheer firepower with this new addition to Battle Royale.” In my mind, the initial intention of the minigun that the developers had was to introduce a weapon that would lack the advantage in player versus player firepower (in regards to poor mobility and delayed triggering) but would excel in taking down player made structures (which most likely reflects the “control the battlefield” phrase as it allows you to fire consecutively for a long amount of time, with the expense of poor accuracy). Even though the community was not as large during this time period, the amount of discussion relating to it being overpowered was relatively low. Overall, it was a great weapon to add in terms of balancing. It offered only a situational advantage and had pluses and drawbacks that neutralized each other fairly well. Even though it had no magazine and could be fired for an extremely long time, it didn’t nullify building. Anyone skilled enough at building or just at the game in general could easily outplay someone with a minigun. 

Then, in late April, version 3.5 was introduced which brought the LMG to Fortnite. The LMG’s functionality is similar to the minigun, however, its magazine is capped at 100 rounds, it takes very long to reload, but its mobility and power are notably higher. With the introduction of the LMG, I felt as if the usage of the minigun severely dropped. You essentially get a minigun that exceeds in both taking down materials and players, just with a lower magazine. With the minigun, by the time you had enough rounds to continuously shoot with it past 100 rounds, most low skill players will have been eliminated and every player will have enough mats to effectively counter that. The LMG would spawn with 100 rounds that could mow down materials and players at a close range without a delay. In my opinion, it could’ve been overpowered but its awful accuracy and slightly bad mobility made it because another fitting piece of the puzzle in the game. 

Now, the drum gun has essentially overtaken the role of the minigun, the LMG, SMGs, and moderately ARs. It is why you typically see streamers leave SCARs on the ground and keep a blue drum gun. With very slight adaptations in playing style, you can enjoy the mid-range accuracy of ARs, spraying hipfire in close combat, and resistance towards other players building from you or above you. It has overall ruined the variation of weapons in the game. And now that double shotgunning has been hindered, many players carry the drum gun with a shotgun as opposed to an AR, an SMG, and a shotgun. While the accuracy of the drum gun might not be the best, neither are ARs due to the RNG applied to them. After considering the botched advantages and hindrances that this game offers, it is easier and usually better to carry the drum gun instead of an AR, an SMG, and an LMG or minigun. 

The compact smg is obviously better than any previously mentioned weapon due to his fire rate, magazine, and resistance towards player building. But look at the advantages of that weapon, why the hell would you carry an LMG, a minigun, or an AR when you just have the compact smg? From a long distance range the compact smg will be just as viable as any AR due to the RNG applied to bullet paths (as known as bloom), so it essentially blows any weapon out of the water.

Why are SMGs so good now? Why are materials being nerfed? Why is Epic Games ruining the one factor of their game that made it original and special from everyone else’s? Have they not seen what the hell happened to other games when they repeatedly added broken updates that the majority of the community hated? Closing the skill gap will only instantly gratify the younger, less dedicated playerbase that will vanish when the next “big thing” comes out. The dedicated, skillful playerbase that usually sticks with games for longer durations of time will have moved to something else due to the poor management of Fortnite. Fortnite is going down the exact same path that H1Z1 went down. It is quite sad. 

Also, off topic, keep c4 disabled forever. Why in the hell can you carry 10 of those potent things?

This issue has now come to a head in this latest patch where building has yet again been nerfed and a new “op” smg has been added.

Now I’m as against this meta as anyone, but I do not believe nerfing smgs, tommy guns, or miniguns is the answer.  Let me repeat, these guns do not need nerfs (splodes should be reverted back to how they were originally but that’s a different story).  Nerfing smgs now will only lead to the dumbing down of the game, let’s not have a repeat of Destiny again.  What needs to happen is some major buffs to shotguns and a return to former glory for building.  That way these new “spammy” weapons remain powerful for those who like them, however good players can counter them with building and powerful shotguns.

The buffs specifically that need to happen for shotguns are:
-Removal/drastic decrease in the ready and stow times especially for the pump to allow for quick shots while building and editing
-A rebuff to damage on the pump and tac shotties, revert the damage nerfs from a few patches ago and allow pumps to 1 shot again. 
-The fix they have to prevent double shotguns right now is perfect.  It should stay in the game to enhance weapon variety and will not be a problem if shotguns are buffed like I have said.  

Building buffs:
-Revert nerf from this patch 
-Remove editing nerf to allow for clean edit plays in high level build fights
-Reinstate damage dropoff to bullets hitting player built structures
-Nerf to splodes will buff building

TLDR:/  To promote both a healthy skill gap and a variety of different playstyles the best course of action is to make multiple weapons and strategies powerful/viable rather than dumbing everything down.  That is the idea of this post because in the end I want a game that I can have fun in and be rewarded for my skill, currently fortnite is neither of these.

When Fortnite first started blowing up around the world (Around March 2018) my classmates have blown up. I've never really cared for Fortnite except I would casually play after school for 30 minutes and then likely go play another game.

I one day played with real life friend. I had a decent match even though I still sort of sucked. The next day I go to school and I'm being harassed. Why? Because of my skin. I was a default skin (and always was). I told them I'm not buying cosmetics so I can be ""cool"". Barrage of hate continued. It got to the point where I was getting in fights over it. I still refused to buy the battle pass/skins. This stopped after the SRO got involved in the situation and put it to a stop.

Starting 3 months ago, I'd get threatening DMs on my Xbox account when I killed a player who had skins. Then YouTubers such as Ceeday popped up and proceeded to bash default skins even more, causing his young fanbase to attack them even more. Now I'm being recommended to follow Instagram accounts such as ""defaultskinlivesmatter"". I just ignored these and moved on.

Now, today, I'm watching my casual YouTube content about to leave on vacation and one video by YouTuber ""Fe4RLess"" pops up in the recommended videos. The title of the video? ""Bullying default skins on Fortnite ...lol"". This video pushed me to my breaking point. It's literally this guy making fun of default skins because apparently they're all bad.

I'm done with Fortnite. I have uninstalled it off of my Xbox One. No one is getting me to install it again. Goodbye Fortnite.

There are usually two different directions that game developers take once their game has picked up speed. Developers can try to increase the skill gap, or they can try to decrease the skill gap. Increasing the skill gap usually has the intentions of pursuing eSports, which appeals to the competitive gamer. Decreasing the skill gap usually has the intentions of pursuing money, while appealing to the casual gamer.

With the several recent updates Epic has put out, it seems that they have done a 180 in terms of what direction they are taking Fortnite. Nerfing building and buffing guns that require less skill are the two main changes that suggest this.

The DPS from subs is insane, making the game more call of duty-esque with the minimal time it takes to kill someone.

I don’t even carry a shotgun anymore because of how dominant smg spamming is at short range compared to the nerfed as hell shotgun.

From my perspective, I’m seeing updates that are attempting to cater to a younger and more casual audience.

That being said, you’re going to lose a player like me. Someone who has ground out every battle pass and has over 500 wins. (Not toting my goat here, just stating credentials so you can understand where I’m coming from)

It seems to me that you have a bunch of suits in an office writing on white boards that you need to change up the meta to keep things fresh and cater to the casual crowd.

I’m walking away until it’s fixed. If it gets fixed.

Austin

I think I've actually had enough Fortnite for today."" So thank you Epic for helping me curb my addiction to Fortnite. Before today I was able to play solos up to 18 hours a day without getting bored (played since s1, PSN: Theturdbuster69). But after encountering the p90 and other recently updated SMGs versus the new lower hp wood builds, I actually got fed up with playing solos. You can't hardly push anybody without taking severe damage and lose 9/10 close encounters that are shotgun vs SMG. So after playing a few solos I got a buddy to play some duos. Just to give the SMGs a shot, I ran 4 SMGs and 1 healer while he ran a similar setup. We picked up every drum gun, SMG and p90 we came across and we decimated everybody we came across that didn't have an equivalent setup. We faced at least 2 other duos that were highly skilled as we got into a bit of a build battle, but once we got the momentum going spraying away hip firing through all of their builds we came out victorious. I believe we won 1 or 2 games with this setup. It was a lot of fun however I feel terrible praying and spraying to win. With this said, I won't be playing solos until (hopefully) the next patch which is 90% of my time on fortnite. 

TL;DR Thank you Epic for giving 90% of my life back. I can finally become a productive member of society. (Or find another game to waste my time on)",FortNiteBR

So epic want to help them but it's at the risk of other players.  I saw somone post earlier that they think all these new changes with the new Spam Metta is so that new players have a chance to possible get a kill.  I personally think that is flawed.  Why should a player who has played on 20+ games and doesn't yet understand the game be able to kill a player who has 1000+ games just because that player is new.  Yes I understand that Epic wants to try and retain many new players but taking this route doesn't help them get any better in the game and when this spray and pray Metta is over what will they have learned.  I came in during season two and what a happened?.  I got double pumped, I got built on, basically everyone destroyed me.  However I learned from all of that, adapted and grew.  I figured out how to build, what weapons made me comfortable etc... Why? because I knew if I wanted to be better these are the things I had to learn not just spray spray spray.  And what makes it worse is its like Epic isn't really listening to the community.  After the pump nerf to where the heavy was the best shotgun everything was smooth.  Everyone knew double pump would be removed but it was OK because that's what the community asked for.  But now Epic is just bringing out build eaters after build eaters and nerfing mats but no one asked for this.  Nobody has every looked down and said wow I have too many mats. And every day people on this subreddit, the competitive subreddit, and Twitter complain and actually tell you they dislikes these changes but it's as if Epic don't care.  Like here's some changes I assume the community would like.  Bring back mats to the way they were because that's what got a lot of people's attention to the game the building, Remove the pull out time for the pump since the pump can't one hit nor double pump, decrease the DPS on smgs they will still be viable but being able to shred through 200 health in like 2 seconds and shred through builds is just complete B'S, fix the bloom on the AR, Fix the burst AR.

There you see how minimal building was - simple walls going up, and rather than building around obstacles we see jump pads being used to traverse the environment .

That shot where the tower was being attacked by a grenade launcher really hit close to me. You won't see that happening now because the skybase would have been swarmed by people building up alongside it.

The new SMG is completely fucking broken, and the community showed that the day it was released, but EPIC did nothing about it, other than making the problem worse by adding an epic and legendary variant of it. The reason the Tactical SMG had its ridiculous rate of fire was because it had bad damage, bad range and even worse drop-off damage, yet it was still a replacement to the recently nerfed shotguns. Then the Suppressed SMG got buffed, which was acceptable. It's great range, bloom and decent damage was balanced by it's lower fire rate and terrible drop-off damage. Then they scrapped the Tac SMG and decided to combine the ludicrous fire rate of the Tac and the better damage, spread and range of the suppressed, completely throwing off the balance. I desperately want to have fun as I still have great interest, but by standing by, the problem gets worse and worse. I'm all for switching up the meta, but the new SMG is not okay.",FortNiteBR

While it’s definitely unfair to just get melted down by a P90, Epic definitely knew what they were doing when they implemented the weapon into the game. Building is definitely the core/what makes Fortnite Fortnite, but if you’re conforming to one type of way to play the game (turtling) somewhere down the road people will begin to get tired of the same strategy to be used every game. I know seeing build battles are really cool, but those will eventually become obsolete in terms of awesomeness/creativity over time.

What I believe Epic was trying to do was implement a way to counter turtling, but they went over with what they wanted. However, the backlash they received was quite unwarranted. Balancing any game is no easy task, and overbuffing/underbuffing are both completely reasonable to expect out of a patch. To say that they won’t fix P90 (or SMG in general) is a stretch, and I won’t be surprised if they address this issue in the next patch. But for now, if the state of the game isn’t what you like it to be, then just play another game! That way the frustration won’t lead to more severe things and potentially quitting a game like Fortnite.

TL;DR Epic wanted SMGs to be a way to counter turtling but clearly overstepped, however the backlash they received is unwarranted since balancing a game is no easy task",FortNiteBR

I know there’s a bunch of these and most wont even care. I play on console and I’m a pretty competitive person who only has about 8 hours a week to play. I used to love playing this game, even when getting outplayed by better players, but when you continuously lose fights due to game mechanics and RNG, the frustration starts to boil over. 

You’re crouched, not moving with crosshairs dead center on your target and the game just decides you’ll only hit 3/30 shots. You want to put a wall there but the game decides you don’t get to build right now. Let’s nerf the hell out of the main mechanic in the game and then buff already OP weapons, all to appeal to the casuals. Triple SMGs, double shotguns, explosives that bring entire structures down requiring 0 skill, etc. Epic has done everything to kill the tremendous momentum they had. The meta doesn’t even include ARs or shotguns anymore. Does Epic really believe this is a good state of the game?

Being a console player doesn’t leave much options for BR games, but Realm Royale is starting console betas next week and I couldn’t be happier. My only hope is the streamers who promote the hell out of this game start dropping like flies so Epic can see the flaws in their ways.

The devs continuously make it evident that they will cater to bad players time and time again and the current state of the game makes that very obvious.

Skill is worth *nothing* is this game right now because any braindead player with Move Forward and Shoot bound to their controls can completely counter the one game mechanic that made Fortnite stand out- the building. 

Time and time again Epic proves that they don't like players using the BIGGEST CORE MECHANIC in this game, instead, they want this game to be free PUBG for little Ricky and and little Jimmy and they want them to be able to win games on their phone, on their PS4, and on their older brothers computer, even if they face off against Ninja or Tfue. As long as they've got a few SMGs or C4 or a grenade launcher, they can go toe-to-toe with any player at any skill level.

As a very high skill player, I genuinely can not wait to see this game be ruined by developers that can't acknowledge or appreciate an entire portion of their playerbase. 

If Epic doesn't find a way to reward skill very very soon then they're going to push away their most important players- the pros and the content creators, because they're the people that keep the game alive and relevant. ",FortNiteBR

If you weren’t winning games or getting kills, there was always something you could do better. Every move you could make had a reasonable counter you could do to stay alive.

Mid season 4, it seemed the updates all became unneccessary to the majority of the players. Even through all the questionable decisions made by Epic, their loyal playerbase stayed with them and kept grinding.

Not long before season 5 was underway, they just seemed to make very uninformed and drastic changes. Now it seems like Epic just says screw counters, screw skill-based mechanics, who needs balance anyway? 

Such irony it is that the day they celebrate their 1 year anniversery, they also practically put their game to death on the same day.

I know this is all opinions of mine, but i regret every hour I invested into getting better at a once fun game.

414,XFireEyeZ,1532473082,91mb4j,25,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/91mb4j/goodbye/,0,Goodbye.,"Well it all started when my friend, who is now a really good player, asked me if I wanted to play this new game. I was skeptical, saying it was just another PUBG copy. But boy was I wrong.

This was at the time of mid-season 2, which was, and still is in my opinion, the best season of fortnite battle royale. Not many people were good at the game, but my friend was (he is basically good at every game he plays). So he carried me to a few victories and I learned a bit about the game myself. We both even went so far as to where we bought the battle pass. (I made it to tier 37, and he made it to where he at least got floss.) 

Some of our other friends started playing the game, including my 2 best friends and my cousin who will be referenced further.

We were having a great time, I played the game every single day. But at the beginning of season 4, one of my best friends (won’t tell any names but let's call him Bob) stopped playing. I asked him to come back but he just said that he didn’t like the game anymore, that he was bored of it. 

And then one day, my cousin, ”Fred” also suddenly stopped. He was my favorite duo partner and I played with him basically every day. He also thought it was becoming boring.

By the time of season 4, week 6, I was one of the best of my friends at the game. I usually suck at every other game we play together, so this was a really fun experience for me having people saying things like: ”Hey man, have you played with this guy? He's really good.” about me. Now that I'm writing this my eyes actually start watering because I think it's kind of sad.

Anyhow, as season 4 comes close to an end  I start playing a game I haven’t played for a long time which I really enjoyed, Fallout 4, and kind of split my time between the two games. But I was anxious because I needed to play Fortnite to get full omega, but I kind of wanted to play Fallout more, so I asked my other best friend, ”Jack” to play on my account and try to get me to level 80. He said: ”Sure thing” and played a bit on it. But he was busy with some irl stuff and didn’t really have time to do anything.

One day, I hopped on to play a bit of Fortnite. I saw some new patches and updates e.g the dual pistols. I played a bit of playground with my friends. 0 kills. I was freaking out a bit since I wanted to play but didn’t really have the urge. I was like: ”Where the heck did my skill go?” I tried catching up with it again but it seemed impossible. I felt like, not to be offensive to anyone, but a noob. And with all the patches to the shotguns and everything the game felt so different. Different than it used to be. Different than the fun I used to have. Different than Fortnite.

I guess what I wanted to say with this post was that the game is not at all like what it used to be.  Not at all like the game we all fell in love with. So this is what you could call my ”letter of resignation ”.

It was fun while it lasted.  Kids, take breaks ever so often.   Don’t spend so much money on nothing.  And last of all, Goodbye.",FortNiteBR

With that being the case, I don't want to go back to double pump.  Here's my suggestion; with Epic having weekly updates they could easily just tweak guns until usage rates are relatively ""even""

Shotguns:  Increase headshot bonus on both shotguns to 2.5, add a delay for any weapon switched to after using a shotgun.  This would remove double pump, would remove pump to tac/smg, and would make you actually have to hit your shots.  One pump was ok when you actually had to aim. Heavy seems fair to me right now, except could be overshadowed by the pump, maybe lower damage falloff (tips?)

Explosives: Remove the ""through walls damage"" from everything but c4, grenades, and clingers again, keep rocket cap.  For c4, I think you should only be allowed to trigger the c4 once ever 15-30 seconds.  So, if you push and destroy an entire base you can't continue to do so.  You should take advantage of the first c4 to actually BUILD and use it as an advantage, not spam.

SMGs: lower headshot bonus to 2x, decrease damage to structures to half (like they did with tac shotguns).  Maybe decrease base damage 2-3 damage a shot.  SMGs have ridiculous dps right now and spamming builds takes away an important part of the game that allows for an actual skill cap.

AR's: Create a tighter bloom.  If they were dead accurate then everyone would be running strictly scars.  Reduce bloom so hitting shots at medium to long range is a little more viable.

Snipers: N/A

Revolver and Hand Cannon: significantly lower damage drop off.  I don't need a 150 damage headshot from 200m, but 60 is too low.

Dual Pistols: N/A (I like where these are at)

Silenced pistols: I feel like these guns get underused for their power, you should honestly try them out even with the current meta.  I think the recoil when continuously firing should be reduced a tad though.

Thank you to anyone taking the time to read, open to suggestions obviously.  I truly believe Epic has made some mistakes recently, but they update the game so frequently I don't think its unfixable.",FortNiteBR

Also it's obvious that the new P90 is good, it's legendary.

The wood nerf? It gets destroyed a little bit faster when you place them, 1 shot faster? Woah

Maybe they don't wanna buff materials because build fights are just dumb, and they don't want you to spend 2000 mats in a fight.

So I thought it would be a good idea to do it again for Epic. Yes I know, for most of you in this sub ""lol mobile."" The fact is that a huge chunk of Epic's revenue comes from mobile, and as of now we aren't being seen in the mobile subreddit. So I hope they see it here and listen (as they seem to have done for a bunch of issues last time).

1) \*\*autofire as the default setting is seriously OP and downplays people with skill\*\* Stepping in front of a new player before they even realize it shouldn't result in death.

Suggestion: please make autofire take at least half a second of continuous manual crosshair / object detection before a gun fires. There should be at least \*some\* intent on the users' part to fire the weapon.

2) \*\*Guns fire every time you try to pick up weapons or drops with a gun selected\*\* 

Suggestion: Simple bug fix I assume.

4) \*\*we still need a way to crouch in build mode\*\* Can we please add that in as one of the extra buttons in the customizable HUD?

5) \*\*we still need a stats screen?\*\* it doesn’t need to be fancy. I just want to know how many wins I have. Please, please, please add this. If it's somehow shareable (eg, automatically sends a photo to your camera roll and social media, I can see the social component of this helping drive even more usage).

6) \*\*Positional Audio is still not working\*\* It remains impossible to know if footsteps or gunshots are coming from behind me or in front of me. On a mobile screen in particular we have less visual references to figure it out. So if I'm being shot at, my only recourse is usually to spin around and do a 1x1 until I can peak and figure out where it's coming from. This is very unideal.

7) \*\*We still need a load screen reminder suggesting to put the phone in Do Not Disturb mode\*\* 

so many squad games get interrupted by one of the players getting a phone call or text. While this isn’t epic’s fault, it would be great to remind people and so simple to add.

8) \*\*Voice chat doesn't work with bluetooth headphones, including Apple's airpods\*\* Can this please be fixed. While we're at it, can you please put some kind of icon next to a player's name indicating whether they have a mic enabled or not? It's pretty confusing still.

9) \*\*WE NEED SOME KIND OF EPIC PRESENCE IN THE /r/FORTNITE_MOBILE SUBREDDIT\*\* Pretty please, can one of the product managers or game engineers tasked with mobile check in once in a while? This is really the wrong sub to be posting mobile issues in. We report bugs there, but they are never seen. Thanks!

10) \*\*BUILD PRESETS\*\* Building on mobile is really, really hard unless you are one of the people who have mastered the awkward ""claw"" hand position. What would be wonderful are some additional build macro presets. For example, a single button that lets me build a protective ramp triangle (floor, wall and ramp) at once and uses corresponding mats. I'd love to see big build battles on mobile, but until we address this in other ways, it's never really going to be common place and Fortnite will remain a shooter with the ability to make ramps and some basic bases. And that's such a letdown from the amazing potential you find on console.

I‘m expecting an official post soon, announcing that they heard the feedback and are looking into it. There is no way that this kind of backlash goes unnoticed.

So be patient brothers. There is a possibility that Epic won’t acknowledge the backlash but that one is very very slim.

(Btw. Mods: You’re not Epic employees so you could easily do this. Why not sticky a poll thread where people can vote for what they like/dislike in the game currently. You could use strawpoll or any other website. That way there is a higher chance that Epic sees our feedback and actually answers it)",FortNiteBR

This makes some sense since In the playground trailers Epic showed pyramids and Sphinxs. The road trip outline also looks like it could be a pharaoh. 

   I think that it is not a pyramid, but rather Atlantis that may appear from the depths of the lake. It would make sense right? 
   
    For people who don’t know, Atlantis is (or was) an ancient city that supposedly became submerged in water. 

     Because the visitor screwed up some stuff with the space time continuum, Atlantis could emerge from beneath the water as it seems time has been rewinding or going up to the future in areas of the map in 3 corners except the northeastern corner. We have the Norse village in the southeast, lazy links in the northwest or maybe wailing or lonely will get a change, and in southwest we have an old western vibe coming from areas of the desert around paradise. 

     It would also make sense in a way because it is history themed and it’s covered in water just like Atlantis is supposed to be if it actually exists. Wouldn’t a pyramid be uncovered in the desert not the water?

    I really don’t think it’s a volcano because of how perfectly symmetrical it is. 

    People also think it could be a ship. Who keeps ships in a lake? It would be very cool to see a galleon in loot lake, maybe even with working cannons that use rockets as ammo, but I don’t think so just because it’s “loot lake” and not “galleon gallows” or something. It’s not large enough to hold a galleon either.

If Epic isn't making drastic changes to their game, they are not taking advantage of beta testing. If they weren't changing anything the player base would get bored and move onto the next game.

Epic is still just as involved in the community as everand they know that the current meta is not as it should be. They just want to see how people adapt to major changes. The player base is strong and will probably not suffer much. The devs have balls to do this.

(not joking),"First time Fortnite poster on reddit, been around since Season 3 and really just wanted to post Epic some love with all the hate going around.

This new meta is a blast so far!! It is different than everything previously.  You mean I get to try new weapons and compete in a whole new way than ever before?!  HECK YES I'll take it.

One of my favorite things in the game is to try new guns when they come out.  Mostly in the past, new gun gets added, its garbage, go back to AR and Shotguns.  Then it was Double Shotguns.  No matter what, if you didn't AR and Shotgun, you better snipe like no one's business or you are gone for good.

This has changed.  There is added bonus for being a good distance shot and a good close range player.  Heck the Dual Pistols are a blast right now and I have wrecked people with them when I can't find an smg.  

But in the end, people HATE change, which I never understand.  Image if this game's Map was the same as it was day 1, same buildings, same places, same loots same everything.  No new guns, no new skins, no new nothing.  You all would HATE IT.  Instead there is constant updates and changes that make it intriguing and changing the FREE game to be different and enjoyable.

NOW they also do that with the game play and guns and all that.  Heck I won a Squad last night solo, little sneak, little rockets, little AR, never touched an SMG (I shouldnt have stood a chance since I didn't find an SMG according to all of you right?).  Different game play, means different learning and trying new things.  If you HATE trying new things, then pray for no new updates EVER.  I LOVE updates and finding new ways to play this FREE game. I hope they keep changing things up for different play styles.  Balance is almost impossible in any game, hell, ask Blizzard about balance and classes lol and they are the SHIT!.  

Id rather see imbalance and learning new things than perfect balance and boring same game play any day.  But in the end, this FREE game has held my attention for 22 weeks so far and they continue to do so better and better.  GREAT WORK EPIC, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK",FortNiteBR

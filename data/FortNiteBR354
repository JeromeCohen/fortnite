I playin this game about a month, but is so hard to get better, cause the fk tryhard players with 8-10 hour/day playtime. Sometimes i try to play a duo or a squad, but in my team, all the fkin time 8-16 years old kids, really beginners, cant build, cant shoot, nothing, but face against fk tryhard experinced players, they can build, shoot, rush, anything. Its just too many times, so hard to get a kill or a win cause of these players. Dont say just play and you will get better, cause it sucks. Why can epic just add a skill based matchmaking, like a normal game. Its a win win, cause everybody play with their on skill level, and in time everybody gets better, and maybe the game is more enjoyable. Really not fun when you get one shot in the face seven times in a row, and you cant do nothing cause the player is a nerd, who plays this game 24/7. Suggestions? Will SBMM coming?

I love the go\-to of ""It didn't come with a console. You shouldn't be able to use it."". Yet not a single word is said about Elite controllers with back switches that can be mapped. Making it so you have more control options. Giving you an ""unfair"" advantage. You are not going to get a ""fair"" experience like most like to assume. There are different versions of the same console that can run smoother and have better graphics. There are controllers that have more buttons. There are people with very nice headsets and some with the 99 cent one you got on purchase. If you think one way to play is better, then do it. Stop crying and wanting the game changed over your dumb assumptions. Spend a few bucks if you think something is so much better that is the reason you lose fights. I would bet most people complaining would die just as much, if not more, if they used what they thought gave them an ""advantage."". My advice? Get better at the game. The only thing keeping you at the assumed ""disadvantage"" is yourself. It is plug and play and costs $20 for a M&amp;KB. The price of 1 skin. 

Edit: getting a kick out of all the people butt hurt who have never even tried all the controls on console yet think they know best. Especially after some bring up getting aim assist with M&amp;KB. Oh my. I see why this is so hard for people to understand. They never took time to learn.",FortNiteBR

I understand that some people feel that it is not balanced to be able to peek and get a perfect accuracy shot, I disagree. To me, being able to do this quickly, and repetitively is something that requires skill, therefore removing it decreases the skill gap in my opinion. Having to sit at the top of your ramp for 2 seconds before FBA pops up feels terrible for the game.

In my opinion after playing all day on this update it is that if they keep it the way it is right now that they should lower the time it takes for FBA to come into affect, it just feels clunky and unwelcome in my opinion.

Hear me out.

Every week we have been given challenges with a week in between each set. Every reward for completing 4/7 has been 4K EXP.

However with the Week 10 set being in 2 days, and the season ending in 6 days... I am starting to believe there is a reason they put question marks over the rewards until that week. There are only 4 days to complete Week 10's challenges before season 4 begins. 

Leads me to believe it will probably be a glider or harvesting tool of some sort. Maybe a back bling?

Me and my brother both agree the colour blind mode needs a change. 
     I'm sure this isn't an issue very many people face, but the colourblind mode is not very effective. I'm a pretty extreme Deutan and most common problem is determining what rarity my guns are. Without the colourblind mode on, I cannot tell if I am picking up a blue or an epic (I can exit into my inventory and look at the gun description, but thats such an unnecessary step, and waste of time). If I turn colourblind mode on, I cannot tell if I am picking up a green or a grey (this is very difficult to determine what floor gun to pickup on drop). I have tried playing with the sliders and I still cannot find a setting where my brain can grasp the colour tiers of guns. My suggestion simply is, for colourblind mode, add the amount of stars the weapon has in the hotbar. This way I can see tell what tier the weapon is without having to stop moving and checking my inventory. 

TLDR; Add the stars for gun rarity into the hotbar, when colourblind mode is on.",FortNiteBR

So basically, a while back I was playing with a friend. I had the game for about 3 days or so at that point in time. We played a few games before I went to walk my dog. When I came back, I was logged out of the epicgames launcher and when I tried logging back in, I was banned. I emailed the support which told me that I was observed cheating. 
Now, what I don't understand is how I, having played every single one of my games with said friend of mine and only having won a single game (during which I didn't get any kills, I was hiding in the waterfall), only ever having had one decent game during which I got one headshot with an auto-rifle and then got killed, got banned. My friend wasn't banned so I'm not sure what I did. I didn't have any ""fishy"" programs or any cheats for fortnite, nor for any other videogames running or even saved on my computer. Mailing the support doesn't help whatsoever and I'd very much like to play this game again.
Is there any way to get unbanned given the listed circumstances?

Finally, they had fixed a lot of qualify of life problems in the last big patch - which ironically brought the servers down and we couldn't play anyway - and I thought I would FINALLY give Fornite another chance to redeem itself.

Not to mention, how ugly the game is and blurry the textures making it very hard to see people in the distance. 

If the lag-spikes and the server ping spikes ever get smoothed out, I may consider coming back. I'm honestly thinking about building a new PC or buying an Xbox One X and get back into the more immersive 4K single player games and take a good break from competitive stuff for a while. 

Fortnite is the best game in the world right now, if you are playing it on PC. I have a PC, the smoothness is night and day. 

Thanks for listening, just needed to rant. Have a good day guys. ",FortNiteBR

Mom goes away and it's quiet, then I come in and say ""can I go to Charleston?"" The kid's voice is shaking and he's like I'm not going to Charleston, and I said yes you're going on a field trip. I guess he doesn't realize his mic is on and he calls his mom back over, said that some guy (lol) on his team overheard her talking and now a stranger knows he's going to Charleston. Mom immediately gets pissed, says I told you no talking to strangers online, says no more Fortnite, last thing I hear is the boy begging to finish the match, then he disconnects.

I always need to carry a long ranged, short ranged and medium ranged weapon and then some shields and health.

I want to use them but i just never have any room for em. I think it would be nice to get our own throawables spot but at the same time you could still put more throwables in your normal inventory if you wanted to. Maybe epic could introduce this and add something like a incendiary, gas or spiked grenades?

 The buildings in a heart: The person probably lives in tilted towers or grew up there, so he is drawing tributes to the place.
The meteorite drawing is probably to refer to for his research.
 The- today- tomorrow probably is because he keeps on seeing those meteor showers which is players see in our games so much now. He or she probably thinks that meteorite will hit today but when it doesn’t they cross it out and write tomorrow because of how many meteorites we see in one game (I saw 17 in my last game).

We understand this. This game “just seems to balance itself out,” as Shroud once said in conversation with Ninja.

Without the building component, the chemistry of the weapons in gameplay would fling radically off kilter making players hypersensitive to the slightest nuances in weapon differences. There is a reason we say “just build lol” almost anytime someone complains about something.

So here is my argument, and why I think mini-guns were an insidious addition to the game.

While someone is damaging and destroying your immediate structures, you have multiple opportunities at your will.

**A.)** Return fire while they’re aiming at your structures.
**B.)** Build and repair.
**C.)** Runaway.
**D.)** Close the distance.

These are normal responses to a normal situation. We face these challenges every game. We address the situation accordingly, perform, and hope for the best. Opportunities and challenges like these are what define the complexity of this game.

What happens when you’re behind cover in an open field and someone is destroying your structures at almost the same rate you’re placing them with a high RPM weapon that does 45 damage per headshot at medium-long range (which you’re at) and doesn’t have to reload?

**A.)** You return fire while they’re aiming at your structures. You’ll likely damage the shooter—sure. But if you’re peaking, the structures from which you’re peaking simply won’t hold. They’re already aiming at you. You will very likely take damage. You may die.

**B.)** You build and repair. You’re smart. You know ramps are an opportunity to peak and are a failsafe if the wall breaks. You’re repairing the ramp at the same time as replacing the walls. Your walls are constantly being destroyed. The ramp is eating so much damage that the repairs aren’t helping. The ramp breaks. Your placing walls and ramps. They’re both braking. The high RPM is sneaking bullets through. You almost certainly take damage. You may die.

**C.)** You runaway. You take shit loads of damage. Maybe you turn and build a little as you runaway, but those fresh walls are crushed while you’re running away. You took damage. You might die.

**D.)** You close the distance. You know your only way of closing the distance while staying protected by structures is by building up via the incline of a ramp. You know better than to do this—he has a mini-gun and will drop your ramp. You instead zig zag from wall-protected-ramp to wall-protected-ramp. You take damage. You take more the closer you get. You may die.

This weapon always hurts whoever is down range if they’re alone and don’t have natural structures nearby. This weapon is used by less experiences players that don’t realize they’re likely to be killed, and nonetheless, hold the trigger and aim down field guaranteeing some hits.

*The only way to approach someone while completely protected is by ramping over them. There is no other approach aside from approaching someone perfectly from the NE, SE, SW, or NW with grounded ramps which is very precarious against the mini-gun, just like ramping straight up.*

In summary (I don’t know the Reddit lingo), this gun is annoying. It’s alluring to noobs. It always damages you. If you’re outnumbered at all, you’re almost certainly dead. In close quarters it does so much damage that if your don’t shoot them in the head immediately with a pump you’re dead. It wastes your resources. No one uses it because it’s only truly useful if you’re a suicidal maniac. 

——————EDIT———————
I have a 12 k/d and a 50% w/l in solos for s3 (MarkyTwain). I know how to build. I know how to shoot. The point is that the weapon (which is rarely used because it **is** indeed trash) always *hurts* you. Not because it always kills me.",FortNiteBR

Bloom existing.

SMG's and regular pistols are worthless and should be avoided at all costs.

People who are lagging will still land shots if you peek even slightly (standing up, shooting then crouching again) leading to you getting shot for 100 damage in some cases when you've been happily camping in you little tower for 2 seconds without peeking.

How getting hard to make headshots with a Hand Cannon also has a pretty insane damage range.

And based off player feedback, i guess it would be overall more pleasing to have refunds available on items that haven’t been used over a set period of time played.

For example: 
I can refund a skin because i have not used it for longer than 2 hours (game time) but i cannot refund another skin that i’ve used for 2+ hours.

I think that is a happy solution to the refund system. What do you think?

EDIT:
I just want to clarify that i currently applaud Epic giving any form of refund and in my own opinion agree with the way they have handled refunds.

The fact that skins have been on sale for longer than a refund system is obviously going to stop a lot of people that genuinely bought a skin by mistake months ago from having their money back. ",FortNiteBR

If Fortnite doesnt atleast show off the LMT Shooting Test #2 by then I could see some people switching over. H1's BR doesnt have building at all but I'll definitely try it out just for the shooting.

Would kind of be funny if the Fortnite shooting test #2  happened the week H1 has its beta. Although I do want it much sooner than that.

   Why do people feel the need to do that? I usually NEVER see a Fortnite player commenting on a PUBG post saying that ""PUBG is trash, blah blah blah."" I used to see this stuff all the time back when Call of Duty and Battlefield were top dogs. Battlefield usually had a player base that consisted of people were thought they were more ""mature"" because they played a more ""realistic"" game. (Yeah sure, because everyone can deploy a parachute everytime they fall 10 feet). What makes PUBG players feel the need to constantly bash Fortnite? Both games are fun in their own perspectives.

   Now i've always been pretty neutral about both games (CoD/BF) because each game has their strengths and weaknesses. This also applies to Fortnite/PUBG as well. I enjoy both games for what they are in an extremely fun game genre. I tend to be on Fortnite more mainly because I play on PS4 with my friends a lot more. But if I had the chance, I would most likely play both moderately because they are both  FUN.

TL;DR. Why is the PUBG fanbase a bunch of little crybabies torwards Fortnite?",FortNiteBR

We started off with 100% bloom which many players dislike because they feel that the randomness hinders skilled players. Then you added first shot accuracy, which you balanced by reducing the headshot multiplier on some guns and introducing damage drop off. Now, in this most recent patch you've essentially made first shot accuracy useless, so we're now stuck with 100% bloom, nerfed headshots, and damage drop off all together. In my opinion, we've actually taken a huge step backwards and are currently in a state worse than where we started with the original 100% bloom accuracy. 

I hate to complain without offering a solution, but I really don't know the right way to fix this. Perhaps the individuals responsible for balancing the game can open a dialog with some of the top Fortnite players and get some good ideas from them and try them out in some more LTM shooting tests.

Teammates impulsing each other off cliffs to get supply drops, shooting down team ramps etc. It's like a competition against your own team in the initial phase.

I think if we get rid of the whole looting angle and allow players to spawn with a random load out, which will include a shotty, AR, sniper, shield and bandages, we can get rid of the team toxicity and concentrate on strategies. Sure there will be lot around but you spawn with the basics. The load out can be random or you could get a mix of grey, green,blue only one of each guranteed. 

I am not sure about mats. We could try unlimited mats for crazy forts or we could give players 999 each. I am honestly okay with 0 too.

One of the biggest factors in 50vs50 is your bus' trajectory in comparison to the circle. If the circle is not in the middle of the map and is around lonely ridge or the other side, buses who start their journey from that side have an advantage because players usually jump off early and secure the circle. The other team is usually wasting time collecting resources and getting to the circle in small numbers without co-ordination and dying in isolation.

I started playing Fortnite because of my freind. His PC is too weak to handle PUBG, heck it even struggles with Overwatch. But he has PS4 so Fortnite was available. and here is the first HUGE advantage of Fortnite: cross-platform play. It might seem a bit unfair to the gamepad players, but at the end of the day when playing squad or duo, teamplay and luck matter a bit more than fast aim (at least for us), not to mention it delivers on all the fun and you can actually play with all your friends regardless of the platform.
so Pros and Cons are as follows

**Pros:**

* Fortnite is optimized. I'm running a fairly old system (i7 975, 6Gb ram, R9 380 4Gb) and framerate is silky smooth 60fps on medium.

* Ultrawide support. 21:9 is nothing to sneeze at, i'm sure UWMR people will agree with me on this one.

* Cross-platform play. Already explained that one.

* F2P. Free to play BR is nice and makes the game even more accessible.

* Art design. While not exactly my cup of tea, it allows for a clean crisp picture without loading up your GPU to 100% all the time, thanks to simple textures and good optimization.

* Netcode. It has one, not the Battlefield 4 launch levels of atrocity that PUBG has.

* Inventory. You pick up an item - it takes up one slot. you have 5 slots. Ammo doesnt take slots, so you just need to manage those 5 slots.

* Shotguns are actually useful. In fact almost all weapons are useful. (but i still suck with shotguns). Also when you hear that chest SFX, you know you're going to get a weapon, not run into 100 lv1 vests without a single pistol (bad luck in PUBG happens quite often, esp in squad matches)

* Building. Disorienting at first (especially when you accidentally switch your weapon to building in the middle of a gunfight at extreme close range), allows for some defence in the open fields and such, not to mention when you're running from the storm zone, building ramps and bridges will save you more often than not.

**Cons:** (a bit picky tbh, but it's strictly my opinion and cons are open for discussion)

* Party servers are busy/Party is not accepting join requests. Joining my friend's party was a chore, probably due to russian laws and government trying to disable telegram and banning a lot of IP adresses, but still.

* CQC Gunplay is bunnyhopping and spamming fire in the general direction of the enemy.

* Building and mining the resources. I played enough of minecraft, thank you. Being able to build stuff is fine, but when you see a bunch of people pop out entire cities in less than 10 seconds instead of doing gunfights, it looks a bit ridiculous.

* F2P grind. Devs need their money, i get it. but at least allow me to create my character myself, i don't want to play random char every other game.

* RPG is useless. Guided missile is somewhat balanced, but unguided RPG7 is painfully slow.

* Sound design. PUBG has amazing sound design, i can hear shots from like 500 meters, i can tell the direction, i can tell when i'm shot at, i can tell the distance to a person who shoots without flash hider due to sound design. PUBG sound is amazing, you jsut have to use headphones.

* Lack of transport. Fortnite's map is small, yes. but when you get duped over by the zone and have to run all time just to get killed in the last 3-2 zones because zone was too random is meh. At least in PUBG you have the chance of getting into a car and outrunning the zone.

* No prone position.

* Art design. While good in general, it's too vibrant for my eyes. Not to mention i'm not a fan of cartoony style games (exceptions being Wind Waker and TF2)

* No first person view.

* Zone wall is too opaque. When you're running for your life in the storm, you can't see what's awaiting for you inside the zone because the wall is too opaque, easy to miss an enemy or something.

* Unreal launcher. We don't need another Uplay or Origin, please use Steam.

In general Fortnite is a great game. It's well optimized, easy on the eyes (just don't play in the dark room) and free to play. If you haven't treid it yet (which is unlikely since you're reading this subreddit), i recommend you do. It kind of has this 'Easy to learn, hard to master' thingie. It's easy to jump in, but the gameplay with building and gunplay has a lot of depth to it, so there's always some room to improve. Too bad it's not exactly my kind of game. For all the people, hating on either PUBG or Fortnite BR - those are different games. While the idea of BR is similar, there's just too many differences between those games to compare them directly.
For me Fortnite BR just doesnt give that thrill of sneaking up on someone. PUBG is closer to tactical shooters, while Fortnite is an arcade third person shooter.
All pros and cons are open for discussion as my opinion might be flawed and is obviously biased. Ultimately i want for both Fortnite and PUBG to improve and be better games, so we as gamers would always have choice and fun.

**TL;DR is this: Fortnite is 2arcady4me, but is still awesome and you should definetly check it out(check out PUBG while you're at it, chances are you have a friend on steam who has the game and is willing to familyshare it with you). Also i'm colourblind and Fortnite is a bit more difficult for my eyes than PUBG, as funny as it sounds.**

P. S. Emotes make me cringe btw, idk why but they do.

Since it would be limited in quantity due to only one token per season (which is a long time between tokens in itself), it wouldn't be able to really be abused or anything either.

As for why I use Battle Pass as the method, it's because people who don't invest in the Battle Pass aren't really buying stuff anyways.

The blue revolver will hit for 24 damage, and the legendary hand cannon is barely any better at 31 damage. For reference, a legendary SCAR at max range will hit for 24 damage *per bullet* and fires much faster!

The net result is that these precision pistols feel incredibly unsatisfying. They do too little damage to be used effectively at long range, and they're never going to be a first choice in close quarters combat due to their slow fire rate. 

If Epic could fix/bring into line the damage drop-off for these pistols it would make them actually have a place in the game. It would also give people more options of what guns to use and therefore increase gun variety (I don't think I've ever come across somebody using these guns so far).

It was heavily implied that all future battlepasses will cost v-bucks as well. And why would Epic switch back after a wildly successful season?

“But epic is worried people will return their skins to buy the battlepass!” 

For one, you get to do this three times. And only three times. It’s not really something you want to be going around doing all willy nilly, and I’m sure epic knows this. They figure if players want to sacrifice a third of their refunds for a battlepass why do they care, likely they’re profiting here either way. 

Secondly, if you spend 20$ on a 2k v bucks skin,  and refund it, assuming you buy nothing else that’s two battlepasses you can buy. Or 20$ total. Epic isn’t losing any money here. It’s just a different form of redistribution. 

So I suggest everyone relax. They wouldn’t fuck their player base like this. It *is* just speculation true but so is people assuming season 4 will cost real money so hey. ",FortNiteBR

I strongly disagree, this is the only thing that keeps a big skill gap between console and PC now IMO.

I play on 7 sensitivity for aiming, and would happily play on highest settings for building if it was possible! Console needs this! (I’m on Xbox)

for example say you play at 7 sensitivity but prefer to have a 10 sensitivity when building with no aim assist.. allowing for you to build much faster and then when you switch to your weapon your sensitivity would go back to your original/ads sensitivity.

I feel as if every patch epic games is making it hard for fast gunfighters to have an advantage? Things such as weapon swapping, editing and swapping, fast peaking, building them shooting and many more fast pace gunfight mechanics are all being made more slow and clunky every as clearly seen in the last 4-5 patch notes. 

Sure you can build through more structures but I feel as if the game is just becoming more and more how high can you build over your opponent instead of how quick you can outplay your opponent. Sure you can build through fences in the newest patch but the gunfights still have such lower skillcaps than before.

I liked always having room to improve my mechanics with peaking and swapping but now all I feel I need to focus on learning is how to outbuild someone for absolute height advantage every fight and the game is just not as fun to me. Sure I'm complaining and still going to play the game regardless but am I really the only one who feels this way and if not why doesn't epic try to make a larger fighting skill instead of smaller or just changing it as a whole? Delaying weapon swapping in no way increases the skillcap of fighting other than maybe making players focus on building. It just took time to learn how to use these mechanics and it is what separated the good from the bad. The double pump was definitely unhealthy but other variations of swapping were fine to me. 

Just wished there was more to work for than just building as fast as I can and staring down at someone and spraying at them because they can't fast peak and neither can I.

I realize their player base exploded and they most likely don't have the man power to help everyone but it's ridiculous.

I've emailed support, I've submitted bug reports in game like they ask, I've submitted the crash report every time I crash. Their automated email says to post on the forums, which I can't post in the Tech Support forum. I've been trying to get help for this issue for over a month. It's not something with the current patch, it's been happening and keeps happening. 

My game just randomly freezes and then crashes. It comes up to the Unreal Engine 4 Crash Reporter says ""An Unreal process has Crashed: UE4-FortniteGame-Athena"". I've researched this error and can't find anything. It used to crash nearly every game, now I have it down to just randomly every handful of games by limiting my FPS. It helped, but the crashes still happen. I have all the logs from the crashes I can upload. I have updated my nVidia drivers every time a new one has came out. I verified my game files. 

I want to buy skins and support this game but I cannot bring myself to buy and V-bucks when this is my experience.

I remember about a DECADE ago, I'd come home from school and hop online with my friends on Xbox. We'd play Halo 3, Reach, Call of Duty, you name it. Then we could go online and watch funny clips being acted out by players in those games. It was a wild time.

Undeniably, Fortnite has brought so many people together. It's all over the internet and very mainstream. Seems like everyone can share a laugh at relatable gameplay videos.

After a long hiatus (in my perspective), gaming videos are coming back with full force. I love watching the videos everyone posts on this subreddit. There's so much effort put into them and they're all very entertaining.

There are limitless possibilities when the game leaves early-access. I hope Epic implements a special ""Free Build"" mode that encourages pushing the limits of creativity.

1.It adds to the loot pile where currently, I'm still trying to learn the old weapons
2.They usually end up being used at the start of the patches and then slowly fade to never being picked up again because generally the majority of players stick to their comfortable loadout
3.They don't actually make the game feel fresh, just mildly annoys me when I see something I'm not used to

I'm not sure who epic is trying to target this game for, but it seems as though it's directed to the crowd that like to do 360 no scopes and get highlight reels. Which, no beef against them, it makes the people like myself, who want to be somewhat competitive in the game and get better at the core mechanics feel discouraged when you see nothing added to cater to you where I'm not sure how small of a minority we are. 

Some things that I would like to see that might make the game feel fresh to me is a practice mode, an official matchmaking ladder (elo), private servers to scrim against friends, or a change to the rng shooting mechanics. Personally, if this game continues to head to this route, I don't see myself playing for a long time, new items don't keep me entertained. An active goal or some sort of reward is what keeps me doing anything, and after so many wins, the victory royale gets dull.",FortNiteBR

I saw it on the ground, and from my angle, it was by itself. Legendary, in just a normal chest. I didn't stop to think of why it was there, or why I heard the sound of a shield potion being drunk near it. I simply picked it up, and left. There were others around the factory, and I simply slunk into the crowd, but when I looked behind, and saw you emerge from around the corner, having drunk your shield potion and now having space for your loot, I felt sadness. But before I could do anything, the ambush came. Two armies bet, as it is in 50v50. The enemy fort on top of the mountain towering above our team, and it seemed like every single point on that fort was an enemy, armed to the teeth. Our team, now a scattered assembly of people fleeing for cover or desperately building, were decimated. Hails of bullets and grenades came from above. Any attempt to run was met by relentless sniper fire. You couldn't fight back, for peaking out was death. Me, You, and Others just sat in confusing metal and brick forts, hearing explosions and death outside. Then, after our team was broken and divided, with loot covering the ground, legions of hostiles dropped in. Many came down the mountain is bridges, while many others flew down on wings of hate, propelled by the boost pads looted from Tilted Towers. Shotgun and Scar Wielding enemies ripped apart the factory buildings. If you were downed, that was it. We didn't have time to run. So, when all was lost, we ran to the only remaining factory building, and gave it a last stand. It was 9v43. But we held strong. For every 1 we lost, the enemy lost 4. In the last 2v13, I saw a Rust Lord. You still had that Carbine, the same one you held before it all went wrong. I suppose you never had time to find any actual Assault Rifle, since you thought the Scar would always be there. You fought like hell, like a hundred John Wicks. Dodging, building, firing. You killed 7 enemies by yourself, while I just watched, too scared to let the enemy know of my position. But, when I saw another Rust Lord para-drop down from the heavens and pull out his Assault Rifle, and you turn back, It all ended. You hit every shot. If it were a scar, the headshots would've taken the enemy out no problem. But no, your gun wasn't good enough, and he shot you down. I want to tell you that I avenged you, that I killed the remaining 6, that I won the game as the sole survivor, but in truth, I was just gunned down by 6 Scars. The game was 20 minutes of frantic looting and more frantic shooting, but to me it was so much more. It was an experience. I'm so sorry.",FortNiteBR

I personally agree with it. Idk just thinking about it, it kinda bums me out that it’s so common. At the start of the season I was so ready to grind to tier 100 and earn it. (I mean yeah the people that buy 0-100, whatever. That’s another discussion though) But I feel like they pretty much just handed him out (compared to the black knight). I mean sure there was some down time, which they compensated for. I feel like they could’ve did it in a different way though. 

I earned mine 0-100 with the help of challenges of course, and I just don’t really think he has the “pazaz” he once did since everyone has him.

I feel like it would be cool to have an exclusive skin or something for those who grinded the whole way out without tier purchasing/assistance from the free battle stars they gave out. 

Thoughts?

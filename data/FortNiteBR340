However, once I’m in the top 10 circle I find myself being the target of 3-5 people shooting at me simultaneously. Like wtf?! Every time! I usually hug the circle as it comes in too so it’s not like I’m in the center of the circle. 


It’s happened 5 times in a row right now and Im frustrated as to what I could have done differently but it seems just super fucking unlucky that the guy camping salty, the guy who port-a-fort in the middle, and the guy coming out of the circle just all happen to decide to shoot me at the same damn time every damn time!",FortNiteBR

## Features

* Set mouse sensitivity to an exact value
* Set values like HUD scale outside of their normal range
* Add custom binds
    * Slow walk on PC with InputScale for your John Wick roleplay
    * Turn binds! Use the ActionNames TurnAtRate and LookUpAtRate with InputScale set to the desired degrees per second. Use a negative InputScale to turn left or look down.

## How does it work?

This program uses the Fortnite API and uploads your edited ClientSettings file to https://fortnite-public-service-prod11.ol.epicgames.com/fortnite/api/cloudstorage/user/[AccountId]/ClientSettings.sav with a PUT request. This is how Fortnite itself does it when you change your settings.

The login screen works exactly like the Epic launcher's, including functioning Google and Facebook single sign-on. It's an embed of https://launcher-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com//epic-login that uses Javascript callbacks to receive an OAuth exchange code back from the login page. It sends that exchange code to https://account-public-service-prod03.ol.epicgames.com/account/api/oauth/token which replies with a Fortnite API token for your account.

This program doesn't modify or interact with your game in any way.

## Instructions

You can start either by opening your cached ClientSettings file at ""User\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Cloud\[Epic account id]\ClientSettings.sav"" or using File -&gt; Cloud Import to download it off Epic's cloud.

When you use Cloud Import or Cloud Export, you'll be given a login window that looks and functions like the Epic launcher's. If you don't want to type your account info into a third party program, use Google or Facebook single sign-on and you can log in through your browser.

**Saving over the cached file won't do anything!** You have to use Cloud Export to upload the edited file for your changes to take effect.

To change a property's name or value, just edit the text boxes.

To duplicate or delete a property, right click it and use the context menu. When duplicating a property, the copy will be placed directly after the original. This is how you add and remove keybinds.

Properties won't appear if they're still default. You can set them in-game or duplicate a property of the same type and rename it.",FortNiteBR

*My suggestion to make thanos more powerful is, Make him regen hp when not getting hit for 5 seconds, the regen can be 20 hp/s or even 50 hp/s... Why's that? If you guys see, no one wants to be thanos on the beggining of a match, just people who don't know that If you get thanos early you will die, because you can't regen health, just shield and you have to kill someone to regen shield, and if you kill people and get damaged, you are pretty much doomed to die by the end of a match, Now if thanos regen hp when not getting hit, people will want to become thanos, because he will be good from the beggining to the end of a match, and there will be more people focusing him, because the way it is now, people don't try to kill thanos, just when there's like 10 people left, so you can get the gauntlet and win the game. People will have to fight together to destroy thanos, so they can survive, I think it's a good change for the mode, what do you guys think?

*And one more thing, guys It's fucking Thanos, It's supposed to be strong, the mode is limited, it wasn't supposed to be, NO SKIN BUSH BEATS THANOS ASS, no, it was supposed to be, thanos wipes entire earth with a laser comming from the sky, and another thing I noticed is, he takes too much time to jump, if there's 2 good shooters shooting him when he tries to charge the jump, he will be dead before he can even left ground, so I mean, epic, pleaaaase, make this event be remembered by people getting smashed by thanos, people really feeling that there is a boss outhere, and not the way it is now.

Enough with all of the posts asking for Thanos to be powerful enough to kill all 99 other players on the map. 
  
This game mode doesn’t, and SHOULDN’T, exist to gratify MCU power scalings. 
  
If you all got your way, the only posts this sub would see are ones entitled “Thanos is too strong, only one person gets the infinity gauntlet per game &gt;:(“.
  
***The reason Thanos seems weak*** is that it’s the first day of the mode, most people are still getting him for the first time; people suck at using him because they’re new to him. I literally 1v1’d him, not because Thanos is weak, but because the person decided to abuse his leap and allowed me to kite him.
  
So if you get the infinity gauntlet, ***DO NOT ABUSE/OVERUSE THE LEAP, OR YOU WILL DIE.***
  
***As time goes on***, people will get better with Thanos.
  
This game mode was never meant to make Thanos a “Boss”, it’s simply a really cool, really fun, “kill the man with the ball” style game mode.
  
Rock on, Epic. You guys continue to be one of the best game companies around.

Combat is my weakest point at the moment, so it would be nice to know more about how to move during combat and proper engagement. Thanks in advance!

Here's a quick list of what I've learned by myself so far:

- Survival is key. Don't engage unless you need to. Try not to die before the first circle.

- Gather as much resources as you can while moving early game.

- Listen for chests.

- Where you drop determines your chances of survival and quality of loot.

- Building is key (Still working on that).

- Never touch the F1-F4 keys unless you're a masochist. Always use Q to build.

- I suck at CQB

- I suck at shooting people

- I suck at watching my back

- I suck during mid game.

- I'm good at hiding.

I blame part of this on the player base as even in midst fight with/against Thanos, you’ll always be in a free for all with the people that should be helping you take down Thanos. I’d say make it 99v1, but make it a free for all when the gauntlet is available to take

It’s just nothing but greed as half of the players in the game parachute until the glove spawns in and all go for it at once. Honestly the mode would be better if it just chose someone at random at the beginning and just went from there.

But for the most part, it’s an LTM people, save the sweat for solos and just have some fun for once.

Ok let me start out with the most important aspect first of all, how Epic would make money. The idea I saw a while ago was that for each win you get 1 ""ticket"" and you can save them up and spend them in a separate shop. While this would still be cool, I figured it would be more realistic for Epic to be on board if people still had to purchase the items. So, what if you unlocked the skins in this shop based on how many wins you have (ie. You need 25 wins to purchase this item and 50 to purchase this one)? Even if someone wasn't inclined to buy any other items in the game, they would still probably buy V-bucks to purchase the best Victory Shop item they could get just to show off and have pride in their number of wins.

Imagine being able to show off a skin that was actually difficult to get, or near impossible for some players based on how hard it is for them to get wins. Personally I have ~450 wins, so I made the scale of items from 0-500 wins required with 50 wins in between each item, but they could basically do any numbers they want. I also imagine the skins to all be pretty intimidating, but I don't really mind what would actually get added.

(disclaimer: im not a graphic designer, these are the best representations I could find)

Epic nerfed him before the majority of the player base even got a chance to play the LTM

Players should be running in fear from him, not pushing towards him for the easy kill while he is immobilized by his own jump

He should be OP enough to where players will work together to kill him, instead of hunting each other, because they know there is no other way to defeat him

His power stone attack should do more damage and his jump should take less time to charge, maybe even add a new defensive ability for him

As of now, it is easier to get kills in this mode as a normal player and it feels as if the potential of a boss in fortnite was missed, I really hope Epic can fix it

I mean the spread is totally random so technically it should still work even if I shoot at the edge of the cone of fire, but aiming at the middle provides are higher chance of those pellets hitting. 

I want to be hitting those dead center shots, so give us a crosshair that's just dead center. I don't want to ""clip"" them with one pellet, so **I don't need a crosshair to tell me that if I fire, I will clip them with one pellet.** The crosshair at the moment just provides useless information.

Alternatively just change to a consistent pellet spread. 

Or you know, why the does a shotgun need a **2.5x crit multiplier?** So a gun that has a spread so large you could aim at someones foot and be rewarded with a 2.5x crit multiplier, how does that make sense? 

Earlier today I hit someone from directly above them for a 79 damage headshot, they look up and hit a 125\+ headshot on me. I'm directly above him the only thing he should be able to hit is my feet?

Epic, when are you going to reward us, your regular mode Fortnite players who demand interesting weapons/items.

Give us the Jetpack, the Telenade, or at minimum the fixed Guided Rocket Launcher!  Don't allow main Fortnite to become stale!!  LTM players come and go.  We are Fortnites backbone!!",FortNiteBR

Come critique me girls and boys!,"So I got Fortnite BR early season 3, after my colleague twisted my arm. I think I'm relatively OK at video games but the above would suggest otherwise!

My routine is to fly into the woods, open the boxes then run to the brick dog, followed by the house to the north with the wooden tower if I have time. Then provided the circle is on the coast hug the coast (so noone sneaks up on me) whilst slowly moving onwards with the circle.

I can get myself to top 10 the majority of the time, top 4 if I have a decent load out and a wee bit of luck and out of the 600 games I'd say I've been top two about 20. But I just can't get the win. If I sneak up on them, they turn and blast me. If I build above them they just aim up and blast me, if I try to snipe them they just get me first. I love this game but the downheartedness of being killed 600+ times with nothing to show kind of blows! So any tips, hints and criticism please gang.

That kind of turned into a rant, apologies! ",FortNiteBR

I love getting that solo victory when I fight the last person in open ground and not some stupid whack a mole sniper battle from fort to fort. When playing squads, my buddies build and yell at me for when I don't but I see them as instant targets building their towers on houses and stuff. I usually wait in the house they built on top of and attack the players trying to flank or take down my teams towers. Something very satisfying hiding in the house waiting to pounce.

I feel like no matter what I try to learn from my previous loss it just gets countered in the next. 

Specifically I can’t seem to win any of my build battles even if I’m a better builder than the other guy. It always turns into a cycle:

Death 1: the guy is a better builder than me, is able to get twice as high as I am and peek shot me while I’m trying to catch up.

Death 2: I’m the better builder, but at some point the guy disappears while I keep the high ground and destroys the bottom, I fall to my death.

Death 3: I run into another better builder, so I try the destroy the bottom strat. He ends up guessing where I am, falls and lands a one pump on his way down before I can figure out where he is landing.

Death 4: I’m the better builder, he goes to the bottom to destroy, I try to guess where he is to pump him, I guessed wrong and he’s hiding around a different corner, one pumps me.

And the cycle just continues... I really don’t understand what I’m doing wrong, I just get straight countered at everything I do.

I tried to take the last few days off thinking it would reset me, but I am experiencing the same thing today.

Is anyone else stuck in a vicious cycle of losses like I am? I just really wish I knew what I was doing wrong.",FortNiteBR

So some players are jumping out the battle bus late and waiting for the gauntlet to come down and then diving to the gauntlet. I think this is kinda a bad way to play this mode and I think that the fun in it is everyone running over to the gauntlet and fighting over it. Because you don't know where the gauntlet will land people from all across the map go to one area to get it and kill whoever did get it. 

Unfortunately this method means that as soon as it lands, people already have it and this fight to get the gauntlet doesn't occur and instead people are killing each other and being destroyed by the premature Thanos.. (xD)

Thanos is meant to be the big bad OP monster that he is. Epic did Thanos the way he should've been done.

However I don't think it should still be an all on all for the rest of the players. 

There is no way to work as a team to kill Thanos if everyone else is also trying to kill you. 

Every time I go in to try and kill Thanos, I focus on him, as you should. I don't try to shoot the other players who are also trying to kill him and the ones focused on him don't tend to try and kill me either. 

But then you have these little weasels sitting out the back just trying to kill people when they're distracted by T-dawg. 

Now I'm not saying they don't have a right to do so, because this is the way Epic chose to have the game mode.

However, I do think the mode could have been a lot better if this wasn't the case. As this promotes defensive play, sitting in a bush or a building will almost always net you a top 10 here. But going in on Thanos and trying to kill him, which is the point of the mode imo will almost always result in death. 

My proposal? Whilst someone has the gauntlet (is Thanos), it becomes an X v 1. X being the number of players remaining. 
Whilst no one is in control of the gauntlet (Thanos is dead), it goes back to an all on all. Until someone picks it up again. 

This would promote teamwork and aggressive play. 
Obviously Thanos would need to be balanced to these changes but I feel like this change would make this mode a lot more fun. 

As to me, fun should be the main priority of any LTM, and currently this one is not. ",FortNiteBR

I found this disappointing since it was such a unique mode and really felt like winning as thanos or killing him to win would have defintely deserved some form of...something at least.

*My opinion -* Either way SUPER fun mode had a blast and killed 8 people so hey! I would say he is pretty balance but that was because I was fighting at shift shafts and that made it difficult for thanos to get hits.

*Abilities - *The gravity jump(no idea it's name)is pretty awesome! The sound effects are great and the mini into *Nice job epic!* ,Tied in with the leap smash to transport and assault it's plus his lazer of infinite but *immobile* death. He's pretty fun.

*Tips - *The best advice I can give when playing is keep to the high ground,You are very vulnerable against rocket assaults,The Grabity jump has a charge time so you can't spam it and leap all over the place.his laser does okay damage,Defintely situational since his main form of attack (for me anyway) was getting high ground,scouting and leap smashing. *BUT REMEMBER,YOU MAY FEEL LIKE A GOD...BUT YOU ARE NOT...SO PICK YOUR FIGHTS WISELY* 

Helpful tip-you can hold down the leap smash longer than the sound which makes you silent after the max charge time,Good for getting high ground scouting and leaping once you spot a target :D",FortNiteBR

I have never been a fan of the whole superhero thing but I know some people love it so I see why they would want to incorporate it somehow. But this game mode is beyond boring and was very poorly thought out. It almost feels as if it was rushed  because Marvel offered a fat check if they could release it ASAP. 

Not only that the game mode is extremely boring, but it is just a beyond obvious marketing ploy and I don’t understand why more people aren’t calling Epic out for that. This is equivalent, if not worse, of getting pop up ads on mobile games, it’s kind of frustrating. To top it all off, if you plan on playing the LTM, you have to completely ditch your friends.

Instead, I propose a 99 Vs 1 idea.","In IW almost everyone in the galaxy is working together to take down (he who shall not be named). Every hero, anti hero, and even some villains are coming together to take down the mad titan. When I heard about this new mode I originally thought it would be team oriented, with a group of players trying to take down a insanely overpowered dude. 

Instead we have a regular solo mode with legendary weapon spawns and one player who is stronger then everyone else. That's it. Meaning for a large portion of the map, it's just regular Fortnite. 

Some players may like this, but as someone who loves the story of IW, the notion of everyone banding together to take down the most powerful being in the galaxy is way WAY more interesting and fun then what we have now. 

Is this seriously all Epic came up with for this game mode? You've been given the keys to the castle and you make a LTM which is basically a worse version of all gold?


In my proposed mode, the 99 players would drop on the map and have 5 minutes to collect and gather resources and meet up to form groups and build bases. During this 5 minutes, s random player is chosen to be T-Dog, he spawns in on the island practicing his projectiles, jumps, punches and what not. After the 5 minutes, T-Dog teleports to the island like he does in the movie, and starts fucking shit up. The 99 other players have to use everything they can at there disposal to take him down. Of course T-Dog would have to be much more powerful, but I think that's kinda the point. Hes fucking (can't say the name cause of the stupid bot). I think this would be epic as hell. Everyone joining each other to take down one individual as he tears through the maps ranks would be a sight to behold.

Would this lead to some quick matches? Yes. Would this lead to some really epic moments with 20+ players charging T-Dog ala the trailers?absolutely. Epic has a golden opportunity to make a really cool mode, and I feel like it's being squandered by this decision to have it be solos.",FortNiteBR

I just successfully 1v1'd a Full Health ###### for the Victory Royale.  First of all, I'd like to say Holy shit, I'd accepted my fate once it was me and ######, but he's actually not that hard to beat, and here are the strategies I employed against him.  

- Launch Pads | ###### only has his ground pound move in the air. So, use that. Launchpad when he's close and shoot upwards at him when he tries to make his way over to you. 2 or more jump pads are ideal for this to bounce between (assuming he doesn't destroy them). This actually leads to my second point.  

- **KEEP YOUR FUCKING DISTANCE** | ###### becomes nearly unmanageable when he's point blank. Sure you can hit him with a pump or 2 to the head and reduce his health significantly, but know that he now has access to his full arsenal, and the odds are stacked against you. So make sure you stay away.  

- Watch out for other players | This may seem obvious but it had to be said. You're not the only one gunning for a shot at the boss' loot, and they will actively try to make sure you don't get it, so never tunnel vision on ######, and be aware of your surroundings, although this risk does decrease greatly when it's 5-2v1.  

- Building &gt; Laser | ######' only long-range ability is his laser. This can seem daunting at first, but if you can put up enough walls between you and him (2-3 seem sufficient in my cases), then the laser can't hurt you, and you can even get peek damage off.  

- Take advantage of the noobs | Now at this point, we're all noobs at ###### and I doubt anyone's had the chance to fight as him for more than 10 minutes, so use this to your advantage. Most ######' can't even aim their jumps correctly or sit in a corner to try and keep him, both of these, opportunities to deal damage.  

- If ###### has no shields, **PUSH** | This can't be stressed enough. ###### can regenerate shields upon kills, but he can't health, so any health damage you deal to him is permanent. This most likely means that the ###### will retreat when he takes this kind of damage, giving you breathing room and firing time.  

- Port-a-Forts are very valuable... as a distraction | If ###### sees a port a fort, he'll go for it. A slam into an occupied port a fort usually means the end for the poor guy inside. But when he pounds that unoccupied fort, he''l be vulnerable, so punish that.  

- (Maybe) Flank ###### and hit when he's using his abilities | I'm not so sure about this one, but on further inspection, it seems that ###### is locked in place when he uses any of his abilities. This means easy headshots with snipers for mega damage.  

And there you go! Happy hunting!

When someone becomes T, the voice lines are so insanely cheesy and sound like old CSGO callouts in terms of quality. It's really jarring and kind of laughable.

Also, in the patch notes:

Loot

Only Rare, Epic &amp; Legendary weapons will be spawned

Then why did I get a white burst, a white tac shotgun, and a white silenced smg?

There is a lot of potential that could be had with this mode, but it really feels like a lazy attempt for both companies to ride each other's success.

-Jumping over walls, stairs, floors
-Spine laggs
-after and after uptades its getting more broken
- players are laggin in distance, very hard to snipe
- jumping is sometimes very retarded
- PLEASE fix you sounds, when they are running close to me. One player were running behind me like 1 meter and i cant hear him. I am playing everythin at 1
- bring back ghostpiking, only thing that was funny
- Please change loot in squads. Its like you need to land tilted towers for loot only. In small Areas like Salty spring, even farms or Retail row (lol) we killed 2 team and we get really nothing.
- Create new shooting pattern for shotguns. Now it feels like i am playing Heartstone or Xcom2
- This game is very rng for loot. Not like in PUGB, where are big cities, Not like in h1Z1 where you have 4 types guns and 80% you have gun in 1 or 2 houses.   

Just epic please Release Hot fix uptades for fixing only the most broken bugs, thank you. 

The funnies part was that switching guns bug, was there over 2 weeks. :)
Again game changing bug.

Hypothetically a 1KD is average. I mean you would need to kill someone in order for them to die. So anything about a 1 is above average.
Wins do not determine skill. At all. It doesn’t matter if you have 50 or 500 wins. They mean nothing.
Everybody commenting on your stats are full of shit. If they haven’t posted their stats, don’t take what they say seriously. Duos and Squads are very easy to get carried in. You can go down, which is the equivalent of dying in solo, and get back up 50 times in a match and it will never count towards your deaths. Solos are 80% of the time the only stats that count.
So look at your stats yourself and you should be able to decide if you are a good player. ",FortNiteBR

0,RaiderJnr,1532934537,931xlv,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/931xlv/fortnite_im_done/,0,Fortnite... I'm done.,"I wouldn't say that I have been playing the game for a long time since it is only been out for a year. I've been playing since season 1 and earlier before there were any tabs in the menu except for the basics. I used to love this game but recently I have been playing the game less and less, I just don't feel it anymore. I know that in the short year Fortnite has changed, changed a lot and that isn't necessarily bad but I don't think that Epic really knows what they want the game to be, heck I even find Overwatch more playable. I know that Fortnite is still loved by millions but many like me just don't feel it anymore. My first issue is tilted towers, I still hate the place and I was really disappointed when the meteor hit dusty. In my opinion tilted makes the game way too boring in the mid game and believe me I don't hate tilted because I am bad and salty when I die if I land there, I would say I'm actually decent at the game but still hate the place... In general I hate the new guns that have been added lately, the new SMGs are way too OP and make the game way too easy it is the same thing with Overwatch, Overwatch died when Blizzard decided to add way too many (no skill required) heros wghich made the game unplayable and in my opinion Fortnite is following the footsteps of overwatch by adding guns that are extremely focused on getting along with the new players, the new players use the guns and are able to beat higher skilled players with no skill. It really pisses me off when I dive into a game, land salty, get some kills and get over run by a player with a drumgun and more health than me just to see that I was his first elimination. I really think that Fortnite has potential but I have had enough... I know the end might seem rushed but I have no intention on writing a hate speech on fortnite AND EDITING IT!",FortNiteBR

I was searching on youtube for tips on how to improve your aim in fortnite and i was shocked :(  you can use this device to plug keyboard and mouse to your console and it will not even appear on the screen that you are using kb/m ... sooo this is why a lot of streamers dont show their hands when they are playing and a lot of them has a great and quick aim + very fast building . ( it doesnt mean that everyone who can aim good and build very fast is using kb/m on console ) . From now on , i will not believe that everyone is using a controller lol. It is acctualy an advantage for them and i hope epic do something about it. I know they said they allow using it but also epic can put everyone using a kb/m on pc servers. ",FortNiteBR

So basically when me and this friend (i'll call Andy) meet up with other friends and talk about games and the question usually comes up. ""Who's better at fortnite?""  Andy always proceeds to say he's better than me which I always reply he's really not. Then Andy proceeds to exclaim that he always carries me or gets more kills in squads and duos. Which i'll admit he has done before but i've always told him i don't play my best in squads/duos and that i've carried him before and everyone's been carried once. My arguement was that you can only claim your better than someone in a game If you can beat them in a 1v1. We had 1v1 before in playground  asked for a 1v1 where I outplayed him and won 3-1. Each time I beat Andy He blamed something for losing his game Lagging,me using a bouncer, me scar spamming him. Despite what i said my other friends decided to side with  him being better which i don't get?

Tl;Dr: My friends believes that dropping more kills than me means he's better but being beat in a 1v1 doesn't mean anything?",FortNiteBR

Everyone just spams rockets, grabs easy kills and scoops up the dead guy's ammo, which consistently seems to drop at least 4 to 8 rockets after they die. This means, even shooting 12 rockets, you're bound to get a kill and then just scoop up the dead guy's ammo after you spammed him multiple times.

What is the point of nerfing the amount of rockets you can carry, but making the damage so insane that literally hitting a wall next to someone 25 feet away kills them? Then they pick up your rockets and go wreck everyone else.

The end game is someone with an RPG 3/4ths of the time. Sad. ",FortNiteBR

Building has become so easy to destroy, not to mention the building mechanics in console have become terrible when it comes to placing structures due to new bugs. You’ve introduced so many weapons that have high fire rates with large clips that now it’s all about who has the most ammo in one clip. Shotguns should be allowed to be used by themselves without being paired with another weapon. Pumps fire too slow and don’t offer enough damage output to compensate for the slow fire rate.  Heavys and Tacs are highly inconsistent with their damage despite all pellets connecting. Half the time these weapons don’t even render their correct body damage, and I have clips that show every single pellet of a heavy shotgun connected at point blank and it still did less than 40 damage. Building is weak, shotguns are weak, and now everyone needs to run an smg. You went from having multiple tactics, to only one again. Congrats, you’ve managed to piss off the majority of your fan base by supplying them with the shittiest meta in fortnite history. ",FortNiteBR

The heavy is also still really nasty if you can land those headshots. I think the shotgun paired with an smg is still really viable. But I find myself many times not needing to use my smg because I normally shoot and then build. This gives me enough time to get another shot off with my shotgun.

Yeah they don’t want you doing that anymore. 

The deagle is garbage now also, the falloff damage is wayyy too short and they need to remove the swap delay on it also. But they won’t because they don’t want people running around like ninja using double deagle.

Pump shotgun is dead and they won’t bring it back to life because they know the choobies will get absolutely wrecked by any of us.

If you are, it can still 2 shot you which is quicker than a P-90). The problem is when there is building. P-90 damage KILLS buildings, and shotguns can’t.

My brother and I would play duos all the time, and it was a blast. We weren’t good in the beginning of course, but we slowly became better at the game, and got a few wins. These were my favorite memories of FortNite, by far. 

However, at some point, around the middle of season 4, Fortnite interested me less and less. I was playing for a 5 hours a day, at least. So I decided to take a break. I played a few other games for a month or so, before deciding to try Fortnite out again. But when I came back, I just felt utterly and completely outmatched. Not only had my brother, who was previously on about the same level, surpassed me, but my kills dropped, I started dying much more often, and the players I encountered seemed to be much better.

Because people, like my brother, were playing for hours upon hours a day, they had grown in skill at an extremely high rate. I just couldn’t keep up. It seemed like every other person that killed me was a streamer. So I stopped. I still play the game occasionally, but I just don’t have much motivation anymore. I don’t have the want or desire to play this game for hours and hours a day, which I feel is needed to be at least above average. This skill gap between casual players and invested ones is far too high for my taste.

The tac and the silenced were fine as they were, they served their purpose as smgs. One of my favorite parts about the combat in this game is the shotgun fights, there was alot of different ways to outsmart your opponent, depending on what shotgun they were using. The tac, pump and heavy were extremely unique and played differently and had strengths and weaknesses. But as its been said many times before, every smg has the exact same tactic, ""just spray lol"". Its just straight up more fun to use shotguns, nothing is more satisfying than pumping someone and having all pellets hit the head. I don't get that same satisfaction when just spraying in the general direction of an enemy and knowing i'll get a kill if i keep spraying. I would like to use shotguns but they just simply cannot keep up with the smgs. If i have an extra slot i even use a shotgun as a SECONDARY to my smg. Smgs should be a secondary to a shotgun, not vice versa. TLDR: Bring back the tactical smg, vault all new smg.",FortNiteBR

Since the start of season 5 well even season 4 Epic has implemented changes to the game which would be great, if those changes were for the better of the game. But in my opinion as a skilled player, they are not. They have added a bunch of new things, again which is great but also not great at the same time. The things they have added such as the sticky grenade, stink bomb etc are cool an all but they give the new players a huge advantage and they keep the younger audience entertained in my opinion. I get Epic has to try to keep the largest possible player base and it kind of sucks that most people are of a younger age. But seriously though at the moment it feels building means nothing due to explosives being ridiculously overpowered, smg's ruining the build meta, and of course mini-guns.... Mini-guns just need to go, seriously. All these weapons that literally tear buildings down should either be gone or heavily nerfed against building because again IN MY OPINION they are ruining the flow of the game. 

Epic please, please can you give us maybe a playlist without some of these weapons? Or do something.

Stretched isn't something new that people are using because some streamers decided to use it. Many would. But does that make a difference? A lot of people seem salty at Myth and Tfue for using a more stretched resolution as they find it hard to watch. Lmao, grow a pair please.

This means I don't have directional hearing. So although I can hear footsteps, doors opening etc. and can roughly guess how far away sounds are, I have no clue in which direction to look.

When I saw in the 5.0 patch notes that the audio visualizer I'd seen on mobile was coming to console &amp; PC, I was very excited to finally level the playing field a bit by augmenting my hearing difficulty with a visual aid (as were my squad of all-deaf friends of varying levels of hearing, who have the same problem). I was concerned about sound effects being disabled but wanted to give it a try.

So on day 1 of season 5 I booted up and switched it on... only within minutes of starting the game to switch it back off again. I hadn't realised the extent to which sound effects were disabled. I can't hear *anything* and the audio visualizer just plays to my eyes as visual noise, because it's in a whole different context; it doesn't assist my hearing, but apparently intends to replace it.

It's a weird, alienating experience that feels like to me less like an accessibility feature than a full-blown ""deaf mode"". Perhaps other players whose level of hearing are worse than mine, or even have no hearing at all would appreciate it; but hearing isn't an on/off thing, it's a spectrum. And this is nothing like what I hoped for. I don't want my limitations to be reinforced by having sound completely switched off. My hearing is rubbish, but it's still somewhat useful, and I want to use it!

I have discussed with some of my ""hearing"" friends who play Fortnite, and they suggest the rationale could be that the audio visualizer had to be nerfed in some way because players who don't need it could use it for an advantage regardless to enhance their directional awareness. To which I respond: so what? It doesn't bother me if a Ninja or Myth wanted to use it, and chances are they wouldn't anyway just because the visualizer is so busy and they seem to manage without. More to the point, I feel deeply disappointed that apparently keeping the game ""fair"" is more important than providing accessibility tooling *without caveat* to players that would genuinely benefit most from it, like myself.

As one of my colleagues sardonically put it: ""We were so focused on not letting the disabled people beat us that we missed the point in helping them in the first place.""

Epic, please enable sound effects when the audio visualizer is enabled, and allow me to experience the game the same way everyone else is able to.",FortNiteBR

Still there are a few minor tweaks I’ve seen streamers/YouTubers/and posters on Reddit asking for so I’ve compiled them together and given my thoughts:

————

PISTOLS
——
Revolvers/Handcannons are another group of weapons I almost never see players use. They have a place - a midrange, high risk high reward weapon, but they just aren’t accurate enough/high enough damage at range to be worth using over an AR.

Solutions:
* Remove revolver/handcannon bloom - [make it a projectile](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90i8wq/remove_bloom_and_make_the_bullets_projectile_for/)
* Decrease damage fall off so it still has high damage at medium range

——
Dual Pistols are cool and all, but just as with crossbows and smoke bombs I can’t see where these fit or why we need them.

Solution:
* Vault the Dual Pistols

————

AR + BURST AR + SMG + DRUM GUN
——
Accuracy:

With the SMG buffs and the introduction of the Drum Gun ARs are much less valuable than they used to be. The Drum Gun especially begins to creep up into AR mid range territory. The Burst is even less useful due to lack of first shot accuracy for the second and third bullets.

Solutions:
* Slightly decrease AR bloom. This will allow ARs to shine a little better at mid range over SMGs/Drum Guns.
* Decrease Burst AR bloom even further to compensate for lack of first shot accuracy for second and third shots.

——
Structure Damage:

A big use for these guns is knocking down opponents’ structures. However, SMG/Drum Guns do far more DPS to structures:

Blue Drum Gun DPS to structures: 207
Blue SMG DPS to structures: 228
Blue AR DPS to structures: 181.5
Blue Burst DPS to structures: 157.5

This makes the ARs less viable, while the high structure damage from SMG/Drum Guns moves things a little too far towards “Just spam SMG, Lol” instead of “Just build, Lol”

Solutions:
* Decrease SMG/Drum Gun damage to structures
* Increase AR damage to structures
* Really increase Burst damage to structures. [Burst is just not worth picking up otherwise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/922it7/burst_assault_rifles_need_to_be_buffed/)

————

EDITING
——
One directional fully transparent editing was probably unfair, but now its actually harder to see while editing than while not editing. This means its both risky to edit down through your build to find a player you have high ground over, and risky to try to retake high ground. This results in less interesting build fights - players rely more on SMG spam/explosives, or turtling in a box at the bottom of a build.

Solutions:
* Make edits 50% opaque instead of fully opaque
* Allow both players to see through structures being edited

————

PUMP
——
Now that we have shotgun switching delays, the pump pull out delay to combat double pumping is not necessary and makes pumps less valuable than they probably should be.

Solution:
* Decrease pump pullout time. This combined with bidirectional transparent editing and decrease to SMG structure damage mentioned above will bring back quick interesting shotgun plays in build fights rather than SMG spam always being the best choice.
* *Maybe* increase damage so that headshots are 200 with blue pumps and heavy shotguns

————

EXPLOSIVES
——
Right now one explosion can take out an entire 1x1. Explosions should take out more than one wall, but probably not four walls and a ramp.

Solution:
* Slightly decrease blast radius so at least one wall is still standing after an explosion to a tower’s base, or limit to piercing two layers (i.e. first wall and ramp but not wall behind ramp).

————

STINK BOMBS
——
Stink Bombs are one of the best additions to the game to stop players from camping/turtling because they do damage through walls. However, it also has to be worth it to give up a slot to carry these.

Solutions:
* Increase stack size to 6. Since these spawn in 3s, having to drop the 6th is always sad :(
* Increase DPS slightly

————

STORM
——
Having the circle move into the storm for the final circles is probably a good mechanic, but it probably moves a little bit too fast. I keep getting wins where the last player dies to the storm or panics and falls to their death (we also saw this a lot in Week 2 of Summer Skirmish), which just isn’t an exciting way for the game to end.

Solution:
* For circles 7,8,9 move wait time back to 45s/30s/30s and increase shrink time instead.

————

HEAVY SNIPER
——
In matches where players don’t panic, most games still end with 3 players in 1x1s crouch peaking, and then the player closest to the circle wins.

Solution:
* Add that wall-piercing sniper that has rumored to be coming to the game which will make it riskier to just sit in your 1x1 and crouch peak, forcing more interesting finishes (should not be able to one shot though if the bullet has already broken through a wall).

————

GUIDED MISSILE
——
Going back to the problem of 1x1s, the guided missile adds another threat from above, and provides another way for players to attack from the low ground. However, after the upcoming readdition and nerf I think it will end up like the bush - only used by noobs and for memes. Its just too risky to use since it gives away your position and makes you unable to move.

Solution:
* Allow switching back and forth between missile view and player view. I want to fire a out a window, switch back and edit that window/build cover/protect myself/look for enemies, then switch back to controlling the missile, etc.
————

GAME MODES
——
A lot of people have assumed Epic has made some of these changes (SMG/explosive buffs, building/editing nerfs) for a reason - to decrease the skill gap so the game is more fun for new players. If this is the case I think this is a vailid concern, but I don’t think a lower skill gap is the right answer.

Solutions:
* Permanent Playground and 50v50 will help with this somewhat
* We probably need a permanent ranked solo mode accessible to players with X number of wins, with a ranking system that will actually attract the most competitive players to compete in, giving newer and intermediate players a little more space to improve.

————

Let me know what you all think, I’m interested to see where Epic takes all of this. I think with the above changes the game would be even more fun to both play and watch.",FortNiteBR

I feel the old meta was much more skilled, the was more of an incentive to be a better builder and get above someone so you could shotgun them.

The first problem is that the current meta is a mess and needs fixing. I personally enjoyed the shotgun meta however I can see how this can be problematical I think there was a stage where Smgs and shotguns were balanced however with recent buffs to smgs (despite the recent nerf) shotguns especially the pump are in need of a buff.

I also believe that they are now forcing new weapons and if anything weapons should be being removed rather than added as there is currently too many weapons and I also believe the map is beginning to become overcrowded 

Due to these constant updates there has been a noticeable increase in bugs especially on the console side and while I would definitely not call this game a broken mess there are quite a few issues that need resolving.

I also see the lack of new LTMs or even returning ones as very disappointing and while we have had playground I see that as a different thing all together rather than a LTM and would love to see new LTMs and high explosives and others return.

The way the pellets behave, I believe network conditions are a strong determining factor in the damage output of a shotgun shot. A pellet missing by a hair will affect the damage done by a shot drastically, so if someone's character is showing even the slightest bit different from where they truly are, your damage can be tanked (or maybe if you're lucky boosted). My theory could be off or there could be additional factors I'm not thinking of but there's definitely something making them behave very inconsistent and they need a massive rework before the game enters its full release. There's a problem when a pump to the sternum does 7 damage within a single block distance sometimes and other times does over 100 damage from 2+ blocks away.",FortNiteBR

Personally, I feel like this is an unfair advantage and shouldn't be in the game. The whole reason that console players have their own lobbies from PC players is because playing on PC is much easier. The extra buttons and mouse allow for more accurate aiming and faster building. This gives an advantage over anyone using a controller. While controller players are still very skilled at the game, I feel that it's an undeniable truth that PC players will simply be better due to the advantage that they have. 

If a PC player found an exploit that put he/she into console lobbies and dominated, we would call that person a cheater. While playing on PC provides many advantages, the main one is the fact that it uses a keyboard and mouse. Not only is this unfair to the rest of the PS4 players who use a controller, but it is also unfair to the rest of the community.

I feel that while Epic wold like to make the game accessible to all, they should at least place those players in the right lobbies. PS4 players with KBM should be placed into PC lobbies. I feel that this is slowly going to become a bigger issue over time as Fortnite increases the prize pool and has more tournaments.

What do you guys think? Should it be allowed in Fortnite? In tournaments? Should they stay in PS4 lobbies or PC?",FortNiteBR

Im aware this is a topic Epic games have taken note of and confirmed to be implemented into Fortnite's mechanics in the future but in the current meta a dedicated edit button for Ps4/XboxOne.

As we know, the new just spray lol strategy shreds buildings at close range and occasionally, you may need to box yourself in to put a couple of mini shields on or bandage up. 

Once this happens, it is almost impossible to edit yourself out of the box you are in in the face of a P90 or SMG because the reloads are so fast and there is a fast fire rate.

With a dedicated edit button on the other hand, a skilled console player with fast edits could still fight for high ground before the opponent gets a chance to shoot down walls again. 

There is many other needs for a dedicated edit button i know but the reason stated is very relevant with a very relevant scenario. 

Please Epic Games. We love you guys no homo lol more than you think so please try and put this a bit higher among the priority list as it is an inconvenience as much as it is vital considering how quickly buildings can be shot down.

(Dual pistols, however, I believe to be balanced) Not to mention building entirely shuts them down with their slower rate of fires. However, I believe building should be a counter measure to pistols so that is fine. My take on a pistol buff is not buffing the damage but rather tweaking accuracy and a few other things. Making them less RNG and more skill based rewarding skill weapons. My first suggestion is for normal pistols (Any pistol that isn’t a revolver, or hand cannon) is a bloom decrease. Since pistols shouldn’t have the dps of an Smg they should at least be more accurate. In the current meta, a white Suppressed SMG is better then a golden suppressed pistol, this is because the automatic firing weapon is more accurate then the pistol which has less damage output. Second of all I think Revolvers and Handcannons should have no bloom when aiming and should be strictly skill based weapons with zero bloom. This is mostly because building counters them so easily making it so hard to hit shots and even when there is a chance to make a shot it can be missed if the person using it moves an inch. Lastly, I think pistols should have a crit modifier of 2.5x the original damage output. (Not revolvers and hand cannons or Dual Pistols) This is to highly reward players for hitting critical shots with pistols or taking the high ground in build fights. These changes I believe will increase the skill gap of pistols and also make them stronger and a viable choice when battling in fortnite.",FortNiteBR

Less BS kills. Because the shotguns were less optimal at long range, you had 2 options. Rush with a shotgun or spray with AR. When someone rushes you with a shotgun, you’ll either see their building or hear their footsteps. That’s means you’ll know if someone is fighting you, as ARs time to kill is low and reactable, even if you get hit twice, you still have time to build up and pop a mini or two. If they rush you, you have time to counter build and enter a build battle. Now, the smg can kill you from a range where you can’t hear footsteps faster then a shotgun. At range, they will most likely take your shields and health. And that’s if you have 150-200 health. If your at 75-100, there is no hope for you.

What is fortnite meant to be? Fun? Competitive? Serious?


**Competitive mode: **
Fortnite has no competitive rank / mode to drive a winning/kills based game. This creates the idea that fornite is mainly directed towards fun casual play as it only offers 1 style of play (solo duo squad or LTM - showdown mentioned below).

However Epic has been pushing many tournaments lately, being the latest summer series with huge cash prize pools. Now this seems to go completely against the idea of fun casual play. If it was all for fun, that money would go straight towards **charity** (like Dr lupo etc etc have pushed in the past). They push this ethos of being the best at the game (great buildings , shooting etc , professional players) and you are reward cash prizes if you win.

These tournaments seem to normally take place within the public matchmaking system (most kills in 10 games etc) with is not achievable for the normal player. (we cannot setup a tournament like this easily)


**Showdown mode:**
This seems to be the only attempt for epic to create a competitive scene (beyond the streamers), this mode is solo only (but tournaments are often geared towards duo's or most kills etc).  I understand that this is a trail at a competitive scene, but This is the 2nd time they are doing it. Note that the mode is normally not available.

**Casual:**
Fortnite seems to be mainly geared towards this , simple game mechanics , easy to learn , ""anyone"" can win. 
Epic offers the battle pass for everyone to finish. The game offer very little incentive to win (only more XP).
With gamemode like playgrounds. We get offered other small games to play (car race) etc etc to have fun.

These are some point, I would like to know what you think.",FortNiteBR

Ok so the fat shield is great when you find it and only have 50 shield, but when else? The fat shield is one of the worst consumables to hold. To put it in perspective you can only stack 2 fat shields, that's only a total of 100 Shield. You can carry up to 10 Minis which equals up to 250 Shield. It isn't even a good idea to carry fat shields and mini shields because if you have minis it is much more advantageous to carry up to 15 band-aids which equals up to a total of up to 225 health, or 3 med-kits which equals up to 300 HP. With the slurp buffs there would be absolutely no reason to hold a fat shield over a slurp which you can also only hold 2 of.

All this being said, shouldn't it be understandable that the fat shield need a buff? Most reasonably in the form of being able to stack more, maybe up to 4 at a time?

However, none of them have gained any serious traction or discussion, so I thought I would make a detailed post about several bugs that have been happening since the Season 5 patch, please add any that you think I may have missed in the comments and help me gain some attention to these bugs. I love that Epic keeps adding new things to the game, like Paradise Palms and that it can't be easy debugging and testing when making such major changes to the game. But these issues have been going on for long enough that I would have thought they would have been fixed by now, so I believe this post is justified. Just a warning I play on Xbox so there may be some PS4 specific issues I'm not aware of.

1. Buildings not rendering in time.

This is by far the biggest issue, and was the main reason for creating this post. This was an issue when Tilted was first added to the game, it often took 10-20 seconds after landing before the building would render and you could enter it. Ever since this new patch it now happens EVERYWHERE. It use to be that you could just avoid Tilted and go somewhere else but now it happens at every city. Sometimes they render instantly, sometimes it's only a second or two after you land and sometimes I'll be standing in front of a house in retail for 30 seconds before it renders properly. I have tried uninstalling fortnite, as well as deleting my cache and nothing so far has helped. It happens to the majority of my group although some on the newest version of the Xbox says it is not a problem for them. This bug is the worst one by far, and is actually ruining the game for me ATM. I absolutely will not do the solo showdowns if there is a 90% my building just won't load for me, leaving me without a gun.

2. Enemies being invisible.

This is a new one for me since this patch. Enemies can now be invisible, except for the gun/pickaxe. I'll admit the first time I got killed by a floating pump was pretty funny, all my friends got a kick out of the clip. The tenth time? Eh, by then I was over it. You can still see the gun, and hear the footsteps but the player model is invisible. Also, sometimes rather than being invisible they are just translucent. I can see like a white outline of their skin but it's almost like trying to track a ghost in fights.

3. Loot being invisible. 

The first time I opened a chest and all that dropped was ammo and bandages I was really confused. But then I kept scanning right in front of the chest and realized there was an invisible hunting rifle. When your crosshair was over it the item name showed up, and you could still pick it up so if you are being observant this is not to big of an issue since most people know every chest drops 4 items. But oh wait, just yesterday I found out that this can happen with regular floor loot. My friends who was spectating me while dead saw a chug jug that didn't appear on my screen and kept asking me why i wasnt using it. Another very annoying glitch that has popped up recently.

4. Game freezes when seeing other players (and often just at random).

Anyone who watches Nickmercs is aware of this one. He said the PC guys referred to it as screen tearing but I'm not sure if that's correct. It has been in the game since the beginning but is now worst than ever. It seems to happen mostly when an opponent is right in your face, usually shotgun range. The screen will freeze for half a second, sometimes longer. This is perfect that it happens when an enemy is right in front you. Nothing better than lining up the pump headshot, having your screen freeze and then 2 seconds later hearing beedlebeedle. This also happens randomly, especially in major cities but I definitely notice it the most in fights.

There are other issues I could bring up like how awfully laggy 50 vs 50 is, why are players still allowed to use a XIM or even keyboard on console in general, player desync happens a hundred times more often than on PC and my Ping is 90ms even though I have great internet and run a wired connection but this post was more for the issues that have popped up since the last patch. If I missed any you would like to add please let me know in the comments. I know there are posts asking about some of these glitches already but none that are very detailed or have garnered any attention.

And if you get lucky and stay in the circle you can either rush Pleasant and kill someone that is still looting it, or you can go Haunted for extra loot.

Overall it's a good place if you want to win games, if you already know how to play mid game, since most of the game will be just running and it can be good for me that gets way too nervous during end game.

*You still can't hear people's footsteps or tiles being placed when they're building up to you until they're half a tile away.

*Firing weapons and especially harvesting metal *ARE SO LOUD MY EARS BLEED EVERY TIME*


And there's probably more I can't think of at the moment. I love the quality and effort that's being put in this game and most bugs seem to be fixed in a relatively short period of time, but the audio has been so bad for so long. I'd love to seem some fixes coming our way.

My suggestion is to add a channeled ability that can be used even while your gun is out, which allows you to turn an enemy structure into your own. For example if you set it to F, you have to hold down F on an enemy structure for approximately 3 seconds or so, and then the structure becomes yours and you can edit it. It would be a more reliable way of structure break/swapping that is kind of hard to pull off if your ping isn't good.",FortNiteBR

One of the more noticeable changes has to do with players thirsting each other.


When I first started playing this game players would down one another and then try to wipe the rest of the enemy team. More recently though players are so concerned about their ""stats"" that once someone gets a down its very common for them to just lock on and go for the kill. I've watched countless players do this to someone and then they quickly die because they weren't aware.


To fix this problem I suggest that a system already in game be improved. Once a player is in the DBNO mode they gain a short immunity. At this point in time that lasts about .5 seconds(ish). To reduce the amount of thirsting while not removing the option to do so the immune period should be extended. Somewhere between 1 and 2 seconds makes a lot of sense. This change would allow players to choose whether or not they want to kill a player after they go down while making it a little more risky for them to do so. Encouraging players to at least look around for a few seconds even if they really want to thirst that kill.


Overall a change like this would make sense since there is so much building and running around that happens in this game. Teammates would have more than a split second to save their friend and actually have time to wrap around that corner to finish whoever was being fought. This is a game designed around winning a Battle Royale not a game focused around how many kills a player can get during a win or loss. Even if killing is super fun &gt;:)",FortNiteBR

Beforehand, I used to win pretty consistently, but for the last couple weeks, I have only won two solo games. It's strange to me to see how much better I have become in the sense that I typically have between 4-7 kills by the time I make it to the top 10, but I often only place in the top 5 (and often losing to players with less than 2 or 3 kills). I have probably placed 2nd 10-15 times over the last 2 weeks and also in the Top 5 near 40-50 times.

In encounters, I will probably win 75-80% of them time and I feel confident engaging other players. Of course there are still small mistakes that I make, but it's frustrating to realize that I am better than I have ever been and now I lose even more often. It seems to be the opposite of what I expected would happen. 

I often die to silly things or even just pure luck by my opponents (spraying, or random shots, etc.). For example, I can't tell you how often I have fallen or accidentally crouch and therefore get stuck crouching while trying to focus on other aspects of me fighting or being shot at and therefore, ultimately leads to my death. There have been many moments when multiple people focus me (disengaging each other to do so) at the end for some reason as if I'm some shining beacon that will reward them for killing me. Basically, I have noticed that I die to many things that are often out of my realm of control and I rarely die to people who are actually skilled.

Honestly, I find that I enjoy the game less than I ever have due to me consistently losing. It's extremely frustrating for me to see how much I have improved over the last few months, but reap so little benefit from it. I'm starting to wonder if I will ever consistently get wins and therefore, unfortunately, I'm beginning to lose interest in the game.

Sometimes I get nervous once I reach the top 5 now and consistently losing has exacerbated that feeling. But often still, I am calm and focused but still screw up my wins.

I know this is strange, but really, I'm just happy to get this off my chest and admit to myself that I don't enjoy the game as much as I once did.

The ones who build strategically and fight via superior gun game.

And the ones who equip a shotgun, build like a spastic every time a butterfly flies next to them, continues building a massive ridiculous maze, and then gets a lucky shotgun hit every once in a while. 

When two of the first kind battle, it's a fun, exciting experience. 

When two of the second kind battle, it's a huge clusterfuck that boils down to two people hitting keys as fast as possible until one of them randomly gets a shot off that involves no skill at all. In fact, it's more chance-based than anything on who happens to build in the right direction.

When one of each kind meet, it usually results in the strategic gun player building a fort, trying to defend it, Bob the Builder ramps into it, and then either: A. The first player leaves, leaving Bob the Builder in his massive tower that he usually doesn't even notice his enemy is gone for at least a minute. Or B. Bob the Builder builds randomly, overwhelms the strategic player simply because instant building is incredibly overpowered, and the first player leaves a hole punched in his wall from his frustration. 

Building is an integral part of Fortnite. It always has been. But frankly, now that the game has dissolved into a huge button-spamming fest anytime a battle takes place, it's lost a lot of its allure for me.

A few months ago, building was a great way to build some cover, create a strong fort, and have an exciting firefight between two teams. It was used strategically to give yourself an advantage over your opponent and, when mixed with gun-skill, could be a really useful ally. The most people ever built was the occasional one by one tower or so. The firefights were actually FUN and exciting.

Now, building has simply become a ridiculous tactic involving chance, randomness, high sensitivities, and overwhelming your opponent by any means necessary. I refuse to believe there is any skill in placing ramps and walls as fast as possible with no idea where your opponent is until you happen to see them, then pop off a shotgun shot only to continue building. Playing like this is completely unexciting and involves no talent whatsoever. I absolutely hate it. 

The game simply is not fun anymore for people like me who prefer to not be a spastic builder. I don't even want to shoot at unsuspecting enemies because I know that, the second I do, there will be a dozen walls in front of me and twenty ramps coming towards me. It has completely ruined the game for me and turned into a messy shitshow of sweaty builders with no chance for people who refuse to give into that unrefined gaming style. 

I'm not asking for building to be taken out. It spices up the Battle Royale genre and, to be honest, having huge firefights between forts are some of my most fond recent gaming memories.

However, instant and unlimited placement is completely overpowered. Even with explosives, I have no chance against the builders unless I, too, whip out my blueprint and pull my triggers at complete random. 

Epic: this random, unskilled strategy is extremely frustrating and takes both the fun and skill out of the game. I have absolutely no desire to play anymore because all of my deaths come from this crap. Fix your game PLEASE. Introducing new weapons is great and all, but honestly, when everything is only a clusterfuck of walls and ramps and there is literally no gun skill or strategy whatsoever, it kind of defeats the purpose. 

Stop the ridiculous building. Take the game back to what it was a few months ago; a good balance between building and gunplay. Perhaps a cool down after ten tiles have been placed? Or slower build times? Remove builder pro? Or literally almost anything. 

The game just isn't fun anymore. I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way. Fortnite is by far the best Battle Royale I've ever played, but I'm stopping until all of my deaths no longer come from unskilled building spastics.

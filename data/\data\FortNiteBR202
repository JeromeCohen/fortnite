Grenades/launchers and clingers are trash when dealing with building spam and SMGs/Minis can't damage fast enough to break through the never ending walls.

Am I missing something here? How do you deal with builders now?


OR

Is explosive damage bugged? Each time i pelt their structures with tons of grenades and don't get a single tick of damage. I know remote explosives has the same bug briefly, where if the structure was damaged then the player wouldn't take any damage themselves. ",FortNiteBR

I know this is extremely controversial but I just needed to get this out. So far this season has been by far my least favorite season. The skill gap has in my opinion been decreasing for some time now and the removal of bounce pads and the double shotgun method still not being in the game has been a big downer. Last season however the saving graces were the rifts, and a whole new awesome corner of the map that replaced that, let's be honest, pretty shitty area. However this season there are hardly any map changes and the one major map change gets boring after the first 50 ish times you go considering it is just loot lake house with a tornado around it. I understand that it is moving and it may activate some hopefully cooler and more substantial map changes later but for right now it really isn't all that special and the novelty wears off of being able to fly around. Last season rifts were a huge game changer and well done by Epic to add them in as well as the ATK's, another huge feature. This season however, I feel Epic have been lazy adding in Shadow Stones which aren't really that game changing but more comedic. I'm not complaining about the stones though as they can be fun and thats what this game is supposed to be, I am complaining about the fact that the Shadow Stones have been disabled at the start of the season for longer than they haven't been. Epic have 70 days to create a new season and all they do is create a house on a tornado, add pets, and failed to implement a new novelty feature into the game. I know this will get downvotes but I needed to get this out.",FortNiteBR

What I mean by ‘joke’ item is that it’s an item that has a very cartoon-y or unrealistic nature but can still be used competitively. I have a few ideas if you’d like to check them out:

**Roulette Revolver**- A revolver that has a single bullet in its cylinder, which deals a massive amount of damage (think double barrel shotgun) when shot, but when an empty slot is shot a tiny flag pops out of the muzzle that reads ‘BANG!’. Each shot (whether it being an actual bullet or not) takes ammunition, and the weapon has a cool-down rate similar to that of a hand cannon. This weapon is rare/legendary.

**Punch Gun**- A gun that consists of a boxing glove with spikes attached to a spring. This weapon has extremely low range, but deals a massive amount of damage (again, think double barrel). Much like a grappler, this weapon does not use ammo but is instead restricted to a set amount of uses (5-10 maybe?). This weapon has a cool down rate similar to the grappler, and is of legendary rarity.

**Laughing Gas**- This is a throwable grenade that works similar to the stink bomb crossed with mechanics of the boogie bomb, in which it casts a field of smoke that makes opponents laugh hysterically, disabling their weapon until they leave the field. This item is rare.

**Faux Bro** (title is a WIP lmao)- This item is simply a placeable cardboard cutout that looks like a player, fooling those from afar. This could be used to either find the direction of which a shot is coming from, or drawing players to a current position. This item is of blue rarity. (While I doubt this one would work due to over stimulating servers, I think it would be a fun item nonetheless).

Hope you guys like :)",FortNiteBR

I find that although I’m not a godly builder, I have a ton of success beating these aggressive players who build above me and then get confused that I didn’t build battle with them so they assume I’m a scared little noob. So they drop and try to shoot me or place a trap. 

This technique I use to draw them out from their highground usually works 90% of the time and I kill them! More times than not I don’t even take any damage. 

I find that a crazy build battle can end with being shot down (especially if I don’t have bounce pads, launch pads, shockwaves, etc.)

I don’t really see many people adopting this play style that I use. Perhaps people are used to seeing noobs do something strange in a panic. But I calculate my every move in order to get the drop on them.

I’m sure I have many recordings of this in action. I should upload some clips. 

But for the purpose of discussion, what do you think of this play style? Any additional input or comments?

And I’m sure you’re probably thinking “oh how cute” or “how wholesome” but what if I told you that the kid is either a liar or a scammer and lies about being scammed!

First off he was lying about being scammed referring to this post where he claimed to have been :https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9k6pb8/i_thought_the_fortnite_community_was_doing/?st=JMP34APK&amp;sh=9e8cf1e7 

And then proved wrong by the “scammer” in this post: https://twitter.com/ghxstofficial/status/1046429857029263360?s=21

So from this you can probably tell that the “kid” isn’t trustworthy at all.



Also he is either a liar or a scammer as shown by this: https://twitter.com/aidanwheeler871/status/1046152679670591488?s=21

Epic games has done a lot of things right, but one thing that I believe they have overlooked is the amount and the impact of “instant thirsting”... while the community could easily end their pact to immediately finish off downed opponents, they have proven to me that no matter how kind I am to the defenseless downed opponent, they will not change their own ways...
I know that a lot of people will just say that I need to “hit my shots”, but I just feel like in most situations it is completely unnecessary to thirst a helpless opponent.  Your team either wins or loses, rarely do the teams back up and have another go at it... so in that case what’s the point?  If your already sitting comfortable in terms of ammo and materials then it makes no sense to ruin the other team’s game. And I’m not suggesting that players have to wait for their AWOL knocked player to bleed out.  All I am proposing is for a downed player to be protected(invincible) for a short amount of time. This could be anywhere from 5-15 seconds. I am so tired of all of the occasions where my teammate or myself was just a second too late to save the other. Probably 10-20% of my duo or squad games end early because either me or my teammate didn’t come out of the fight alive. Which usually results in a disappointing suicide or a long stretch of spectating.  There could be exceptions to this rule as well. For example this rule could only apply to players inside the safe zone, because players wouldn’t usually have enough time to wait out an elimination in the storm. And if this feature does make it in game, then it can be adjusted as time goes on. Epic has shown over and over again that they’re not afraid to mix things up. My only hope is that this idea is brought up to the creators of Fortnite Battle Royale, and that they consider the potential benefits of adding such a feature. I realize I may be alone in this stance, but I’m asking anyone that would like to see this change made to Fortnite to help bring this post to the attention of the amazing fortnite community by sharing it with friends and fellow gamers.",FortNiteBR

Every gun in game should have its own unique meaning and use. In my oppinion there is no point of picking up any bold action sniper rifle other than heavy. So you should pick up heavy 100% of the time... The thing that bothers me is that heavy is OP compared to other snipers. My idea is to nerfing it to deal no special headshot damage - to be the same as the whole body 150/157. Then you would have to consider am I taking regular bolt and outskill the oponent by headshoting them or am I taking heavy with heavy body damage and structure damage but no one shot 200hp kill.

I was thinking though that these kind of tournaments are only geared towards the top players and are not really accessible to the majority of the player base.
The solo showdown was of course open to anyone, but it getting any rewards was virtually impossibile.

I am also strongly against the creation of a ranked system as I think it would split the player base and ruin the fun for most players.

So my suggestion is to have a tournament that has progressive tiers of difficulty with different rewards (in the format of the solo showdown for instance). For example:

Tier 1: tournament open to everybody, - you get a small cosmetic reward for participating and completing all the matches

Tier 2: only the top 50% of the previous tier get access to the tournament - you get a better cosmetic reward

Tier 3: only the top 25% get into the tournament - better rewards 

And so on until only the best are left.
It could be a seasonal tournament.

This way you can actually work towards some rewards that mean something in-game and you can have an understanding of how well you perform against other players...

It’s just a small idea, but I would love to participate in something like this!

I’ve always thought the concept of digital cosmetics was stupid, but really I just got it to have the motivation of challenges. Without challenges the game honestly just feels rather repetitive to me, and I often times now only find myself playing to get my daily, or on thursdays to do challenges.

50v50 is a great mode for players who aren’t very good to get some more relaxed game time. What this causes though, is that if they venture into regular mode the majority of players will stomp them. So they give it a try and decide it’s no fun so go back to 50v50. So the problem is that by having a mode for lower skilled players, it’s basically locking them out of enjoying normal modes due to the lack of others at equal skill level playing it.

It would be interesting to see what the regular modes would look like if 50v50 wasn’t there every now and then. Possibly have it only every 2nd week or disable it one week a month etc.",FortNiteBR

Nah, but seriously. Instead of fixing the game and improving its gameplay mechanics, EPIC instead diverts its resources to tweaking maps and creating cosmetics in order to do as little as possible while still raking in millions. Ask yourself- wouldn't it have been refreshing if the rifts instead teleported everyone to a new world, possibly with different physics and different skinned/style weapons? Seeinf ass how all they know how to do is make skins, redisgning some buildings and guns couldnt be too hard. It seems as though each season is just different assets and locations, and a new item if we're lucky, instead of a whole new experience. Its sad people pour so much money into a game simply to ""look cool"". Why doesnt EPIC use the money we spend to make our experience better?

Life  is less hectic now and this game looks so fun. I watch the summer/fall  skirmish streams and I don't even play lol. its intense as hell, making  up for the flaw I saw in PUBG which is was how damn slow it felt as a  game.

My main question is whether there's  a ranking system of sorts by now? so I'll go into game with ""newer""  players such as myself, at level 6. I know the people in Skirmish are  professionals, but its really insane to see how far building has come,  and I know I can't compete anything like that. Other new players would  let me last long enough in games to actually get some experience..  rather than dropping and dying immediately every single game.

Any other noob PC players want a friend? :D We can squad up and be terrible together. I have a mic.

Well most of you may have noticed the massive floating island held up by Kevin at loot lake. If you haven't, then i would presume you haven't logged on this season. Anyway this 'floating island' is starting to move just like Kevin the cube did and following the tradition of Kevin, it needs a new name!

#How to give it a name

Everyone come up with your ideas below, Make submission names as parent comments. Off topic parent comments and discussion will be removed. The most up-voted comment is what the sub shall name the floating island. The moderators will address the island as whatever the sub votes on in the future. We also expect with the combined power of the sub to also address it by that name too and make it stick!

This mini contest will run for about a day. and this thread will be updated with the winner.

Since they have to actually land on your box to kill you, any quick and smart editor can easily manipulate the fighting ground and get quick shots on you like it’s whack a mole but they’re the mole with a fucking shotgun, or they can drop you into a trap.

Epic has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.,"It’s been a little over a month now that my account has been banned. To fill everyone in this all started when for some odd reason their website would not let me enable 2FA and I was trying to get it enabled since I’ve spent well over $1k and countless days on this game. So I decided to email them and tell them the site was messing up for me and wouldn’t let me enable it and a week went by with no reply. I then send them another email saying I haven’t received a reply. They respond the next day with an email and I quote “Your account has been disabled and will no longer function with any Epic Games' products or services due to account sharing, which violates our EULA/TOS.

Epic Games support is unable to re-enable your account upon request. For more information about our EULA and TOS please visit the links below:
EULA: https://www.epicgames.com/toshttps://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/eula
TOS: https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/tos

Regards,”

At this point I’m furious because now my account is banned and I’m unable to log in. I send emails asking them how did I account share because I’ve only logged in to my account on my phone and my PS4 and my brothers PS4. Needless to say they give me the standard reply of they can’t release any information they used to determine I was account sharing. I try to reply to explain to them my situation about how my parents are separated and I visit my dad in Canada sometimes and I have logged in on my brothers PlayStation maybe twice but I haven’t even logged in to it in months. They don’t reply and then a few days ago I try again to email and explain to them how I haven’t broken the TOS and etc and I get the same standard response. I’ve spent so much money and time on this account. I’ve played since the beginning and this is how they treat a loyal customer that always spent money on their product? This is absolutely ridiculous and I emailed them today explaining to them how I would like to resolve this issue without having to go through my lawyer and all of that unnecessary bs but once again they have stopped responding and I feel their is nothing else I can do. Epic really needs to spend a percentage of the billions they make on an actual customer service department. This is unacceptable. You can’t just ban an account from someone for nothing, especially someone who has spent so much time and money and expect them to be ok with it. Sorry for the structure of this post, I’m just furious and now I have to spend even more energy on this talking to lawyers and all. I don’t have time anymore to be dealing with this because I have a newborn and a full time job. This was my hobby and then all of this happened. Any suggestions?",FortNiteBR

Why is sgtw a good idea?
-The possibilities of new POI’s are endless. This post itself was inspired by [this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9jvpn6/opinion_i_think_it_would_be_pretty_cool_to_have_a/?st=JMNPAKD9&amp;sh=dfbdc4bc). I also have seen a lot of other suggestions like beaches, harbors, shipwrecks and more.

-It’s more realistic for the ground to meet the water naturally than have a 70m drop everywhere.

-Gameplay improvements including endgame storm circles that now. When over the water, are really hard and dumb.

-It looks better.



How could stgw be implemented?

-You add a bit of ground around the map that lowers to the ocean. 

No but seriously.
-There could be some problems. Like for example: people camping in the water. This can thankfully be avoided by making players ”drown” when going out too far.

I can’t come up with more problems. Coding or gameplay. There sure are some i don’t understand. But they sure aren’t impossible to defeat.

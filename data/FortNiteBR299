https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBRF86IB5MQ

If you don't know what aimpunch is, basically means when you are aiming and you get hit, your crosshair will move as a consequence of getting hit. 

I believe there is no accuracy penalty for getting hit but the animation of crosshair moving truly makes using scoped or thermal AR and sniping at close range really hard and it's such an unnecessary thing for fortnite.

First things first i'm retarted
Think computers die when they restarted
And I have an extra chromosome
So I have a disease that is unknown I suppose
If you wanna be a degenerate
Punch yourself in the face repeatedly
Lots of blood, lots of hurt, lots of fists
Handicapped, somethin' worth no collage on my list
Takin' all the dumb classes never chase that
Brainwash like were bringin' torture chambers back
Bringin' in the docters, where they at?
Brain fluids drainin' you should taste that!

She's so stupid!
But you already know
If you didn't
Then you should die in a hole
Shes a dummy!
She got dropped on her head!
Remember that or burn in the ashes with the dead

I said baby I'm handicapped I thought that you knew this
Can't stand the fakers and honest, the truth is
I am half retarted, my school I departed
Swagger on stupid, can't take no department
Better get my pills on the time, If they don't work, then i'll die
That's so important gotta get that line right on rewind
Better get my pills on the time, If they don't work, then i'll die
Just can't worry 'bout no fakers, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me who dat? Who dat?
That is handicapped?
Got the wheelchair while I walk, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that degenerate, put my name in bold
I am retarted with some extra chromosomes

Really, Iggy?
You attention whore!
You say you're retarted
When you are even more
You are dumber
Than what you say!
Your real IQ is negative 3!

Trash degenerates
They are the scum of society!
Make then all die!
Run em' all over with my truck

Keep on makin' then die
They don't deserve life and they should go cry
Retards, kill them all off

I came over to Fortnite from CS, having played that pretty much exclusively since 1.4/1.6. I thought transitioning to Fortnite would be a little easier, but i'm on the struggle bus, i've only been playing since week 3 of this season but have pretty much only been playing squads with friends and find that i'm not improving as quickly as i'd like. I log anywhere from 3-5 hours, 4/5 times a week. More @ weekends. 

Is there a way that people got better even if painful, perhaps doing solo's in titled to work on aim/close encounters. Or if i'm playing squads be the aggressor rather than 1x1 trying to locate / long distance shoot. Or convince my squad we should be dropping in more populated area's, rather than outskirting (to be fair, been doing this intentionally for exp as live longer = more exp = lvl 80). 

The thing i struggle with the most, is locating enemies in / around a build battle and maintaining this knowledge whilst i'm doing my own builds. I also seem to focus in quite a lot, whilst attempting to knock someone, often getting knocked myself elsewhere. Does this come with more hours/experience? 

I know the playground is coming out soon, so i'll be practicing a bunch on there. 

FWIW, fairly sure my ability to improve isn't prohibited by my keybinds/headset/keyboard/mouse. I have a pretty alright setup, and i love my keybinds, which incidentally, are pretty much identical to how SypherPK has recently changed his (at least build wise - Q and 2 side mouse buttons )

I gots a feeling the response will be ""play more"", and i know i'll improve if i just keep playing, i'd just like to escalate the speed should anyone have any good tips! Thanks in advance :) ",FortNiteBR

Nobody likes being against them, everyone has fun using them. 

If it were up to me I would remove RPG's from chests altogether and put them in loot drops only. I can't even tell you how many times I've been insta-killed by some skillful player named Barry because he looted an RPG in his first chest he opened. 

I'm not a fan of being 1-shot by someone who takes zero pointblank damage and can run about and continue their game. I'm talking about early game here when you have next to no materials so building a wall isn't possible unless you've deforested the Congo Rainforest because well.. harvesting is a joke now.

Perhaps add a detonate distance? So instead of just point blanking people with them they have to travel at least 15 metres before being able to detonate on a surface.. Being point blanked by an RPG is ludicrous especially if I die and the user doesn't take any damage. Can't tell you how many times I've spectated someone after they've done that and they're still at full health.

Countering RPG's is easy if you have the materials; but early game, who has materials unless you're focusing on harvesting over getting a weapon/chest immediately and no-one does that.

So, it's kinda like this: 

1) On around 1/4 of my games I manage to reach top 3;

2) Early game  I play mostly passively (I avoid dropping on heavy populated areas and when I do, I don't go full-on-agressive);

3) Mid and late-game I do a mixture of both aggressive and passively (depending on position, health + shield, etc);

4) I win around 75&amp;#37; of my shotgun duels but I wouldn't honestly consider myself good at it, generally I just have a better position or high ground (I build a lot defensively during shotgun fights sometimes);

5) My general set  up is: AR + Shotgun + Sniper + Explosive (both impulse and rocketlauncher fit this category) + something to heal, pref. small shields since they're a 10 pack and really fast to use;

6) Generally I reach mid-game with 2-3 kills and end-game with 4-7 kills;

7) On top 10 generally I kill 2-3 of them but I tend to pay attention to see if there's an ""alpha predator"" and try to kill him while he's busy rushing someone.

8) Very often I end up 1v1 against someone who is very defensive, isn't that good at shooting and has a terrible position in comparisson to mine, so I do whatever I do when that happens mid-game: push against him, which 90&amp;#37; of the times seems to go very well (I manage to get some of his health, get a better position and lose no health) but... ;

9) Then I fuck-up (ALWAYS) and die. E.g. I miss 4 shotgun shots in a row; he is in open air and I try to AR him with the crosshair right on his head/chest and miss 15 shots in a row and he just ARs me down; when I drop I lose the high ground and he just builds a ramp and shoots me down, etc. 

I've had a few solo wins, but they were during a time when I played much poorly (2-4 kills per game, slow building, bad at pushing, etc). So I feel like I'm missing something, but I can't really figure it out. 

So, I'd appreciate some tips!

So I've been considering the idea of streaming (fortnite, obvs) but there's so many questions left unanswered by the petty idea of 'research'. 

First off though, let's get a few things clear: 
-I'm a ps4 console player with a pretty nazely voice, my family is Jewish and we talk with our noses!
-I'm a PS4 console player...is that already enough said?
-I do have 200+ mins [209 to be exact] 
-I think I'm a nice, funny guy, Idk. 
-I got the Merry Maurder which is the best skin IMO
- I play for fun but I'm competitive i.e. I like to challenge myself and compete on a pro level
- streaming for me would be almost be no monetary benefit, I want to do it to get my name out there, to create a community of people that support and help me develop my fortnite skills. I wouldn't be in it for the money at all, but for the fun and experience! 

Now, I have some difficulties that arise such as: how do I grow and develop? Do I stream on twitch or YouTube or what? Should I even do it?

So my heart and ears goes to you guys, tell me what you think. Be critical, I can take it! Thank you guys for getting this far.

I just feel like It is dissapointing to not get max because you are busy or have work and I feel like many otber people are in the same boat. 
I suggest maybe changing the challenge to level up 80 times instead so people who are really busy could still get it next season rather than having to reach level 80 this season. Or you could make it so the challenge stays next season but you still need to reach level 80. Either way I feel like their needs to be an opportunity for busy people to actually have a chance to reach level 80, weather thats changing the challenge or adding a double xp LTM. Also the amount of xp needed is also absurd considering reaching level 60 means you are only halfway xp wise to reaching level 80.",FortNiteBR

I've been gaming for 25+ years, i feel like i'm a pretty avid gamer at this point, i've tried all kinds of genres of vid games, obviously i'm better at some than others, but my personal preference is games that take several layers of skill involving outsmarting your opponents, honing your weapon like spread/recoil, tactical positioning, and generally just outsmarting your opponents. 

When it comes to shooters, i feel like i can hold my own, in games like call of duty, i find myself doing games like 50-4 with a fairly high KDR on average. But when i play fortnite, it feels like 25 years of gaming just got thrown out the window, i feel like im shooting a gun for the first time in video game.

I'm trying to understand the mechanics of this game, for me, its important in a shooter to never blow your cover by engaging in a shootout you know you either won't win, or to blow your cover and position. I see people bunnyhopping with shotguns almost everywhere with zero consideration to exposing their location, the building of structures is another giveaway...but, it seems to not matter, every time i encounter someone for a gun fight, i just get rekt, like hard. i think i've managed to maybe kill off two people before and that even felt like a huge uphill struggle.

I applaud fortnite as a game for being original, in a market so saturated where almost everything has seemingly been done already, its nice to see something different, though it's kicking my ass hard. either i'm not figuring out the mechanics properly or i just seriously suck.",FortNiteBR

Some things to remember: You need to stay alive for 14 minutes to get 238 survival time XP.  Top 10 gives you 100 placement XP. Getting a kill will give you another 50 XP. So, with the 120% bonus you’re getting 744 XP for just surviving 14 mins and making top 10, or 854 XP if you get an elimination as well. 

1. Deploy your glider around the middle of the bus path.

2. Wait for the first circle to form a little over a minute. 

3. Go in the middle of the circle, find a big tree to crouch on top of, or even safer, a bush that covers your whole body. 90% of the time the second circle will be on you, and the third one is usually pretty close! Be aware of any players around you, don’t rush to go to the next circle, there’s lots of time to get to it safely.

4. Sit and wait, go AFK, do what you gotta do.

5. Wait until you’re in top 10, then feel free to try and get a kill or even win the game if you get lucky enough. 

I’ve been doing this at work on my iPhone and have gotten from level 68 to 76 in no time. It’s crazy that you get more XP this way than getting a few kills and placing 11th or worse.

I understand that you can do things faster on keyboard and mouse but editing on console is just to damn slow. When u edit on console you have to HOLD the B or O (depending on what console you are playing on) for at least half a second. This may not sound like a lot but if ur editing many pieces back to back or when u need to edit quickly it takes to long. They need to make it so you don’t have to hold a button to edit. But they would have to change the button to do so. I think they should make it so u push the right joystick down because you cant crouch when u have your building out anyways so it would not interfere with previous buttons. This would also be a good idea because you could edit without taking your hand off the joystick making it even faster. ,FortNiteBR

Console players shouldn’t have to be forced to use K+M on their consoles. If people want to use K+M leave it restricted to cross platform or make them queue with PC players but stop letting them play against controller users which are the vast majority of players on console.

Lowered the pump damage, along with changing other damages around on other weapons through other nerfs. 

They've added so many unnecessary and dumb weapons, watering down the chests and floor spawns. Did we really need two new AR's, a stink bomb, and leave other weapons in there like the Hand Cannon and Minigun. They should seriously vault some weapons. 

Reduced floor mats from 30 to 20, just like why? What difference does it make?  

Reduced mats you get from certain types of trees and objects. (i.e. Pine Trees used to be 30-40, now they are 15-25.) Again why? 

Reduced the amount of XP you got for Kills, and rewarded more for time survived.

Reduced Loot Llama mats from 500 of each type to 200, along with taking away the rocket ammo from them.

Reduced the max ammo of Rockets you can hold, now a max of 12 plus the rocket in the chamber, so really it's 13.

Added the Jetpack and Shopping Cart. They both just made the game childish and stupid. Thank God they removed the Jetpack earlier this month. I know they re-added the Shopping Carts back today. 

Experimented with Traps going from originally 125 damage, then down to 75, and now they are at 150 damage. 

There are probably some others that I am missing, but the point is that they are lowering the skill that it takes to loot, build, and play the game. 

When does the catering end? When the Loot Llama is taken out? When there are just terrible weapons in the game? When there is no desire to loot anything or get mats? When there is no more building? It might sound stupid, but you can't count anything out. Did you think that there was going to be a change to max rocket ammo? Probably not, but there has been. 

Now I hear they might reverse their decision to increase build times, mess with the building meta in other ways, and some people here are suggesting to lower the max amount of mats. Like what? 

If they reduce the mats max from 2997 to 1500 (500 each), then sorry, they should just remove building from the game at that point, because then where and when does it stop? Does it then get reduced to 250, then to 100. See what I am saying. 

They are messing around with what used to be such a perfect game. They should stop catering towards terrible people, and reverse some of these terrible decisions. ",FortNiteBR

It would give a 'warning' similar to how it has a message about the storm eye shrinking. It would say something like 'storm eye moving _____ (North South East or West). Obviously, this limits people to move around, encouraging a non-camping playstyle. After 4-5 movements, the storm eye would stay put and shrink as normal.

I think nerfing resources to 666 or something is a moderately good idea for a few reasons.

Me personally I am a player who likes to go for high kill games, I usually drop at Tilted, and if its not tilted I'm going pleasant or retail most of the time.  Coming out of those areas, Tilted especially you don't get a lot of resources.  Players like me will often come out of there with 6 or 7 kills, but little resources.  Then, a player who prefers to just go for wins who dropped Moisty or Waling and is maxed out on resources but only has maybe 1 or 2 kills will simply outbuild me and kill me.  This is quite frustrating.

As a general statement I really hate ""building bitches"" players who just keep building and building to the fucking sky and never stop to have a gunfight.  I like building battles and building is what makes Fortnite unique but players who just keep on going and going and going really piss me off.  At some point you have to stop running and just shoot it out.  My main argument in this scenerio is that its gotten a lot harder to get high kill games because every gunfight is prolonged.  A gun fight that would have ended in 45 seconds now goes on for a minute and a half and sometimes even a whole two and a half minutes.  This wastes valuable time that could be spent going out and killing other players.  It doesn't even take a tremendous amount of skill to do this, all you have to do is start building first and keep mashing buttons on builder pro or keybinds if you use pc.  I think nerfing the amount of resources you can hold will force players to be more smart with this.  I understand build battling to the sky at endgame, at end game its totally justified but if you do it like midgame you're just a bitch.  Shoot it the fuck out at a certain point.

The other thing is I don't think this will necessarily help the noobs in Fortnite. In some ways it will make it harder.  A noob will waste his resources and have none at end game.  A smart player will use them wisely.

Building is what makes Fortnite unique but having every gunfight turn into a giant building battle is just obnoxious.  IMO, building in Fortnite should exist to as a support to guns in most gunfights, building should only be the key to clutching the win in those crucial end game last 10 people fights.  

But that's just my opinion please let me know what you think I would love to hear everyone else's opinions on this whether you agree with me or not",FortNiteBR

I think the primary concern of Epic right now has a lot to do with new player retention. I've played this game heavily for about 8 months now and it is absolutely unbelievable how much this game has evolved since then, especially in the context of player's skill levels and the tactics they use. 

3 months ago you barely saw a build fight, today you're in a build fight with almost every other player. And when build fights started to happen more often, I died a lot, like a lot a lot. It was uncomfortable, I froze as soon as someone got on top of me, it was a bit discouraging. 

But then, I researched how to counter it, I watched pros, i learned what I was doing wrong and I evolved. Something that I have NEVER had to do in another game prior to this. And you know what happened? I got better! And when I won my first build fight it was like winning my first game, I was so proud of myself I actually let out a cheer. 

So, to finally get to my point here; I can see now that there is A LOT that has been implemented into this game since a lot of us have started playing. And the voices we aren't hearing are the new guys that haven't caught the Fortnite bug yet because they can't make it longer than 5 minutes into a game so they quit. 
I know what that's like, we all do. Imagine your entire Fortnite experience is a 5 minute game ending with some John Wick building overtop of you and double pumping you back to the loading screen. And if he's anything like me he's tea bagging the shit out of you while you're exiting the match. That doesn't sound like a very good experience to me, and it would make me seek out other forms of entertainment. Especially if it happens **every single game**. 

**Therefore I think we have gotten to the point where a Skilled Base Matchmaking is necessary BUT ONLY if it means materials are buffed back to a respectable yield. **

It is very clear that the building META is what this game was supposed to evolve into but the learning curve to get there is too difficult for new players and they are getting discouraged and quitting. But continuing to nerf some of the main components of the game to stimulate new player retention is not the answer. In fact continuing down this road will effectively kill the player base. 

Initially I was against SBMM but if nerfing the META is the alternative then I'm all for it. I don't find the end game build fights to be stale. In fact, the end game still gets my adrenaline pumping to this day and I have over 150 wins. 

But a transparent SBMM that doesn't force you to be stuck in a certain tier and even gives the player the option to toggle it on/off should be implemented. 

Especially if it means we get to have materials buffed **at least** to what they were prior to the nerf. 

Sincerely,

Your core player base. 

P.S. don't pull a Bungie: Destiny 2 and cater to the casual gamer to stimulate new player growth, it's a slippery slope. 😘

TLDR: Time to implement SBMM.

A lot of us bought the battle pass not so long after release to get the pass and we were on the grind to complete it. Generally takes 75 - 150 hours to complete when tiering up was 2 challenges a day and leveling up. I believe I bought the pass with about 45-50 days when the original time was about 60ish days. I played quite a bit, did my challenges consistently and leveled up as much as possible. I've even got 50+ wins that season and I saw progression of skill level from season 1 and I couldn't hit the mark. I've played the game consistently with many of my friends and we were almost at the Knight and their we're talks that it was nearly impossible to get their because we were about 10 days late. We would have to play every single day and level up twice. I'm not saying bring back the battle pass so everyone can complete it but I think they should bring it back for a limited amount of time because I wasn't going to spend additional v bucks to hit tier 70.  This battle pass currently I'm level 75 with all the challenges done and only at tier 93 and the season is coming close to ending. It really says a lot.

What's left is 27 tiers that need to be done through daily challenges (22 if you got the bonus 5 and 2 more if you bought the bonus 25 tier pass). Because the amount of daily challenges you get has been reduced to 1, to get to tier 100 you need to spend 54 days doing daily challenges (most likely 44 days for the usual battle pass players who get a bonus 5 tiers, and, at least, 2 for the people who bought 25). Remember, this is if you not only did every single weekly challenge, but also made it to season level 100.

To me, this seems a bit too strict and grindy, especially since we already paid for the pass itself. I understand Epic Games needs to make money, but requiring players who are already paying to grind, at most, for 54 days seems a bit harsh. I personally think we should get the two daily challenges back while keeping everything else, which would reduce the amount of days to tier 100 by half, which is still a bit grindy, but far more reachable for players.

If this post is too long for you to read most of, don’t comment on it.

Seriously, what’s the point of these? If I’m being honest, they kinda hurt the game more than help it. There’s a reason some people turn these into ramps before playing a game. I don’t care about the tricks and exploits it brings to the table. The majority generally don’t use them.

If I was to think of everything somewhat game changing that the unedited pyramid was good for, I’d say it gives more defense to the top of your base and it helps you cross water without getting sniped. That’s it really. They aren’t really even major things.

The removal of the pyramid wouldn’t be something I’d really have any hate for at all. It would be the end of accidentally building pyramids everywhere when getting shot at. It’s a problem that occasionally affects console players like me (though not very often). PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ISN’T THE ONLY REASON I MADE THIS POST! I KNOW HOW BUILDING WORKS IN A DECENT WAY. I AM NOT REALLY TOO BAD AT THIS GAME EITHER. I even killed someone who seemed good when I was a noob without any wins or skins because of those pyramids. I shouldn’t of been able to kill him.

Sure, the pyramid/trap trick that originated here would be a lot harder, if not impossible, but I’ve never been able to pull it off anyways; assumably a lot of others fail to as well. Not a single person I’ve encountered has tried to do it to me, so it wouldn’t really change much if pyramids were to be removed. This would also make looking through pyramids impossible, but that’s an exploit anyways, and wasn’t intended by any means.

Please keep in mind that I’m not targeting specific people with this thread who have done tricks with the pyramid. They are minor things, and aren’t really doing much to the game.

Now I know people are gonna get out their pitchforks and scream about how I should go play PUBG and building is what makes this game good, but calm down for a minute. 

The current meta right now is that two people see each other, they start battling for high ground, as soon as one gives up high ground, the other takes advantage of it and kills their opponent. This forces both players to keep building up in a spiral that either consumes ridiculous amounts of materials or kills both of them eventually. If anything this just encourages farming mats for half the game, and camping in order to avoid getting in these build fights. 

I can see the point Epic is trying to make, use building tactically to create cover and defend yourself, I hardly think their original intention was to have people use building to cross an entire field to shotgun someone or use building to fight to the sky.

What I think should happen is to add a material cap, mate 600 or 500, then buff material gathering rates, so people can’t use up 2000 materials in one go, and have actual think about their building instead of screeching and spamming stairs and walls everywhere. With buffed gathering rates people can still have materials to fight, just not be able to carry the goddamn Statue of Liberty wherever they go.

The grind is awful. At least in my opinion. I say this because frankly, to get to level 80. Let's just do some simple math.

Let's just say you generally don't win most of your matches, as I would assume many can say; and let us assume that you only get about 5 kills per match and end up in the top 20s. That's about 650 XP give or take at max XP boost in solos.

The total XP you need to get to Omega is 532,250. Just divide that by our average match. That is over 818 games. Just to get Omega. That's not even counting:

 - When you land and instantly die.
 - When you get fewer kills than average.
 - If you have less than the Max Battle Pass.

But conversely, it is also not counting:

 - If you get more kills
 - If you place higher
 - If you win

------------------------

As much as I love Fortnite, being forced to play 818 games, where I at least have to survive to the top 20s and get 5 kills minimum (by the way I'm basing that off my most recent matches), that is stressful and frankly unenjoyable. Any match that I don't meet that criteria means that's basically a null match.

The grind is harsh and unfair. I am not one that is generally against grinding, just as long as it isn't forced and it is manageable by a normal human being. This isn't.

--------------------

Omega is locked behind three walls.

 - Battle Pass
 - Tier 100
 - Level 80

Unless you meet these requirements, you're not getting the full skin, and in my eyes, there is no point in wearing something that isn't complete. The skin is also placed on a deadline, this forces players to grind out the XP for fear of not receiving the skin.

Thus it is forced grind.

It isn't manageable by a normal human being either as 818 games, assuming that each one is a mere 15 minutes at best. That equates to 12,270 minutes or 204.5 hours. Or 8.5 days.

Eight and a half days straight of Fortnite with no breaks at all. No food, no bathroom, no job, nothing. And each of those games you HAVE to get five kills and you HAVE to be placed in the top 20s just to get that aforementioned 650 XP just for the match to count, otherwise, it's another match you have to do later on, which means another 15 minutes.

Factoring in sleep and work, assuming sleep is a healthy eight and work a standard 9 to 5. That becomes 332.5 hours or 41.5 days assuming you're playing for the remaining eight hours of your day. That is spending every waking moment outside of sleep and work on Fortnite.

Now I suck at math so there's a fair chance all this is wrong as hell. But to need 5 kills a match, and place in the top 20, over 818 times is flat out absurd.

-------------------------------

I get that we all like exclusivity and the idea that not everyone will get the chance to become a part of the cool kids club, with purple glowy Omegas, but I think that this kind of grind is frankly ridiculous and flat out awful.",FortNiteBR

The part I wanna focus on is ""(typically takes 75 to 150 hours of play)"". This is true for the most part but you need level 80 to unlock the chest piece of the Omega skin, and this takes way more than 150 hours ([Proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8j2m92/fortnite_season_4_xp_chart/)).

This is very hard to achieve for people with a full time job and/or kids etc. Now the missing the chest piece (and the ability to change the lights) doesn't seem like that big of a deal but (for me at least) not having the chest piece makes the skin look unfinished and not nice.

I am all for having a hard goal in the game like this, but they probably should have done it another way. Would love to hear other people their opinion on this.

Another complaint is ""i dont have enough time,"" which i frankly think is a stupid argument. Once again, it is a reward for constantly grinding, therefore not everyone can earn it.

Building is the driving force of this game’s skill gap. When this game started, the “Material Economy” was balanced because most of the player base didn’t build and those that did were winning and gaining a surplus of mats after every kill, because people would just be carrying a crap ton of materials so you would leave a fight with more materials then you had. fast forward to now and when you come into contact with someone of roughly equal skill, you leave the fight with no materials and now you can’t utilize the skill gap AND now that the pump headshot damage is below 200 you have ZERO reliable options to deal with the people who push you after your fights. Everyone knows how to build and are on the same skill level which is causing the problem, Epic is trying to widen the range of the skill gap by making building harder and If they do right it will make the game a lot more enjoyable. 

If you disagree with any of my points tell me why! I want to have a discussion!

Two people were fighting below my base. I jumped down and the last guy was healing up with a window in the middle of his wall. I hit him with the tac shotgun twice while he had low health and then he pulls out a sniper and no scopes me from 4 meters through a window to get the win. I had full health and shield as well. This happened during season 2 so it was a quick swap to the sniper so I had not time to get another shot off. 

Comment a specific situation in which you were extremely unlucky. I think it would be interesting to read people’s most unlucky moments. :)

And that is usually the worse builder in the fight, 4. They added turbo building, this helps alot of casuals and decent players to build 2x quicker than what they are capable of, it also helps pro's build quicker aswell in some situations. So far they have reduced the skill cap by atleast 40&amp;#37;. In my opinion they haven't really had a good patch since the build through everything patch, the game was in its prime on season 2, and have been going downhill from there, I know the way its going is making the good players lose interest and the popular streamers aren't enjoying the game as much as they did before because they have to chop mats all the time to be able to play their playstyle. I think they should either add Blitz 1.0 to be a extra game mode that never goes away, or just revert everything back to season 2 and add the build through everthing patch. Blitz v1.0 was the best LTM they have had it was so enjoyable to play and that was what every other decent player thought aswell, though Blitz v2.0 was worthless because they reduced the mats from v1.0 to me this is really obvious that people want MORE mats not LESS. Fortnite is unique because of its building so let us build.

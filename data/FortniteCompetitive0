I haven't tried it out in 1v1s or Arena yet, but in pubs I was doing things I normally don't do as consistently.

I just don't know if that loss of FOV is worth it or not, let alone certain building mechanics take an extra whip of the mouse that you might not be used to.",FortniteCompetitive

Its stupid that console players complain about there FPS drops and blame Epic for doing making it that way when they can’t do anything to help you and I find more stupid that Epic actually listens to them in competitive when console players make up 0% of competitive players and even more stupid they probably or did cause PC players to lose stretched res and have no FOV slider due to console players saying it’s a “uNfAiR aDvANTAGE”for PC players who are on computers.Epic should release console tournaments for the love of god",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Ballatw, competitive fortnite caster and analytical/educational content creator. You might have seen me on the last 10 weeks of the Fortnite World Cup Online Open broadcasts, or ESL Katowice, Secret Skirmish... or maybe one of my videos.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing/watching/studying competitive fortnite since right before Ninja Vegas, and have been hooked ever since then. I grew out of this subreddit right here during Summer Skirmish to become a caster for Epic and other organizations. My goals are simple, break the misconception that competitive fortnite is not viewer friendly, and to build a community that loves learning and diving deep into the depths that this game has. Obviously I want to be the best at what I do - so if you have any feedback, from casting, to VOD Reviews or any of my content, I'd be let me hear it, either here or in DMs! I credit this subreddit specifically with helping me get my feet off the ground - so I am forever grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as what I'm currently working on, I'm not travelling for at least a little while, which should be good and allow me to focus on my own content - which means more reddit posts :D I'm going to launch two new educational shows, which I think you guys will like, since it's very interaction heavy. You'll still see VOD reviews and hopefully I can crank out some short-form content. You can also find me on the Hotline FN Podcast every Thursday at 8PM EST - which is going awesome, tomorrow we have yungCalculator on, who just had his AMA and qualified for world cup in week 10.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally - i'll be casting BOOM CUP #2 with Shyowager tomorrow at 1PM EST.

Let's do this thing, AMA!

*This game reminds me a lot of a game I used to play called GunZ The Duel. It was an incredibly fun game and I have not played a game as enjoyable since, until Fortnite. Fortnite has the potential to be the greatest game of all time and even in the rough state it is in right now it probably already holds that claim. I love this game and I find it really fun even though lately I have been finding it very hard to play for long sessions. Playing this game for too long now feels like doing a job and I think it is because of the current issues and imbalances festering in the game. I am not a great player. I am just a regular guy that plays on his PS4 on the families living room TV to the constant complaints and distractions of everyone telling me I play too much, or I should be doing something better with my time (even though I only play an hour or two a day). I have made it into champions league and felt great accomplishment for a time, only to have that sense of joy stripped into a lethargy about the state of the game. For some reason I felt compelled to make this write-up about the game, possibly in an effort to help save the game I love...*

*I have written this from the POV of an Epic released patch note in an attempt to lead by example or somehow fake it until we make it.*

# 1V1 and 2V2 Playlists:

* Materials will be capped at 1500 to prioritize skill as well as building efficiency.
* Infinite ammo. Fall damage on. Build with metal.
* Both ranked and casual playlists available.
* Three weapon picks from a list of standardized weapon choices in ranked mode: AR, drum gun, suppressed submachine gun, tactical shotgun, combat shotgun, pump shotgun. Players will also get 2 mini shields to allow for counterplay.
* Elo point system with 10 divisions. Five placement matches before entering your most suitable division.
* Leaderboard that shows the top 100 performers as well as a scrolling banner on the bottom of the 1v1 lobby screen that shows the current longest win streak in your division as well as in the highest division i.e., “Faze Sway is on a 13 game winning streak in division 1”, “SypherPK has just ended Faze Sway’s 13 game win streak in division 1”.
* Winning against a higher skilled player than you gives you more Elo points compared to if you won against a weaker player and vice versa.
* Relegation is possible but there is a relegation safety cushion of 100 points.
* 1v1 matches are best of 5.
* 1v1 tournaments for a chance to win prizes will take place each season.
* The match will start in the typical creative 1v1 setup with a barrier between the enemy players. The barrier will fall, and players will become invulnerable for the first 5 seconds to allow players to run past each other without surprise attacks and begin cranking 90’s or dab should they so desire.
* These are the division point breakdowns:

Div1: 2000+

Div2: 1750-2000

Div3:1500-1750

Div4:1250-1500

Div5:1000-1250

Div6:750-1000

Div7:500-750

Div8: 250- 500

Div9: 100-250

Div10: 0-100

* Each division has a reward cape with the division colors and emblem emblazoned on the back. Pickaxing an opponent will add a special division based “etch” onto your pickaxe giving you a subtle flex.

\*\*\*

# Ballers:

* The boost ability of ballers has been nerfed so that boost takes 25% longer to regenerate. Ballers will also now lose 5 health for every wall they break. This is in line with our philosophy of ensuring players do not get a free ride to end game placement points because they landed on a baller.
* Stinks will now do damage to players in ballers. Ballers and other vehicles will not be able to pick up loot by rolling/driving over it.
* A bug has been fixed where players were sometimes unable to enter ballers.
* Players are now able to immediately exit from vehicles, but we have implemented a 2 second animation to enter vehicles. This should mitigate players exiting ballers to take pot shots and hiding in their ballers again.
* A bug has been fixed where players were unable to rearrange their inventory upon entering a baller.

\*\*\*

# Building/ editing:

* Edit boxes no longer need to be fully selected but instead players have the option to “draw” a pattern that will select the corresponding edit. For example: Drawing an L anywhere on the edit display will automatically edit a lower right triangle. Drawing a straight horizontal line will edit the top row. Drawing a sideways V will edit the top 2 rows. Drawing a dot to the right of your character will edit a right window, a dot to the left will result in a left window. Drawing an upside-down U will edit an arch. These motions/swipe patterns do not need to be large or exaggerated. You also have the option to map custom edit binds by “teaching” the game A.I. what a door edit looks like by repeating the edit 20 times for the game to “learn” the motion/swipe pattern needed to create that door edit. The motion could be anything you want as long as you reproduce a similar motion enough times for the game to “learn” that THAT motion corresponds to THAT specific edit.
* You are now able to build anywhere but building over walls and other structures does not destroy structures. Instead, if editing your structure, the structure underneath will block your view until it is broken. In these cases, the original structure will take visual precedence, but should that structure be broken than your structure/wall will appear. If the overlaid structure is hollow in some areas, those areas will be filled out by your structure/wall. This will resolve the problem of instinctively building cover when getting shot only to realize building is restricted in that area and therefore taking unnecessary damage.
* **Players will now have the option to hold to edit (release to confirm edit) along with the option to one press reset (without the need to separately confirm reset).\***
* **An issue with editing where swiping over a square too fast causes the edit to not register has been fixed. Editing will now feel smooth regardless of your FPS. This issue was evident when selecting the squares and quickly confirming the edit led to a triangle edit turning into a door edit or simply not registering altogether.\***
* **Players will now be able to edit builds based on crosshair placement and not character position or the type of build that was last placed. This should fix players being unable to edit walls because they last placed a floor. This should also fix players being unable to double edit a floor and pyramid upon getting too close to the pyramid.\***
* Players are now able to build near umbrellas and reboot vans.
* Edit delay/ fatigue was accidentally introduced during season 7 and has been removed. Continuous edits should feel more seamless and fluid now.
* First piece build delay has been reverted back to 0.05.
* Players will no longer be able to place builds through another players builds. Players will no longer be able to critical hit builds through other builds.
* Builds that are clipped by a player making them “phase-able” now appear to be transparent.
* Door edits will no longer initially appear to be transparent. This was mistakenly done during our efforts to optimize end game building.
* Buildings will now completely render BEFORE players land.
* **The new trap placement system has been revamped due to extreme inconsistencies. We thank all the players that provided feedback in helping us solve these issues. The current method using default key binds required us to press ""Circle"" or ""B"" to switch to build mode, then ""Square"" or ""X"" to select traps, THEN ""Square"" or ""X"" again to PLACE the trap. This is obviously redundant and requires an extra press and usually results in people spamming place trap until the trap finally places. It doesn't help that there seems to be long delays between ""build mode"" and ""trap mode"". Instead of that traps will now be placed using just one press of ""Square"" or ""X"". So, the series of presses would be ""build mode bind"" then ""place trap bind"". There is no reason that ""trap mode"" should be its own mode that requires a separate press to activate. What about if you want to switch between traps? Simply bind a directional key or even a touchpad swipe gesture on dual shock 4's to cycle through your traps while in any mode, ""combat"" or ""build"" mode.**
* **Before sequence to place a trap: ""build mode bind"", ""select trap bind"", (""cycle through traps if needed bind can only be accessed at this stage""), then finally you can ""place trap bind"".**
* **After sequence to place a trap: ""cycle through traps whenever you want (in any mode) using touchpad swipes or another bind"", ""build mode bind"" ""place trap bind"". Simple, easy, intuitive.**
* **\*\*The crosshair is now the be-all, end-all when it comes to building, editing and placing traps.\*\*Where the crosshair points will be where the action takes place. Players will now be able to place a trap on an interior wall of their box whilst standing outside looking through a window edit.**
* **The main thing to note here is that players do not need an outline template of a trap in much the same way that they did not need an outline template of any other form of build. Hence, we released the ""build immediately"" feature. For consistency, the same treatment has been given to traps and they are now treated as a ""fifth build"" instead of a completely separate mode that requires a sluggishly intermediate key press to activate. A setting has also been added that allows players to toggle off building walls and floors with traps.\***
* Controller players now have the option to swap guns using key press binds that they can set. The default key press binds on PS4 are: R1 = first slot, L1 = second slot, R1, R1 = third slot, L1, L1 = fourth slot, L1 + R1 = fifth slot

\*\*\*

# Competitive:

* Players in a queue that extends past the tournament deadline are now guaranteed to join a match so long as they remain in queue. A “last call” notification will be implemented where all players attempting to queue into one last match are reminded within 5 minutes from tournament end to join a queue.
* Arena Trios will be implemented into the game BEFORE the trio tournament in order to allow players to practice and prepare for the trio tournament.

Game:

* We are testing ways to minimize early game RNG and improve competitive integrity. Players will now spawn with a grey pistol BUT players will also be granted invulnerability while jumping from the bus until they reach the ground.
* **Players are now able to hold to place builds before entering build mode whereas before it would only work with walls.\***
* **Controller players are now able to overlap presses. for example: players are now able to hold down the ramp button and tap the wall button to place a protective wall hanging from the end of each ramp, whereas before a player would need to tap ramp, let go of ramp, tap wall, tap ramp, etc.. This way, the action of releasing the ramp bind automatically places a wall since you were holding the wall bind down the entire time.\***
* Arena will now follow the same Elo system as the 1V1 and 2V2 playlist. There will be divisional rewards as well as a weekly leaderboard. In order to mitigate queue times, players will spawn in a pregame creative lobby where they will be able to split up and vote on competitive minigames to play while they wait. Ex: 32 person king of the castle in old Tilted Towers, 4v4 Mini BR, 16 player zone wars etc..
* Controller players will no longer be able to “L2 spam”. The ADS sequence will now ADS perfectly in the centre of the crosshair. This will mitigate L2 abuse where players with high FPS will “lock on” to enemy players.
* The grenade throw animation has been adjusted so that it ceases upon the grenade leaving your hand.
* Following our philosophy of allowing the players to see what is on their screen, we will no longer show game messages (storm closing, reboot card reminders etc...) in the middle of the screen but instead small graphics and short audio queues will replace them.
* **Players now have the option to turn off pre-edits.\***
* Players are now able to build over all parts of Loot Lake.
* Players are now able to shoot through and glide through tree leaves (no hitbox). Although landing in a tree “breaks your fall” and you take 50% of the fall damage that you would have taken otherwise. The hitbox of the actual tree (excluding leaves) has been reduced so that it just barely clips the interior wall of the branches and trunk.
* Edge camping a cornfield no longer grants vision to a player and players on the outside are now able to see players camping the edge of a cornfield.
* Respawn vans have been removed from all solo game modes.
* A free wall will now be placed atop the wall in the ground if the grounded wall is at least 50% (190 cm) BELOW the surface (previously 70%). The purpose of this fix was to ensure players did not take unnecessary damage due to walls being placed in the ground. Since the average Fortnite character is 185 cm and the height of a wall is 380 cm, we have found that walls should extend out of the ground at least 185 cm to ensure a character is fully protected.
* Rarity now represents both the rarity of the item in terms of spawn rate and the viability of the item/weapon in terms of effectiveness. Statistical studies have been done that may be counterintuitive to popular belief that indicate RNG is minimized when items on the low AND high end of the spectrum (in terms of strength and viability in the current meta) have LOWER spawn rates than average strength items/weapons.
* Trap damage has been reduced to 100 damage. We initially reduced trap damage to 75 in season 4 because we had data that revealed traps were too strong at 125 damage. After weeks of testing we realized traps were not viable at 75 damage and so we increased their damage to 150 completely forgetting the laws of transitivity. Because of this trap damage has been reduced to 100.
* Stink damage is no longer stackable. If a player throws multiple stinks the damage from both stinks will not overlap anymore. Areas where multiple stinks overlap will still do 5 damage per second. Stinks will now skip the first tick of damage to allow players time to react.
* **A pickaxe delay was introduced in season 4 to stop fast farming techniques. This delay did not work to prevent fast farming as players just found workarounds. Because of this we have chosen to remove the pickaxe delay in order to increase gameplay fluidity.\***
* Gun reload animations are now a tiny smidge longer than actual reload times. This will help prevent players from mistiming the reload and thinking their gun is ready to shoot. The number of bullets in your clip now appears in the top left corner of the weapon graphic to help players know if they need to reload any weapons.
* Ping-based matchmaking will be tested in an effort to diminish ping advantages within the game. During matchmaking lower ping players will be prioritized resulting in players with similar pings to be matched together.
* **Settings for console like shadows, textures, effects, view distance etc.. are now available in the settings.\***
* Separate build/ edit sensitivities for PC are now available in the settings to maintain consistency between platforms.
* Cross-platform lobbies now show the logo of the console/ PC along with a logo of either controller or Kb/M next to the players name.
* Players are now able to adjust different settings for custom lobbies including, storm surge, siphon, material caps, and farm rates.
* Players will no longer hitch/teleport straight to the ground after being shot down, but instead will fall in a smooth motion consistent with gravity and the laws of physics.
* Riding a zipline will no longer destroy builds in the path of the zipliner. The player will now be thrown off the zipline upon crashing into structures.
* Fully breaking trees will now grant bonus material equivalent to two additional critical hits.
* **The shield damage effect has been reverted due to players not being able to see the majority of the screen after getting shot. Shotgun particles and material break particles have also been minimized to improve visibility during box fights and other close-range engagements. From now on we will prioritize visibility over wall-break, shrapnel, shield, health and damage number related animations.\***
* Upon hearing complaints from many players experiencing motion sickness due to the default FOV, we have decided to add an FOV slider ranging from 90 – 110. This will allow players to find their optimal setting.
* A bug has been fixed where players spawn into a match with broken skin textures.
* Players will no longer be able to clog the kill feed by spamming spectate.
* There is no longer a discrepancy between crouch delay/responsiveness when repair is also bound to the same crouch button. There is also no longer a delay upon picking up items when hold to swap is on. This was caused by the “release to pick up” feature being applied to all instances of picking up items, not just hold to swap items.
* A bug has been fixed where sometimes using a shadow bomb leaves the player visible to other players and disables the ability to switch weapons or go into build mode.
* A bug has been fixed where redeploy is cancelled if a player reloads before attempting to redeploy.
* Players will now be able to automatically assign weapon slots so that a weapon is automatically placed in a predetermined slot based on your preference. This will minimize opening your inventory to rearrange weapons. Instead of hold to swap, players have the option to double tap a weapon/item to swap it.
* Chests now drop one weapon with an extra clip of its corresponding ammo, one non-weapon item and one healing item. Players also have the option to 5-hit farm unopened chests to obtain 50 wood and 50 metal. Since chests are guaranteed to spawn now, we will be actively looking to balance and possibly nerf the amount of chest/floor spawns.
* The reboot card popup will now disappear when looking at it, but the blue indicator pillar will remain the same to help locate the reboot van.

\*\*\*

# Audio:

* **HRTF audio is now released to help pinpoint in game sounds.\***
* **Audio sliders have also been implemented to allow for further fine-tuning audio such as weapon sounds, footsteps, glider sounds, structure break sounds, pickaxe sounds, environmental sounds, building sounds, character falling sounds, and emote sounds. These sliders allow for a maximum volume increase/ decrease of 50%.\***
* An audio bug has been fixed where players standing on objects in a building sounded as though they were on a higher floor.

Loot pool: Coming soon...

\*\*\*

Creative:

* **Custom crosshairs are now supported for all game modes. A crosshair creator map has been added to the creative island much like CSGO’s crosshair selection area where players will be able to shoot to select different crosshair pre-sets.\***
* A bug has been fixed which caused the wind sound effect to continually play in creative mode.
* **A bug has been fixed where players would get an unknown error upon trying to join a creative game in progress.**
* **A bug has been fixed where players joining a playground or creative game would freeze after a few minutes.\***

\*\*\*

# Healing:

* “Ooze juice” is dropped in stacks of 2 upon killing an enemy. They grant 25 base health or shield health (5 health per second). They can only be used when the first ooze juice completes its healing cycle. This has the potential to grant you and/or your team mates (if they are also splashed) 50 health over a span of 10 seconds minimum. Taking damage ceases the health regeneration effect.
* Chug jugs now give continuous health up to a maximum of 200. Players will be able to “chug”, gaining 10 health per second, and save the rest for later or share with a friend. We believe this healing buff better represents the legendary rarity of the item.
* Players with a bush equipped are now able to get health from chug splashes.
* Chug splashes now auto sort to the right if the player has auto-sort consumables to the right turned on.

\*\*\*

# Bug Fixes:

* A bug has been fixed where controller sensitivity was inconsistent between games.
* Players will no longer be able to shoot another player through a structure or door if a player or gun is clipping through the wall.
* A bug has been fixed where players were given the option to redeploy every time they jumped.
* A bug has been fixed that did not allow players to pick up items that were clustered near each other.
* A visual bug has been fixed where a “purchase” option was shown upon attempting to exit from the game.
* A visual bug has been fixed that caused the “add friends” menu screen to reappear even after selecting the “never show again” option.
* **A bug has been fixed where if custom binds are used on controller where you confirm edits with a different bind and go to build, you will not be able to build straight away as opposed to having default binds where you are able to build instantly.\***
* **A controller bug has been fixed where the game memory of the last weapon that was used is “lost” on controller upon switching from your pickaxe to your builds.\***
* **A controller bug has been fixed that occurred upon cancelling an edit where your previously held weapon switches to another weapon.\***
* A bug has been fixed where sometimes your teammate spectating you is able to see fall damage indicators of enemy players across the map.
* A texture bug has been fixed which sometimes caused traps to be invisible when placed in certain areas such as Tomato Temple.
* A visual glitch has been patched where players would sometimes get stuck inside their builds.
* Slow glider redeploy has been fixed. Players will now glide at normal speeds using glider redeploy.
* A visual bug has been fixed where flints and other single ammo clip weapons didn’t automatically reload.
* A bug has been fixed where your gun sometimes doesn’t shoot when “quickscoping”. This issue is mostly prevalent with the heavy sniper and tac shotgun. *We like to highlight all aspects of our game and so we ensured this bug would be put on full display when Tfue was unable to fire his heavy sniper three times in a row during a qualifying game for the world cup.*
* **A bug has been fixed where traps did not place on console upon holding down the “trap place” button.\***
* A bug has been fixed where traps appeared to be enemy traps after being fully built.
* A bug has been fixed where mouse and keyboard binds appeared for controller player on PC, making it so the player is unable to turbo build. This was put on full display when the glitch happened to Aydan during the Pro Am.
* A bug has been fixed where players were unable to pick up items when standing directly over top of them.
* **Two visual bugs have been fixed that have been in the game since season 1.\***

1. **Bullet trails sometimes caused an optical illusion causing players to think bullets were flying from the opposite direction.**
2. **A bullet shot from the left could potentially cause a shield break effect on the players right causing further confusion as to which direction the bullet came from.**

* A visual bug has been patched that sometimes caused the blue shield damage orb to remain on screen for the remainder of the match.
* A bug has been fixed that caused players to appear as default skins even though they were wearing different skins.
* A bug has been fixed that caused the grenade explosion animation to infinitely loop upon exploding underneath a landing supply drop.
* A visual glitch has been fixed that caused some trees to turn light green upon pickaxing them.
* A bug has been fixed that allowed players in shadow mode to fire their weapons even though the shadow animation had not completely worn off.
* A visual bug has been patched that caused certain pickaxes to cause FPS drops upon wielding.

# Survey:

In an effort to improve the game we have attached a small survey for all players that read the patch notes:

Would players like it if we implemented a small indicator such as a red X in the corner of the weapon graphic to show that a weapon has an empty clip?

Let’s talk about endgame optimization! Would these changes be something the community would like to test?

\- Storm damaging structures.

\- Structures from two circles ago being destroyed.

\- Different shaped storms that slowly move around organically.

\- Drone spawner that can summon your teammate next to you (5 second power up time).

\- We would love to hear community feedback on implementations or game additions that could balance the strength of low-ping wall taking techniques!

Here are a few community suggestions we may test:

* A freeze trap that could be placed in the centre of ones builds. Should an enemy steal your wall the freeze trap will activate, “freezing” the wall for 5 seconds which in turn freezes the enemy’s feet for that duration causing them to slide around. During this time the wall cannot be destroyed or edited.
* Cornstalk trap. You place the trap in your builds. The moment your builds are taken, and an enemy edit is made the trap activates. It spawns corn stalks throughout the entire interior of your builds that cannot be shot through also obscuring your enemies’ vision.
* Blueprint telemetry. A trap that allows your builds to regenerate 50 health/ second to all owned structures within 1 space away for 5 seconds.
* Turbo build overheat. Turbo building 5 consecutive structures causes your blueprints to catch fire and deal 2 damage/ second.
* If the stolen wall is connected to at least 5 other builds that belong to you: the wall will flash red for 0.5 seconds indicating that this wall will belong to both parties meaning both parties can edit it.

*Ping-based matchmaking has been chosen to test in an effort to diminish ping advantages within the game. During matchmaking lower ping players will be prioritized resulting in players with similar pings to be matched together.*

\*\*\*

As a controller player, the controller bugs are what I find to be the biggest nuisance. I have placed an asterisk and bolded the issues that literally haunt my sleep. Placing traps in this game is the bane of my existence. A well made 1v1, 2v2 playlist would catapult this game to new heights.

I realize that these suggestions may not appeal to everyone. Let's have a dialogue! ~~My EPIC is Weckberry if you want to gift me a skin or something..~~

**I am also working on a way to measure weapon balance within weapon classes. I have all the data laid out and now I just need to put it in good form. It was a pleasant surprise to find that parts of the latest patch were actually consistent with the suggestions I would have made when it comes to weapon balance according to the data I collected.**",FortniteCompetitive

In fact, the Singapore (SEA) server is already being used (since August 2018) in nothing but public matches, normal solo, duo and squad playlists, not even in LTMS.

The playerbase of the particular SEA server is not low,  also because there’s no correct way to measure it as only public matches use it. If it was to be measured, anyone that wishes to play Arena or any LTM will be directed to the Far East server in the edge of Asia, Japan. So they won’t be counted towards the playerbase of SEA, but instead will count towards Far East (Japan) region. 

India and Pakistan, which account for the most players get the lowest ping in their respected SEA server. And 190-200 in the Japan server. 

For the next World Cup possibly in a year, or any future tournament, please, in behalf of the hundreds of thousand players in the South East Asia region, give the Singapore server it’s very own matchmaking region and separate leaderboard, separate Arena and LTM matchmaking, just like how it is done in the East and West server in North America.

In my opinion the item pool is close to perfect. Ballers need to be vaulted obviously along with the storm flip (both buffed indirectly by the Rift to go vault), but in terms of weapons and consumables I'd say the only thing left for epic to do is to get rid of a few barely used weapons that clutter the pool.

The tactical shotgun is a prime suspect as it is still barely picked up and outclassed by both pump and combat, even with the buff. 

We also have 5 pistols in the game right now. Vault the deagle and the suppressed or regular pistol, the revolvers are pretty decent. 


Three snipers is also a bit much, any vault in this category would be welcome. 


The burst smg doesn't really fit into the meta but epic seems keen to keep a burst weapon in the game, just like they seem keen on the Scoped AR even tho we have a million ARs rn. Any of those could do with a vault too. 

Also, Mobility and Heals are in an all time best state of balance right now (pls vault ballers tho)

The burst has a great chance of doing a lot of damage really fast which allows for edit plays with it just has higher dps.

Also an interesting thing that also makes me think this is they pulled Team rumble that's been in the game for months and is the #1 casual mode. They probably did it so more people start playing the core modes and arena. I don't think Epic would kick their casuals to the side like that if there were enough of them to not warrant it.

60,thesagenibba,1561518288,c5k5pj,55,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/c5k5pj/solo_world_cup_predictions_why_the_veterans_will/,1,Solo World Cup Predictions: Why The Veterans Will Win,"If you take time to read a few posts discussing the topic of who the top performers will be at LAN, you will find the majority of the community stating that the younger pros will not perform at their highest potential due to several factors. If you date back to previous tournaments, you know that Epic did not allow anyone under the age of 16 to partake in competitive tournaments. A little bit before the World Cup was officially announced, Epic changed the rule &amp; made anyone who was at the minimum, 13 years old, eligible to participate. The decreasing of the age limit changed the landscape of Fortnite in ways that the community had never seen before. This led to the emergence of incredibly talented teenagers such as, Dubs, Megga, Clix, Bugha etc. to showcase their skill at a high level. Because of the sudden influx of young talent, the previous ""top"" players were now being challenged in terms of maintaining their position at the top &amp; their legacies. The new age of pros dominated in the World Cup qualifiers, but have been dubbed by many to be, ""0 Ping Warriors"" who won't be able to ""W-Key"" or play as aggressively as they usually would, against the worlds best, at LAN. 

   While I will not discredit &amp; take any skill away from the younger players, I will however, admit that I do in fact agree with the statement that the more experienced, veterans, will outclass the newer, young players, by a wide margin. If you take into account that the vast majority of World Cup Qualifiers are players that we have never seen compete in any of the early tournaments, experienced players seem like the favorites to win it all. A multitude of the qualified players not having ever participated sat a LAN is also another factor as to why veterans are favored. Although many players in the new generation have absurd mechanical skills, they lack the incredible game sense that players such as Bizzle, Vivid &amp; Tfue have. On top of that, a case can be made that someone like Tfue is a favorite simply because of the fact that he has nothing to lose. To put it simply, if you are part of the newer generation &amp; the World Cup will be your first ever LAN, you are already going into the tournament at a great disadvantage compared to someone like Tfue. In a past stream, Clix stated that he predicts Tfue will win the solo tourney simply because of his situation &amp; experience. Tfue does not have to worry about the prize money that he will or will not obtain. To add calm nerves &amp; experience on to that, he is already leagues above the rest of his competition. Someone like Clix has to worry about the prize money that he can possibly acquire, his first LAN, &amp; nerves. 

This leads me to my next point, play style. It's been said by many that the flashiness &amp; aggressive style of play put on by the newer talent will simply not be viable against the worlds best &amp; most experienced players. Changing the style of play &amp; pacing can have a massive effect on a players performance, in turn diminishing their level of play. Someone like Mongraal, who is accustomed to pushing players &amp; for the most part, winning these pushes &amp; box fights will be put at a disadvantage because of the fact that an overly aggressive strategy will not work at the World Cup. Another major factor is composure. It's obvious that players who have experience &amp; are known to have calm nerves such as Tfue &amp; Bizzle, will be in great positions compared to younger, inexperienced players who's nerves will be all over the place. Let's say, hypothetically, none of the factors that I previously listed have a negative effect on someone like Bugha, nervousness might completely alter his play, making him rethink decisions, make easy mistakes, &amp; overall, tilt the player. 

   In summary, I believe that this is accepted &amp; believed by the majority of the community. This doesn't mean that we can be completely wrong &amp; witness the younger pros overcome our expectations &amp; predictions, &amp; completely play out at the World Cup, in turn, changing the competitive landscape &amp; play style forever. 

TL:DR- Experienced pros such as Tfue, Zayt, Bizzle, Vivid etc. favored to win over the younger pros like Mongraal, Bugha, Clix, Dubs etc. Popular opinion but, I wanted to provide reasoning for why the majority of people believe this, whether it was obvious or not. Who knows, I &amp; anyone else who shares my opinion can be totally wrong. We'll all find out at the same time when New York comes.",FortniteCompetitive

If you think we need the purple/gold back because the green/blue are underperforming for you, maybe it’s because you haven’t used the gun for months.

However, I do want to be “really good.” But I am not sure how to be better than I am than just the “got to play everyday and practice.” 

***Kovaaks: Aim Workout Routines by AIMER7***  
 I recently started using this guide and find it good. I have been using the complete beginner routine consisting of: Close long strafes, 1wall6targets TE, FuglaaXYLongStrafe, Tile Frenzy Strafing 101, Vertical long strafes, and 1wall target. I am on day 5 out of 14 and have been seeing improvements by raising my personal bests. I kept the X,Y aim configuration to Fortnite along with the FOV. I’ll continue to follow this guide until the end of it. 

***Solos: Season 9 Kill to Death Ratio = 1.15***   
 I have been dropping in the popular drops now but most of the time, I am back in the lobby. But at the end of the games, I do check the replays of what I could have done better. Examples of getting out build when I have plenty of materials to build, missing multiple shots near point blank with combat, and unable to track the player within the builds. 

***Creative: Build battles, Edit tutorials, etc.***   
 We play 1v1 build battles sometimes with my friends but they’re not as active as I am and don’t really have any online friends to play with. I would like to play with people who are better than me. Is there a community that is willing to scrim/play turtle wars/etc? In addition, I have been using Candook's 5 minute World Cup tutorial and SpeedyGonzalez's 15 minute edit tutorial. I feel these have been helping my edit game immensely as I have seen myself slowly getting more edit kills and using edits to find enemies within build battles/escaping out of build battles.

In addition to those, I have been doing 90s right sided for the past few weeks and see major improvement. I will admit though, I have not used it in game. I am slowly learning left sided 90s. I understand that this is the quickest way to get high ground, but it just seems like if the opponent has high ground and im doing 90s, they have it so easy to shoot me from above. Yah? 

***Youtube videos:***   
 I used to watch educational commentary by SypherPK a few months back. It was good to learn his thought process. But I transitioned to “itsJerian” videos and its more of a “how to” video than a though process video which I like a lot. if anyone has other recommendations for youtube videos, please share. I am wanting to look at a guide for shotgun battles that is involving with the pump. 

***Other thoughts:***

I think one of my issues that I don't do is shoot/build/shoot as I just try to shoot and if I have a clean shot, I will wait to shoot again. With the new patch out, can someone confirm with me the best way to play with the pump shotgun is to ""shoot/build/shoot/build/repeat?"" Other mechanics I lack is quick thinking such as falling fast and not breaking my fall with the flint knockback gun or just simply knowing when to use a jump pad.

Making such drastic changes each week alters the game and causes players who should be in the WC left out and ones who qualified that shouldn't be. 

For instance, this last duo qualifier my teammate and I had 3 rift to gos. We got 2nd with 14 kills. Hard to imagine we'd have that many kills with no rifts. 

Also consider the people who qualified week 1 or 2 when ballers didn't have 150 health.

Here is why.," I have been saying since day one of this season that the pump and later the silenced smg would be unvaulted on exactly this patch. How did I know? Simple. Epic is protecting and maximizing  it's investment in a multi million dollar advertising campaign. The world cup. 


People often ask me to take off my foil hat when I say this stuff. I would respond by telling them that if I am right, the pump would be back the very first update after week 10 qualifiers. So shout-out to all those people who called me crazy. Will any of you have the balls to step up and admit my theory was probably right?


 They know that the majority of their target demographic is too young to afford a gaming computer. I they did save up, that means money for vbucks gets sent to Intel etc. instead. These people want to feel like they could compete with the pro's. They also feel like they are part of something special when announcers talk about the Controller Gang. They realized the controller gang would be very demotivated if the trend of world cup qualifiers being entirely mouse and keyboard (maybe one controller player??) continued. They might give up their grind to get noticed even though they 100% know they are the most underrated pro in the game. They might quit because of this. 

Someone at Epic likely realized that unless they intervened that there may be nobody in the controller gang at the world cup. Not surprising since everyone in the comp scene was feeling that pre season 9. How could they solve this and put some controller players in their event without looking like complete frauds for tampering with the qualifier process?

In comes the new meta. This meta removes the pump swap skill that was much harder to master on console and dominated a massive amount of engagements. It replaces it with a meta that is very L2 friendly and has less need to swap guns than anything seen before. It even nerfed almost all powerful plays that required good mechanics by having the swap delay so much longer than the fire rate of the combat. Edit plays and other things that required a shotgun to be pulled mid fight were basically worthless. Anybody who has played on controller knows those are the hardest plays to do especially when comparing to mouse n keyboard. 

So I have been telling people that the meta is made to put controller players in the world cup. It worked VERY well. Anyone can look at the stats and see their was an unprecedented increase in controller placement/qualifications that can not be explained by anything besides the change in meta. 

Call me crazy all you want. I know my theory is probably spot on.",FortniteCompetitive

I think now it's about time. that we are able to customize our CUSTOM games!

*- let the host chose any previous LTM or mode as game rules*

It's pretty clear that epic games doesn't want a system where the host can select every single setting by himself (like customize storm, lootpool etc...) This isn't going to happen, because epic wants us to use their rulesets. However with my suggested way, we would exactly play whatever mode Epic has put together.

While there can't be many LTM's active at the same time in matchmaking, because it splits the playerbase and increases queue time - you don't have these problems in custom games. This way content creators who want to play with their communities have so much more options and can just choose any mode at any time (The floor is lava/ Wick's bounty/ Solid Gold/ Siphon or just Arena, etc...)

*- choose number of players per team*

Pretty self explanatory... Instead of the current system where you host a duo arena game. You would host an arena game and set the teamsize to 2. This way we wouldn't depend on what the teamsize in LTM's is when they come out. We could already practice trio or squad arena scrims this way. And with the new squad feature where you can have up to 16 player in a party it would allow sutff like [""discord wars""](https://twitter.com/zayt/status/1121990607562473472?lang=de) where bigger groups of friends could fight each other. Alternatively you could play Squad rumble in smaller teams of 4 etc...


Like you see it just takes 2 options to chose and allow for a big variety of different and more fun ways to play the game. This would be super nice for content creators as well as competitive players.

Epic would have to adjust the current system a little bit, so that as player you don't have to select the game mode yourself. But you just put in the key and can join as long as your party isn't too big and there is enough room in the lobby.

This leads to another suggestion. Hosts should be able to see who is in the lobby! Basically any other game I've played before lets you see who is waiting in the lobby. That way the host can make sure the right people are in tournaments and nobody that got a leaked key or is a known griefer joins the game. It can't be that hard to have a *playerlist*...",FortniteCompetitive

There is very limited RNG (only spawn location and 1 random item) due to starting with load outs. No one has to spend time farming mats. No one is screwed if they don’t have mobility. The most exciting part of watching competitive is the late game zones and this gets straight to it. Teams would need really good comms and could develop strategies. For example, FaZe Sway made it hard for TSM to take height due to his playground warrior abilities. Teams would win the match by winning a number of rounds, so there is potential for exciting comebacks. 

Obviously I doubt it could replace the Battle Royale aspect of Fortnite, but it could be quite competitive and I’m sure people would get into it. They have a creative tournament for world cup, so adding a tournament outside of a Battle Royale is not too far fetched.

I shouldn't be landing and there's a choice of a burst smg and a... burst smg. There's a difference between common and too fucking common. This meta is fucking straight dogshit, I just want a meta that consists of no burst, no tacs, hell not even combats at this point. Just a meta with a normal suppressed smg, a common/uncommon/rare pump, and heavy shotguns. Right now, if you get a burst SMG, you're going to get smacked by almost any gun but most likely a tac. If you get a tac, you're going to get smacked by a longer distance by a combat. It's a whole different of frustration because with the pump, you still have to fight at a closer range and you had a better chance of receiving that pump. You never get a combat and when someone else does, it's almost a no brainer that person with the combat wins. I know RNG is apart of the game but holy shit, this RNG compared to S4-S5 RNG, it's just a no doubter how shit it is now compared to then. I just believe Epic needs to be accountable about how dumb their decision making is. Sorry if this is the 10000th rant you saw on this subreddit today but holy shit, Epic needs to wake the fuck up and realize they're overflowing the item rate with dogshit items like burst SMGs.

But as a console player myself I just don’t see how that could be the case.

Straight up only a handful of console players can keep up with pc players which shows during the World Cup. Don’t get me wrong I love the World Cup but as a console player it’s kind of a let down not seeing console players compete like back in the day when Aydan and Nicmercs would battle it out in Titled Towers.

Even when I’m playing some arena I tend to find that about a good 40-60% of players are using keyboard even though I’m on console and when it comes to final circles it’s a struggle to keep up and I’m roughly on 270-290 points. (Might be cause I’m bad 😂)

So, two things I wanna say here:


(1. If you are on the fence about changing them, do it. Before changing, I was pretty mechanically skilled, much more so than my game sense. After changing, I’m obviously not gonna be as good as I was right off the bat, but you should definitely be able to tell things will be easier to do. Before, I had to make large finger movements to do any builds (F-Wall, C-Stair, V-Trap, T-Cone, E-Edit, all with my index) now, I find pressing builds in quick succession much less fatiguing. I understand that you can be great building on one finger, but I would still recommend exposing yourself to other ways. 


(2. I know this might sound silly, but record a video or quick clip of you building in creative on new binds every day. You’re likely to get discouraged and want to switch back, but if you video yourself each day, you’ll see new progress and how much you improved. It means a lot to see yourself get better.",FortniteCompetitive

Playing arena customs the other day we had 60 people in small zones and 40 first moving the game ran smoothly despite the spamming of builds, gls etc. This is a massive feat, it is incredibly hard to optimize a game to what you need for a stacked endgame and this means world cup will be much more competitve as players wont have to play around lag. There won't be any nickmerks situations when at a big lan he was douing with adyan playing solo and hanging at the back of the zone, but because of lag the zone magically over took him.

Fortnite is doing a 14 days of summer event, where each day there is a new skin, ltm, and weapon (a weapon unvaulted for 24 hours).

Most people's reaction to this is probably negative, but I don't think it is going to be a bad event for the community, I actually think it will be a good event that will help people train for the next competitive events that come along. Looking through the LTM's show that some of them will be useful for practice. I'm going to analyze the different LTM's and show what I think they could be helpful, or not.

Blog post: [https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/14-days-of-summer](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/14-days-of-summer)

&amp;#x200B;

# Heavy Metal Squads

\-Only weapons with heavy in the name

\-Faster metal farming

\-Faster storm times

I am ambivalent about this LTM, it is just essentially one of the ""only so and so weapons"" LTM's we have had in the past, won't be bad but won't be good either. (Could help with aim though because no smg's and only heavy ak for ar)

&amp;#x200B;

# Storm Chasers: Surfin'

\-Only on vehicles

\-Use impulses to knock people off

\-Last man standing

Eh, it might be kind of fun but I don't many people will play it after they do the challenge for it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Splashdown Squads

\-Respawning

\-Damage with new water balloon

\-First to certain score wins

Same as the Storm Chasers one above, could be fun but might be boring after a little bit

&amp;#x200B;

# Power Up Solos

\-Respawning on at start, but turned off at some point

\-Max shields increase every time you consume shields

\-Increased shield drops

\-Shields fill up to full when respawning is turned off

I think it could be a good LTM for practicing endgame (because respawning is on in the beginning), but it favors playing passive and looting. If the max shields can't be increased a ton (like over 100 more) I think it could be a good LTM for practicing endgame.

&amp;#x200B;

# Leave None Behind Duos

\-Slurp effect always active when teammates are alive (not knocked)

\-If a teammate is knocked, they cannot be killed but you take damage

I think that this will be good to work with a teammate for coordination. People who have a lot of coordination with their duo will excel as they will be at an advantage when they attack together and coordinate. People who don't communicate will be always suffering when their teammate inevitably gets downed. Could be good for people working with teammates for duos events in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

# Use With Care Duos

\-Spawns with initial amount of mats, cannot get more.

\-Battle Royale type

Will help with not using excessive mats. Players who don't spam but only build what they need will be ahead of everybody else (90's without walls will probably be used a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

# Headshots Duos

\-Only damage with headshots

\-No shotguns

Kovaaks but with building... what more do I need to say?

My one criticism is that they took out shotguns so you can't practice flick shots, but I understand why they did it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tank Battle Squads

\-Much more health

\-**Siphon**

\-More ammo

\-No healing

First of all, siphon, so... Second of all, without ammo and heals, you don't need to loot as much and can spend more time fighting. I think it will be just a fun gamemode that the competitive community will love.

&amp;#x200B;

# Builders Paradise Squads

\-Structures have a ton more HP

\-More resource gathering

\-Anyone can edit anything

Basically giant buildfights everwhere, where noobs cannot knock you down easily, and the best editor will have an advantage. I see no way anybody competitive could dislike this gamemode unless they are bad at building/editing :)

&amp;#x200B;

# Wick's Bounty Duos

\-Same as the John Wick gamemode from before

Many people said this is the most competitive gamemode the game has had, so I don't expect people will complain about this one. It is a fun gamemode aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

# Arsenal (Solos)

\-Start with best weapons

\-Elims give you worse weapons

\-First to get a kill with final weapon wins

Essentially like Gun Game, but you don't respawn. So you have to play aggressive, be good with all the weapons at the same time, and not die to win. It will be good practice for different weapons and a lot of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

# New Team Rumble... SKIP

&amp;#x200B;

# Loadout Swap Squads

\-New random loadout every amount of seconds

\-Can respawn

\-First to goal score wins

Will be good practice for every weapon, and, like the Wick's Bounth, you start with weapons and don't really need to loot. Will be very fun.

&amp;#x200B;

# Strategic Structures Squads

\-Metal/Stone structure health increased

\-Metal/Stone farming increased

\-Metal/Stone material cap lowered

Could be good practice for lategame where you need to know when to use specific materials instead of wood. I think it will be interesting, but most players don't really care what material they use, so I don't think it will be very popular.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

Overall I think this event will be very fun. Most of the LTM's will be semi-competitive, and will help practice for normal BR. The one thing I am worried about is the unvaulting a new weapon every day, but I don't think it will have too much of a effect on how people play.

My thoughts," Sup boys. I just wanted to share a new strat/theory that popped into my head watching Khuna stream earlier. It is purely speculative, so please take it with a grain of salt. Khuna was playing solo customs and died to what appeared to be an inferior player, at which point he called him a “f*cking virgin”. This insightful remark got me thinking.

It’s been established that it seems to be the younger demographic dominating the competitive scene, but why? I propose the idea that it’s because they are likely virgins, and having sex may forfeit some sort of unique power they possess deep within their loins that allows them be so much better than everyone else (namely, sex-havers). Not to brag, but as a sex haver myself, I can confirm that when I first parked my pink Porsche down a side-alley, I was never the same. I now wonder if my gamesense, aim and KD would be much better had I never done the deed.

I have a few examples I’d like to share. First: Mongraal, savage, and benjy are widely regarded as some of the best players in the game. Their respective ages? 14, 14, 15 (correct me if I’m wrong). Now I don’t know how it works across the pond, but in my experience in the states, if you’re slaying poon at that age you’d be considered an absolute legend. If these boys are in fact pulling at that age, GG's boys. But I’m not so sure. I propose these players are virgins and this is part of what allows them to be so dominant.

To further bolster this example, I will reference Mongraal’s statements on stream/twitter.

https://twitter.com/Mongraal/status/1142977058903076865

https://twitter.com/Mongraal/status/1141504002791809024

https://twitter.com/teamsecret/status/1138804541560958977

https://twitter.com/Mongraal/status/1135724472630226945

Again, purely speculative, but in my opinion these are the tweets of a very horny individual, possibly because he is a virgin. I personally believe mongraal is aware of this theory, hence his decision to pursue a gf (and presumably a one-way ticket to poundtown) AFTER world cup. Smart player.

My last example touches on one of my favorite (and a very well-regarded) professional organization. Team Liquid. A dominant presence in the competitive scene UNTIL world cup, where they unfortunately disappointed given their high standards (with the exception of vivid, shoutout the absolute god). Let’s look at Poach. We find out he’s been dating Electra, no qual - coincidence? You decide. Chap - I have zero concrete evidence here, but let’s be honest, an absolute unit like that probably is doing alright for himself in that department. Tom? An absolute stallion, and we all know luscious beards are meta right now in the dating world, you think he’s doing well with the ladies? H*ll fucking yeah. Also myth dropped off the competitive scene shortly after announcing he lost his virginity. Makes you think.

Again, this is by no means intended to be a blanket statement, as there are clear exceptions to the rule: tfue qualifying solo despite his public relationship with Corinna Kopf (gg’s only my guy), Aydan who lives with his girlfriend, and xxif/Ronaldo qualifying despite their obvious virginity status. Just wanted to share to all my fellow grinders trying to get better. Consider abstinence if you really want to make it in the comp world.",FortniteCompetitive

I feel like dropping with a combat would make the playing field so much more even and lessen the amount of rage people have towards the starting game. I could be wrong tho,FortniteCompetitive

Clash royale),"Note: this is gonna be long probably. I will discuss things in clash royale and things in brackets will be the [fortnite equivalent]

Now if you’ve played clash royale recently, you will know how balanced this game truly is, and no I’m not memeing. I’m for real about this comparison. 

So let’s talk about the way CR balances cards. The first Monday of every month, they implement small but effective balance changes to cards they feel need balancing. If one card dominates and is used in most people’s deck [combat shotgun] they slightly nerf the card, and if a card is underused [tactical shotgun], they slightly buff it. There is not vaulting in CR. The reason they balance monthly is so they can look at the meta and see what cards are popular in decks [guns in loadout] and try to balance so any deck made by someone who knows what they are doing is effective [making tac as viable as combat]. Changes are not made weekly because supercell has to wait and analyze before making bad decisions too early. 

The changes made to each card are very small, but have purpose. Every change is made with thought [the only good nerf I can think of off the top of my head is drum gun]. Maybe it’s so a card will get 1 less hit if before it dies or will be able to defeat another card it died to before. 

So the drum gun nerf, in my opinion was one of the best, I think it was -2 damage, but the gun was balanced very well, so you don’t have to pick it up [before you pretty much needed to because it was so op], but you can pick it up if you like it and prefer it over he tac ar. 

If you play CR now, no one kind of deck is dominating because they are are pretty equal in strength. Of course, some deck will always counter other decks, and so on, but if you like using ______ card, you can use it because it’s balanced. 

So what about Fortnite? I think all guns should be about even in relevancy. Obviously the gray pistol will never be as good as a gold combat, but if you like the tac shotgun, it should be just about equal to the combat, where they both have drawbacks. [right now, there is almost no reason to use the tac over the combat]

So what can we learn? 
- Small but effective nerfs are best. [Automatically vaulting a gun because it’s op/under powered isn’t always the way to go]
- Monthly changes give time for the meta to develop, and then you can make well-thought out changes from there
- Your goal should be to make it so all cards [guns] are about equal

PS. I know there might be some of you saying. “But I enjoy the tac shotgun” and yes, there is nothing stopping you from using it, but the reason people usually like guns is because they are good, and the tac shotgun is not. So if you really want to win, you are not going to use the tac shotgun unless you have to. If you are playing to have fun, do whatever the f*ck you want. I’m not trying to stop you.",FortniteCompetitive

This would also fix the problem of people asking for a central server. I know that the people who currently get zero ping would be pissed which is understandable, but I think it would be more reasonable to allow people in Florida and Texas to play on ping that would allow them to compete in online tournaments and have a fair chance and the people who get zero ping now would still likely get 20 or less ping.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past weeks I see everyone complaining mainly about heavy sniper, boom bow and the proximity launcher. Aren't stinks way more powerful than any of them?

* Rare (blue) rarity instead of epic/legendary
* Takes no skill to use. You just throw them lol
* No way of knowing where they are coming from
* They travel too fast + no sound until it's too late
* ABSOLUTELY NO WAY of countering them. You just have to run away

&amp;#x200B;

The maddest part is that if someone has 6 of them and you are in a box without campfires or slurp you basically are done for (providing the other guy has IQ greater than 1 and is patient).

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah boom bow, proximity and even the aids 150 body shot from heavy sniper are annoying; but how come I see so few posts about stinks? Am I missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

And there are so many fixes to them, seriously. The best I've read is to make their damage similar to the storm. Where you have at least 1 second to react. Or just reduce their AOE (area of effect).

My solution is to make the storm always see through like in colorblind. Epics solution is probably to make it non see through on all color settings though.",FortniteCompetitive

Recently, NRG's benjyfishy has brought the yellow stair ""exploit"" some popularity. For those of you that are not familiar with it, essentially if you are completely backed up against a wall and place a stair, it remains in a yellowish state allowing you to edit/shoot through because your player model prevents the stair from going to a fully built state. I messed around with this concept and applied it to pyramids/cones and it works very similarly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The cone technique can be done in one of 2 ways.**

1. Stand on one of the 4 corners of a previously built floor (you do not want to be directly on the edge. But you also want to be away from the direct center). Place a cone on top of yourself and if you have done it correctly, it should build in the exact yellow color that benjyfishy's stair builds. From here, you have minor room to wiggle around and get different angles to see/shoot your opponents.
2. The second technique is much more efficient/optimal for competitive use. In this technique, you would already be in a fully built 1x1 (4 walls, floor/cone above you, and floor/cone below you). This is a very common turtle used in competitive play, specifically recently in the World Cup. From here you can do either a half edit on the floor above you or a 3-way edit (not sure exactly what it is called but there's a demonstration in the video below) and then do a diagonal edit on the cone below you allowing you to get yourself into the cone on top of your turtle. Many players use this technique to peek in late game scenarios to sneak shots on flying opponents or just to catch opponents off guard. Once you are in your top cone, reset the floor edit that got you there. This next step is where this technique becomes risky. You have to edit any corner of the cone that you are in, quickly step halfway out (towards the corner of your floor) and reset your cone. This will put your cone into the ""yellow"" state and allow you to shoot at opponents. Since this is the most optimal use for this technique I have shown how its done in the YouTube video below. It can be done with all 3 material types and even though part of your LOS (line of sight) is blocked by the cone, you can slightly wiggle around to get different angles to shoot your opponents while they rotate/glide in.

I have highlighted the 2nd technique in the video below with all 3 material types. As you can see in the video, the character model is almost completely hidden with this technique (making it very difficult for players to punish). In fully built metal, the character's head is also almost completely hidden. Using brick/wood is more risky as it exposes the player's head slightly more. Furthermore, if a player that is executing this technique is to get shot at by an opponent, he/she can simply walk into the center of the cone for it to fully build and that would provide immediate protection (shown in the video). I apologize for the long break from competitive content as I was going through some things IRL but I am back and looking to continue making strategy videos if you guys want.

*About Me:*

Name: Jamie

Age: 25

Nationality: British

Servers: EU

Fortnite stuff: Played all 10 weeks of qualifiers, made finals 3 times. Highest placement was Week 3 (Finals) where I placed #621. Reached finals of Scallywag/Luxe Cup also. 

I’m extremely vocal and will *always* communicate with you. I’ll tell you everything I’m doing and everything I have loot wise. Incredibly unselfish player. Whatever you need, I will do my upmost to help you. 

I obviously take each tournament as serious as possible, but I’m also a person who likes to joke and laugh. I’m not toxic either. I find it difficult to tilt. Ultimately, it’s about improving going forward. 

I have a very large training island with everything you could ever want to improve, ranging from Box Fighting zones to Kovaak style courses. This will be our hub for everything practice wise.

If you’re interested in partnering up and starting a beautiful friendship, let me know.

You have one rarity of all guns.

There’s no inequality if someone were to get a grey AR vs a gold scar and you can’t really do much from the damage differences. The metal and brick farming rate increases are also nice since they’re harder to come by and not as easily obtainable as wood.

That is why a team shuffle wasn't too uncommon to see - players from top teams switching to each other's team and what not, as well as new teams being formed.

In Fortnite, apparently, it seems like people have decided that the reason they haven't lived up to their own expecations is their keybinds, and so we are witnessing the biggest keybind shuffle Fortnite has ever known.

There was nothing to play for once you hit champs, and arena is almost pointless now. 

It would be good to see a revamped ranked mode come out now. I personally like the idea of a FIFA style ranked system. With maybe 4 or 5 divisions, blocks of 10 matches, you either get demoted, remain in the same division or promoted, depending on point thresholds. Leaderboards would always always reflect a 10 game spread and be meaningful. I think it would also be cool to use this system to qualify for weekend tournaments eg. the top x amount of scores during the week in the top division gain entry to money events on the weekend.

I’m not a top tier player but I only really enjoy playing this game competitively now so I just want a good competitive mode to play.",FortniteCompetitive

The constant meta shifts &amp; map changes force pro players to constantly adapt, whether the meta favors them or not. Until now, we've seen the majority of renown streamers consistently place well in Pop-Up Cups, Pro-Scrims, &amp; other competitive tournaments. If you're to take a look back at previous tournaments such as Winter Royale, you will notice that the amount of notable pros that qualified in the top 100 was minuscule to the amount of unknown or lesser known players. If you go even farther back, towards some of the first competitive tournaments such as, Fall Skirmish &amp; Summer Skirmish, familiar pros are found at the top of the leaderboards. 

The statement above leads me to my primary question. Was the early stages of competitive Fortnite more of a popularity contest &amp; not exactly as competitive as possible? It's quite obvious that participation in early competitions were only available to popular players because of the fact that Fortnite was an up &amp; coming game, with no previous competitive experience. I find it interesting how the early Skirmishes set a basis on who spectators considered the best players because of the fact that popularity was a key principal of being able to partake in these competitions. Influence &amp; streamer count hindered talented players with smaller platforms to place themselves among the best of the best, at the time. Because of the blatant bias of early Fortnite competitions, one is allowed to argue that the best players at the time are mere streamers who decided to take part in competitive &amp; not necessarily great players. Does this mean that World Cup Qualifiers are a true deciders on who the greatest players in the World really are? Or, can different metas, maps, &amp; formats heavily skew who is seen as the best? With plenty of prominent figures in the community not qualifying for New York, people are quick to say that they were never actually as good as they were made out to be &amp; were only seen as top players because of their ""clout"". This leads me to a prediction. 

Because the first major competitive Fortnite tournament will most likely show us who is at the top, I predict one of two things will occur within the next two seasons:

1. Former popular streamers will not be able to adapt to the new wave of competitive players &amp; shift to strictly being content creators/full time streamers. With this in turn leaving the preiviously qualified World Cup players as the best of the best, &amp; the future of competitive Fortnite.
2. With a new map &amp; meta, our familiar cast will eventually bounce back &amp; solidify themselves as formidable players in competitive Fortnite, making it known that one tournament is not a prime decider on who the best players are.",FortniteCompetitive

What most people want is a ranked mode where you can go and climb in ranking. Similar to that of overwatch let’s say. 

Where you have the option to play “quick play” or “competitive” depending on your mood. 

The benefits to have a ranked mode is that most competitive players are likely to play ranked mode. This is not saying that you won’t run into sweats in normal lobbies, there will just be fewer sweats in public matches because they will be busy grinding.

I would set up the brackets as such
0-1000 Bronze 
1001-1500 Silver
1501-2000 Gold
2001-2500 Platinum 
2501+ is Diamond

INCENTIVES OF RANKED MODE:
Each of these ratings should have their own set of gear that can only be purchased once you reach that rating. 

To give example, there will be a (Skin/Pick axe/Glider maybe even an emote) for each ranking (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) would have their own items. So say I just got to Gold ranking (1501-2000) I would now be able to purchase a skin/glider/pickaxe that represents my skill level. And each season these items will be changed for new items. 

Without an incentive based system, what is to encourage players from playing other sweats all day? I don’t consider myself a sweat but I drop multiple 14+ kill games on the regular, 17 being my highest. You have to understand I am a casual player who enjoys killing noobs. You think the people at the top don’t also enjoy killing noobs? So if you want “Sweats” gone then you have to incentivize Ranked. ",FortniteCompetitive

I understand that game sense is an important factor when it comes to the difference between players but I was thinking about my weaknesses as a player and was wondering whether I would benefit from a higher sens for the editing and build benefits.

I guess my question doesn't just apply to edits, although I thought of asking this question solely due to fast edits, but it could also apply to taking high ground which I struggle with after being forced to box up in a 1x1. I was watching savagem solo squading on stream and I can't tell you how many times his high sens saved his ass when he was boxed up, facing a squad with 20hp.

I play at 800dpi 0.055 and I'm feeling comfortable with my shots right now, but I feel just a tad bit behind in terms of my building. I don't know what it is? Maybe I'm just bored and want to try something new? I hope not because in that case I will end up probably getting frustrated and switch back to my old sens. Do you guys think it's worth the increase? I know it's asked a lot, but I'm thinking of increasing to 800dpi 0.08 which I've tried before and it feels more comfortable to me then my current sens at 0.055 but I'm not accurate enough with it.

Thanks for any input :) it's greatly appreciated! And sorry if the formatting is shit, mobile can be like that sometimes haha",FortniteCompetitive

So let me start off by saying I have this addiction to Fortnite. I wake up, play it, eat breakfast, play it, shower, play it, and sometimes I’ll bring my PC to school to play it. The grind never stops for ya boy. I have a motto tatted on my wrist, “pump smg 24/7”. That’s right, I'm cracked.

Anyways, I work at a grocery store. I’m a stocker. Sometimes I get really bored and start thinking about Fortnite. I day dream about becoming a pro, banging Tfue and just being the nastiest player on the keyboard anyone will ever meet. I start saying random shit out loud when I’m really in the zone. When I lift something heavy up I’ll just say out of no where “I'm White” and someone will help me lift it. or when I see a spill and a customer is about to walk over it I stop them and say “i got a rift” and I’ll clean it up instead of forcing maintenance to grab the mop.

But last weekend, I was minding my own business, daydreaming about killing Bizzle in a 1v1 in the finals of the world cup. Then this really aggressive father is yelling at his kid. The kid is like 14 or 15, not an actual kid. Anyways, the kid refused to follow orders, and the dad kept getting more furious and eventually turns physical. He starts pushing his kid, and the kid is crying. And this is late at night, so no one but me is near them. The kid says “I hate you” and oh my goodness, the father struck him across the face. The kid hit him back and pushed him against the wall, hitting his head. The dad was weak, looked really shook.

My fortnite instincts amped up. It was fucking go time. I thought I was on the main stage in the world cup. So I w key towards the dad and say “YO YOU’RE ONE SHOT LEMME GET YOUR TRADE” and I proceed to absolutely demolish the kid, fist on nose action. I was mind blown. I knew right there I fucked up. This wasn't the finals of the world cup, this was real life. I just assaulted a teenager. But as the cops were dragging me out of the store, the dad whispered with a smile, “the good ole bait n switch.”",FortniteCompetitive

Instead of incentivizing thirsting, how about a different mechanic such as a one time material and health gain for downing someone - once activated regardless of what happens (they get revived), they will not provide health or materials again.

Even just adding the materials straight into your inventory instead of dropping at the downed players body, which allows you to continue fighting and very little to gain from thirsting. And if your full on material they would just drop like would normally happen if you tried harvesting materials when full.

(Solos),"I'm sure it'd be easier to do solo duo/ solo squad. But there's something satisfying about dropping a lot of kills in regular solos. I have 15+ games where I've got 15-17 kills. And I've had one game where I got 18. I drop what I calculate to be the hottest drop. I slay out there, rotate wherever I think people may be. Push every last person I see, even if it feels like a stupid fight to take. I don't stop being aggressive until beating my record isn't possible and then I may slow up to secure the dub. I drop tilted unless it's towards end of the bus and therefore not the hottest drop anymore (flights over retail are always hot af.) Earlier I pushed into a 5 man build fight at the outpost over lonely  (becoming the 6th man) somehow managed to take out all of them and then ended the game with 17, again. I'm far from complaining and every single one of them feels great but I desperately want that 20 bomb. In squads I sometimes can get 14 to 15 but if we end up winning teammates will either steal my kills or they all die and then I solo squad for awhile until I get focused by 4 man squad AR spamming. Anyway does anyone have any suggestions for getting that sweet 20 bomb? I feel as if I have it in me but I can never find enough people.

&gt;I'd say I am a good player and have a solid 30% win-rate in all modes while pushing for kills/hot dropping. The new update on shields/health per kill has literally made me and every other good player near unstoppable (I've won 80% of my games today and broken my duo kill record), and yes while it's fun to literally never have to worry about dying it also has a negative impact on new/unskilled players in these lobbies as they now have less chance of winning games as pub-stomping is 10x easier.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am sorry for the people who don't understand what BR is supposed to stand for which is most of this sub but the nature of Battle Royale games emphasises survival, and not brainlessly W-keying with no consequence.  
&gt;  
&gt;IMO this is not healthy for the future of the game and I'd rather die to a bot while I have 10 kills and about 70 health than see this game decline. Whether people on this sub like it or not, bots/casuals make and break games.  
&gt;  
&gt;tldr; Keep shields per kill in ranked/pop up cups where people are similar skill level.

  
It's clearly showing that either less casuals are playing solos or everyone has become really good in just 2 weeks. 2 weeks ago when Epic games added health per kill, nearly everyone on this sub was having a blast pub-stomping which is ironically funny because more than half the people here find ""pub-stomping"" boring and now that pubs have become a little harder than before people don't seem to enjoy it? where most of you just stunting?  


I said it before and I will say it again, health per kill does not belong in public lobbies whether it allows you to pub-stomp (early days of the update) or get into sweaty fight after fight (these past days). Just enjoy battle royales the way they're supposed to be; RNG, that's what makes the game work, that's what keeps casuals happy. Keep health per kill in sbmm/pop-up cups.",FortniteCompetitive

You have these players with clearly way more experience by how they edit and build, but at the end of the day I still fk em up. Why? Because all I have to do is shoot you. So many times I get edited on by “good” players and all I had to do was ads, and as soon as I saw that opening you lost all your health. 

I don’t even try to get high ground I just try to shoot you. I might be in a box, like always they try to break it and kill you but like always they get their head blown off as soon as they give me an opening. There’s nothing simple about it. All this editing and advanced building is cool and all, but your gun is what kills me. So even tho I build like a complete bot sometimes or mostly, I win fights majority just because of simple shit. 

As a cod player my reactions are extremely good, and my aim is also really good. So yea its cool people know how to build and edit, but at the end of the day does it really matter all that much?

* Run them more often. In the recent AMA they said they wanted players to be able to ""compete whenever they want"". So why aren't they running them 24/7? 

* Explore different point systems. Why not get crazy? Have a ""Placement Cup"", where you only get placement points, no kill points. And an ""Elim Cup"", where it's only points for eliminations.

* Furthermore, why not a ""Console Cup"", only for consoles? Or a ""Mobile Cup""? They could rotate all these different cups throughout the days/weeks.

* How about a 'Beginner' division in addition to the 'Open' division? Only available to players who haven't won before or in the last month or whatever.

* Different game modes. Competitive Royal Rumble? Why not?

There's probably way more ideas here too, and they could run all these different cups, just cycling them throughout the day/week.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

**How many paddles should you use?**

In my opinion if you aren't using all 4 paddles, you aren't maximizing your controllers ability. It can be very difficult to adapt to using paddles, and in particular most peoples small fingers are particularly weak and have no strength or endurance for long gaming sessions. However you can adapt, you just need time and patience. A lot of people just use jump and build on their paddles, however editing is such an important factor in gameplay and you can't rely on taking your thumb off of your joystick to do so. I also think editing with the right or left stick clicks can be incredibly awkward, so recommend the painful transition into the 4 paddles.

&amp;#x200B;

**What buttons to bind**

The reason for using paddles is obviously so that you do not have to take your thumb off of the right stick in order to push for example the A/X button to jump, allowing you to aim and jump at the same time. In my opinion, the obvious binds that need to be put on paddles are:

* Jump
* Build
* Edit &amp; Confirm Edit
* Reset Edit

This means the only time you have to take your thumb off of the right stick to to pickup weapons on switch to pickaxe, which aren't typically as aim sensitive.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to make the switch**

I would recommend starting using 2 paddles, and making your way up to 4 once you have acclimated to the first 2. I am going to go on the assumption that you are mapping the same functions as I have written above. So first, you should map the build and jump buttons to whatever paddles you are going to use. Generally getting used to moving by jumping with the paddles is the easiest to get used to, and the most useful, so this is why I recommend this first. For this I would recommend an hour of build (not edit) practice in creative a day. Learning to do 90's and the side jump with different build and jump buttons can be frustrating, but just drill those new motor patterns. This should take about 3 days before this becomes a lot more natural to you, you'll still fumble and press the wrong buttons when you panic, but I found that it took about 3 days to get about 80% of the way through. When you get to a stage where you don't have to think about these paddles, then I would add the other 2. Editing is something that is definitely difficult on a controller, but even more difficult and inefficient when not mapped to paddles. Doing Speedy's warm up editing course once or twice a day will drill these new key binds in, and it will take another 3ish days before you feel semi comfortable with these. I would say that it took me about 2-3 weeks from start to finish to truly feel the benefits of the paddles and get 100% comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

**What Functions to map to what paddles?**

For clarity, I use the xbox elite controller, as I came from playing xbox previously and bought this controller before I switched to controller on PC. Below I have added what fingers use each paddle, just for players who are thinking of getting a PS4 dualshock style paddle controller, just as I feel paddle choice is important. The paddles I use are:

* Upper Left (Ring finger) - Edit
* Lower Left (Small finger) - Jump
* Upper Right (Ring finger) - Reset edit / crouch
* Lower Right (Small finger) - Build

Originally I had these inverted in terms of upper and lower, so edits were on the bottom paddles, however with rapid editing practice during some creative edit courses my small fingers would get fatigued and they weren't able to keep up. So I would recommend binding less ""intensive"" buttons to the small fingers that you don't have to quickly press repeatedly, so jump and build were good options with edit and confirm edit being on the ring fingers. I should note that I also put the crouch button on the same paddle as confirm edit, as this is just a function that happens in edit mode, but you can map any other button to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps!

Imagine two pro players willingly contesting a spot as shit as Viking to fight two of the best in the world off spawn. 

In no way am I saying that I'm against players contesting other players drops, but contesting viking, solely because the top duo landed there, is a stupid play. We can all pretend that aimhero didn't know who was landing viking, but if they watched a single game in the vod, they'd have seen who it was. Zex isn't upset that they got contested because maybe another duo was already planning on landing viking, but that a duo contested such a shit spot just because they were number 1.

There's also all these hypocritical comments saying that they weren't griefing, but why wouldn't they contest the number 1 duo? You're literally saying that they shouldve contested them solely because they were number 1. 

This sub has gone to shit. Obviously there aren't going to be insane new tricks discovered and posted everyday, so I'm happy to see some good discussions on this sub.

The production of the event was incredible - light years ahead of anything we have seen previously. I loved seeing the players faces and names outside their cubicles, the stats showing who had the most kills, the constant real time updates showing the FULL standings.     
I also appreciate that ESL took feedback and clearly implemented it into Day 3 as I felt the viewer experience was the most polished. Obviously there is room to improve with this only being the first event - killfeed up at all times, less bird eye view and more POV especially when players are popping off ie Mitr0, Kamo &amp; Issa etc. There also needs to be a process whereby restarts are given until all players are in the lobby anything less is unacceptable with so much money on the line.     
The casters were so hype too - Balla stepped up and you could tell he was enjoying it so much. None of the interviews made me cringe they all felt natural and insightful. I didn’t actually mind the 10 min breaks and splitting the duos over two days to allow players to view VODs etc I imagine was immensely helpful for the players.

https://i.redd.it/ug7w6vw660k21.png

The Chug is one of the least reliable healing items in the game at the moment and is seldom carried by a player, especially into late game in non-squad formats. I propose a buff to rework this item.

&amp;#x200B;

The Chug would spawn with 2 charges instead of one.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of healing 200 HP/Shield, it would heal 100 HP/Shield instantly upon consumption. (i.e. if you are at 53 HP, you would go to 100 HP, 53 Shield).

Reduce the consuming time from 15 seconds to 7.5s per charge.

This would make finding the item feel rewarding and actually viable to carry into end game over a stack of med kits or slurps.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this looks like a pure suggestion, and I did post it to the main sub as one, but honestly a legendary heal item should be viable in carrying during competitive play. There's no reason for it to be extremely situational.",FortniteCompetitive

Chest loot i feel should only give weapons of blue rarity and above, NO green or grey weapons. Floor loot should consist of all rarities. As there are times where i beat someone to a chest to get a grey AR whilst the other guy picks up a purple pump, now breaking it down, I've effectively been punished for securing the chest before an opponent which shouldn't be the case.

In regards to a ranked playlist, I feel they should test this out in a pop-up cup where all weapons are of blue rarity and above, maybe even all the same rarity, that eliminates some aspects of RNG out of early game, which will incorporate more actual gun skill/building ability/editing in the early game. Watching ESL i saw a few times where someone who have a lesser rarity weapon get the jump on someone but be one shot by a gold/purple pump off spawn. I get this game is very RNG heavy but i do feel to send this game in to being an unchallenged competitive BR they need to find ways to eliminate SOME of the RNG.

They are considered a top 5 duo and have really struggled, and chap, I am not trying to be a dick, but honestly your gameplay and attitude the last few months has been Dogshit. You need to make a choice here, are you a steamer or are you a pro for liquid.

I am a huge liquid fan, and 72 is my favorite player, but chap is holding him back due to this stupid “twitch numbers/streamer mindset” I feel like lately all chap cares about is his support a creator code and his twitch numbers. Which is fine, but then he needs to accept the possibility of being replaced.

From their YouTube channel videos, the liquid owner/ceo seems very adamant about wining and what not so I can defiantly see chaps name in the discussion pool about possible being a bench player. I know he will read this and make fun of me and this subreddit, but it’s the truth. Daequan and Hamlinz got this exact hate so he should too. Chap buddy, I just want you to take the game serious again and be that elite duo with tom like you were the first couple of skirmishes. I am not trying to say you don’t have the talent, but as of now you just aren’t in the right state of mind. 

Again, I am not trying to start a which hunt, I just really want my favorite duo back on their peak performance levels. Idc about “drop spot getting removed” yeah yeah , I’m sure that has had an impact but you can’t tell me chaps attitude lately is not in a professional winning mindset. Liquid dropeed strafe quick for a better player, so anything should possible.

P.S. chap I still fuck with you you bot, you just making me mad.

203,franklyigiveadam,1551614463,awte63,31,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/awte63/can_we_talk_about_buffs/,44,Can we talk about buffs?,"I know that this subreddit tends to focus on nerfs/vaults, but I'd like to get the ball rolling on some potential buff discussion. I feel there's too many items that just don't serve an adequate purpose and nobody seems to be talking about them.

**PISTOLS**
In my eyes, this is the most glaring issue right now. Why isn't anyone talking about pistols? By far the most useless guns in the game. A grey AR will pretty much outclass a purple pistol in every way. I know pistols in video games aren't traditionally powerful, but why even bother having them in the game if they don't excel at anything? When looting, getting a pistol is pretty much as good as getting nothing unless it's ABSOLUTELY the only weapon you have.

**TAC SHOTGUN**
I dream of a world where players can define themselves as either pump players or tac players. Balancing the shotguns would make this game so much more diverse and interesting. Even most casuals recognize that while the tac is a bit more forgiving than a pump, it can't compare to the pump's one shot burst potential.

**CHUG JUG**
Hear me out here. Think about how many times you actually pick up a chug and carry it with you. It's a legendary item, but I personally don't feel like its as powerful as it's rarity might suggest. It takes so long, and is prone to being interrupted. Additionally, you only get ONE use, whereas every other healing item stacks. It's crucial to be able top yourself off after taking some poke damage. Chugs are just usually not worth the inventory slot, even though they should be the best healing item in the game. 

Agree or disagree? What buffs would you like to see? 

Sidenote: I didn't mention duelies, scoped/thermal AR's, or mounted turrets because I feel that simple buffs would not be enough. These items need more of a rework to be viable in my opinion.

In the end it just becomes background entertainment rather than something I actually watch intently. 

Imo it would be much more enjoyable if I could tune in to a particular streamer's stream to see just their perspective as they play out their games. Its fair to say that I have a vested interest in some more than others so the camera bouncing around chaotic builds is a little uninteresting. I'd be more interested to know how that player came to be where they are in the action and how they get out of various engagements alive than the random snippets of action that are always out of context. Then when they pan to a wide shot it looks like a favela with players scurrying about. 

What are the barriers to this being a thing? I guess advertising but on the flip side, if they stream from their stations and provide all the tournament overlays etc, sponsorships and placements would be much more valuable on the basis that each streamer has their own audience that will see the placements. 

As a controller player, I rarely watch pc pros these days because many of their play actions aren't possible for controller players. I'd much rather follow a controller pro end to end in a tourney as a point of reference for my own learning and development. ",FortniteCompetitive

The game is arguably in the best state it has been for seasons and somehow there is more complaining now than on P90 release day and building nerfs back in S5. 

Why would someone sit here at /r/FortniteCompetitive and say thigs like: ''This game never was and will never be competitive'', ''Yeah ths game is RNG Bugshit, that's why I quit a month ago''. If this game is so bad and too casual for you, why are you in this sub and why are you even playing the game to begin with?

I know that the new sounds aren't really un upgrade. I know that some people have performance issues even though I haven't noticed any on PC. I know that  ESL Katowice had serious issues but why do people feel the need to spread negativity and make 300 posts a day about 1 bug. I prefer having bugs in the game that can be fixed because no one benefits from them than have planes or zombies that have to stay in the game for months. Like, Epic already announced that they are working on the sound.

If anyone has played WoW and knows what their subreddit is like can find some pretty big similarties like feeling the need to constantly complain about something.",FortniteCompetitive

I played FPS games since 2008
- cs 1.6 ~ 6500k hours
- cs go ~ 3k hours 
Some Cod/BF 3,4,1 
-H1Z1 ~ 1000 hours 
In all these games i played for different teams on semi-pro level. 
My last game was H1Z1 and we knew that it is already dead or dying rn
You know why? - because their devs don’t listen the community
Every update they ruin current meta, trying to get skill gap lower. 
Devs wanted to get back their high online, and change possible and even impossible things to get this game noob-friendly. And from season to season i see, how fortnite is going down in all aspects of the game. They totally followed the H1Z1 way. 
They trying to keep the game look fresh for the audience to stay and play, its totally wrong. 
Look at all games, that are played for years, like cs dota and others. STABILITY is the most important thing in every game. Nowadays there is no stable BR game in the world
From this season this game start to lose their player-base. There is no any levels of ranks in this game, like MMR in dota or Rank in CSGO. So new players will always die, cuz every average player can build extremely fast and know all aspects of the game. Only strong will survive. Just imaging how much time you need to hotdrop and die to learn some aspects of the game??200 matches? 
If only i have better english....
DON’T WATCH ON OTHER BR GAMES, or you will die after world cup. You need stable ranked system for casual players to learn the aspects of the game, and for tryhards like us. From season 3 i saw only 1 update that improved the quality of the game

Basically, I've been a moba player for my entire life.  
Recently only moved to shooting games such as Fortnite etc etc, and because of how disgustingly fun fps / shooting games are more than mobas, I instantly fell in love.  
Of course Mobas require less mechanics and more knowledge than FPS which requires mainly mechanics, flicking etc rather than knowledge.  
Or so I think?  
That's why you're here, reading this, cuz I need you help.  
I'm so trash, this is literally the only way I can express it, I've never played a single shooting game in my life before fort, except some other game that I wont state maybe so this topic doesn't fall, etc but I had around 70 hours in it, which is incomparable to my 6000 hours + I've invested in mobas.   
Basically, I've been having so many questions so I will line them all up to all of you guys and I need everyone to answer this in every way possible, go ahead and troll if you want, not that much of a big deal to me but I am really looking for an answer.  


TL;DR, answer dem questions below:  


1- How hard does a mouse affect your aim?, I've been using the cooler master Lite S which is basically trash for such games, or is it not and the problem is surely in me?  
For anyone who has a godly mouse but has been playing with a trash one, how hard did changing into a better one affect your aiming?  
2-Refresh rates, is it really going to affect how better you see your enemy, react, do better in fights and building just because you have a higher refresh rate like 144, 165, 240Hz?  
How far can you go with 60Hz, actually does any pro player play with a 60hz monitor in this specific game?   
3-Best way to learn the game is through training aiming first or prioritizing building speed &amp; efficiency?  
Does Kovaak really help a lot regarding this matter?  
4-The last question.  
Is trying hard in Fortnite actually worth it, is competitive a good thing in this game or will it just fall and I'm better of spending this time trying to learn another game.  
In the end, It's just another shooting game where I believe, having a good aim in any of them can simply make you learn way faster in any other FPS game so that time is not really lost after all.

Back before shotguns got buffed the purple and gold pump fit well into the game. But since the buff they are insanely strong. A blue pump can already one shot someone with 200 hp, and can one shot someone off the drop with a body shot. do we really need two shotguns stronger than that? 

Epic recently made the game very balanced with the removal of gimmicky items and anti build mechanics, which is great. But now with the average player being pretty good and with the very limited ways to get through builds, most fights become 50/50 shotgun fights. and if you have a green pump and they have a gold one, you are screwed. 

It just seems to put more emphasis on rng, vs quality shots. Even a horrible player can land a 110 body shot. I could be the only one who feels this way but let me know what you guys think. ",FortniteCompetitive

Then Season 3 launched it was fun balanced and a good experience, then Season 4, it was fun but the Meta was extremely annoying but it was still fun. Then came the 3rd worst season in this games history, Season 5. with nothing but Smg based combat it was a nightmare of a season. Next season 6. Everyone was still recovering from the previous season but then we got the exsplosion meta, Tl;dr An Utter and absolute disaster.

Next season 7 in my opinion the 2nd WORST season in the game worse than S5, With nothing but third partying splodes and annoying metas and strategies IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (Notice a pattern yet)

Finally Season RnG, Splodes, Phase through builds and spam, oh wait i meant season 8. Like at this April fools has gone on too long. Like im really asking at this point, ""Can epic games do anything right"" (The answer is no) but its just ridiculous, in my opinion Smgs at this point should just be vaulted they are so annoying, ALSO EPIC SHOTGUNS ARE STILL BROKEN i hit a 6! point blank.

Controller player here.

I just switched from a standard xbox controller to an xbox elite controller and i couldn't be more frustrated.

Before I switched, I felt like I could win every game I played, battle anybody I ran across, and I moved through the map with my dick swinging.

I switched to the paddle controller today (left paddle jump) (right paddle switch mode) and I've been getting bopped by the biggest bots in this game and it's as if I'm learning how to walk for the first time I fucking suck.

I kind of want to just say fuckit and get rid off the paddle controller but I was curious how some of your guys' transitions went.

This is va1edictorian and I'm back with another post about improving as a competitive player. This time I'll be focusing on things that I have done to improve the efficiency of my practice. For any player that is looking to improve, whether it be to raise your win percentage or to potentially go pro at the game, practice is the key, so let's get into it!

In no particular order of importance:

1. **Pick a schedule that works for YOU.** Look we all get it, every single one of us that is playing the game competitively has priorities outside of Fortnite that we must attend to. Whether it be an education, a job, or even a family member to support, all of our schedules are EXTREMELY different and we must learn to become efficient with our time. For example, a person that can play the game for 8 hours a day has a LOT more time to dedicate towards micro-gameplay (things such as Kovaak's and editing maps) compared to a player that can only play the game 3 hours a day. Instead of holding your limited time or schedule as an excuse that ultimately tilts you (this is an external factor that you cannot control as mentioned in my previous post) you can focus on the time that you DO have and maximize it. Recently, people that are looking to improve at the game are told to play Kovaak's endlessly to get better aim or to build fight their friends and run edit courses until they can kill more people or win more games. Even though there are extreme benefits to practicing the ""micro"" part of the game, you have to understand that not everyone has the time to dedicate to this. The best advice that I can give a player that is struggling on finding time in their lives is to initially look at their priorities and see if they can make more time and then most importantly they should build a practice regime that is focused around what that player specifically needs to improve on.  
2. **Isolate your problems.** Tip #1 was getting a bit lengthy and essentially building a practice schedule that works for you involves finding your weaknesses and doing exercises that target those weaknesses. The main issue that I see when I look at my old gameplay and other players trying to improve is how they approach the mistakes they make. There is a massive difference in acknowledging your mistake and understanding why you made a mistake and a majority of players fail to do the latter. Here is an example scenario, you are in a scrim game with 40+ players alive at end-game and the circles start moving outside of the original zone. You attempt to build your way to the next safe zone because you have no mobility and you get edited on from above and you die. Tilted/average players will tend to blame their death on lack of mobility and RNG (this is a factor that caused your death but this is, yet again, an external factor that you cannot control and therefore cannot improve from). Good players will acknowledge the fact that maybe they could've hit their shot when the player above edited down or maybe they could've been quicker with their own edit and eliminated the player first. Great players, however, will not only understand the ""micro"" mechanical mistakes they made but they will also take a step back and think about what caused them to be in that position in the first place. Maybe there was an opportunity for an earlier rotation, maybe there was an opening where they could've eliminated a player mid-game and received mobility/mats, maybe they could've tracked potential players nearby while turtling up and accounted for them when attempting to rotate. Essentially, isolating specific problems instead of just saying that you died because you missed a shot or you failed an edit is how you can truly improve. This ""macro"" part of the game which involves rotations, a deeper understanding of when to take height, when to use mats, when to take fights, when to peek and take favorable shots is what sets the best of the best apart from the ""good"" players. Furthermore, you should not only be acknowledging the ""macro"" part of your game that you are struggling in but you should actively be looking for opportunities to improve on your weaknesses in games. I'm not saying that you shouldn't improve your mechanical skill, as it is a core part of the game, I just want to shed some light on how important the ""macro"" part of the game is and how players that are not known for their mechanical skill can still compete and be successful amongst the best players in the world because of how they have mastered this ""macro"" component.
3. **Play like you want to improve.** I know how tempting it is to Symfuhny edit your way down really quick and destroy a player that is completely unaware of their surroundings. The problem with this isn't that you have practiced and mastered a specific type of editing technique but it is that you have trained yourself to unconsciously approach a fight a particular way. Think about it, can you remember the last time you took a fight and genuinely remember the thoughts that were going through your mind as you fought? Were you focusing on specific mistakes that you made in the past and looking to improve on your weaknesses with no regard to if you died to a ""bot"" player or not? Most of us tend to approach each fight with the goal of eliminating the enemy player and to ultimately win (which is a logical goal to have in a BR) however, because this idea of ""winning"" and ""improving"" are so intertwined we fail to realize what we are actually doing in the moment and ultimately rely on our unconscious muscle memory to do whatever we have to do in order to win the fight. If you truly want to improve on a particular weakness that you have isolated, you must go into games with the mindset that you will improve at that PARTICULAR weakness, disregarding the idea of eliminating players or winning the game. Only then will you be able to truly isolate that weakness and be able to work on it. A player that does an excellent job of doing this is Symfuhny. If you tune into Symfuhny's stream, you will find that a majority of the time he will peek enemy players from the low-ground (knowing that he could easily take height and edit down to eliminate the player). This playstyle is often overlooked as him just ""trolling"" or not taking the game ""seriously"" because it is a random pub that has nothing on the line. This is simply not true. Look at his gameplay on a deeper, analytical level and you'll realize that essentially he is throwing the idea of winning/killing the enemy player out of the window and is completely isolating his low-ground peeking. By acknowledging the fact that in competitive tournaments, he might not always have the resources to take highground, and/or a player that already has highground will be able to maintain it, he is practicing for future scenarios in which his ability to win/survive will solely rely on his lowground shots. Even though there are many other components to the game, Symfuhny's ability to isolate parts of his gameplay and work on that make him an exceptional player. Ghost Kayuun also talked about this idea of improving by ""isolating"" parts of your game in his most recent video. By entering into a game with this ""isolation"" mindset you can not only improve your mechanical skill but you can also target your ""macro"" gameplay which will drastically improve how you play as a whole.

All of my posts tend to get lengthy but there is a ton of information that I want to get out there and I love making this type of content! I focused this post on the ""macro"" component of the game but I just want to clarify and say that the ""micro""/mechanical component is also very important. The reason I focused on the ""macro"" part of the game is because players are already finding ways to efficiently engage in improving their mechanical skill and I believe that ""macro"" improvements in terms of decision-making can take them to another level.

He always stayed one level higher than me cause everytime I thought i caughtup to him and pull out my gun to shoot him/place a wall he would build a floor higher again. I didnt want him to heal but i ran out of mats. I couldnt knock the build down too. In playgrounds when i take a shot and build up, thars different cause ik the player im playing against and we’re going building mode. But in pubs I literally dont know if the guy is a bot or not so i tend to stay on the same ground til he goes for highground so i do the same. Im not good at taking highground but i don’t understand how its possible to get get highground after u lose it (gotta keep an eye on mats and third party). Any decent player can keep a floor higher than u. This means i have 2 options. 1) let him heal up and play lowground and wait for him to aggress 2) try retaking high ground (gets laggy/he gets some free shots/can get knocked down/ and uses mats)

The sound is absolutely borked right now.  I continue to wonder how changes like this can make it through play testing and get signed off as ready to go.  Here are the issues I personally have had with the sound:

1. AR is way too loud.  Epic really needs to dial back the sounds in fortnite.  In general the sounds in this game just seem to be getting louder.  Just boosting certain sounds is not how you fix the spatial audio in this game
2. The gliders are very loud now.  The first couple of hours of playing i could not locate a single glider and i found out the reason for this was because i expected the guy to be right on me.  The glider noise is so loud now they sound as if they are landing on you when in fact they are a decent distance away.
3. Footsteps - one of the thing Epic said they were going to work on are the footsteps in the game, mainly differentiating between below and above.  Well they certainly made some changes here and they are BAD.  If someone is above you it sounds like they are running around with cinder blocks as shoes.  Its very hard to tell if they are right above you or 2 stories above you.  The sound is scarily loud.  On the other end of the spectrum are the below you footsteps.  They are really really soft are very hard to hear.  I think this why people are complaining about tracking issues in build fights.  Its extremely loud if someone is on top of you and way too soft if someone is below you.  I do not know how this gets through play testing with an A-OK ready to ship decision.
4. Because of the soft footsteps of anyone below you its very hard to hear someone coming up from behind you.  Multiple times throughout my games last night i was lasered by people who could not only run up from behind me but also build towards me without me having any sound notification whatsoever.  I found myself getting very frustrated and complaining how the 3rd partying is getting worse . . . . I realized thats its the same its always been .  . . . before this update you would have sound cues that you no longer have that would allow you to be aware someone was pushing from behind.
5. The pickax has an echo now when you pull it out.  Why is this in the game and how did this also make it past play testing.  The sound is extremely annoying and is also distracting.  Please why?

The sounds are def not the only issue with the game right now . . . 

1. Floor loot has been and still is horrible and i do not think i need to talk about this.  I am pretty sure this is well known
2. Environmental Rifts continuing to be removed is a major problem.  As far as i know they may have all been removed.  Rifts are the most balance way to rotate.  They make not only an audible noise when used they also have a visual indicator as well.  They are simple the most balanced rotational item that has ever been in this game.  I really think Epic should at least explain its reasoning for removing rifts

I know there are plenty of other issues to include but I can not think of them at the moment.  The one thing that is becoming more and more obvious is that Epic does not have the resources to fix the sounds themselves.  The sounds have been bad for a long time but now they are far worse.  Their attempts to fix sounds seem (because i truly do not know the amount of effort or work that went into fixing sounds in 8.0) lazy or require talent that is not currently available on the dev team.  If the second part to that sentence is the case i really hope they reach out and try to bring in someone with this kind of knowledge in to properly fix the sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic.  You really need to get away from pushing new content into the game on a weekly basis.  Clearly, (and this is very clear by now) this is not sustainable and is introducing more bugs and performance issues then your team can fix.  This is the time where you sit down and start to rethink your content approach to this game.  This game needs a ton of work and hiding it behind an early access banner for another 2 years is not going to work anymore.  Comparing this games optimization, sounds and performance to recently released BR game developed by a triple A company is night and day.  You have the money to hire the talent needed if the talent doesnt exist in house.  If the talent does exist in house you need to figure out how to free that talent up from working on new content and focus the team on polishing this game.

It seems anything that can counter turtles is hated by the comp community. People want clingers out now even though they aren’t hard to counter?? People also want the heavy snipe to not one shot walls. Not saying there should be splodes everywhere, but epic gave us spray weapons, deagles, various splodes, and brief world editing for pop ups. These were all hated by comp community which is fair, but there has to be a balance.

If he never made it into top 10 of the solo showdown this would have never happened.

What Aydan did was each solo showdown he would play them, and if he didn't get a good score he would unlink his epic account from his psn and relink a new one which would let him redo the solo showdown as many times as he wants. If your a long time competitive player you know you can only do solo showdown one time.

I was someone who wagered and did bot races on cmg a year ago, so I followed Aydan for a while before he was ever famous, he was an amazing player back then and godly.I lost a couple 100+ wagers to him. I watched him attempt each solo showdown and he would reset his score 3-5 times every time till he got an amazing score. 

I made top 100 solo showdown as well but never got a chance to compete because I was only top 40 in each one. If I had a chance to retry I believe I could of easily made top 10 if I did what he did.

They really messed a lot with the mobility this season. Geysers are pretty much an OP 3rd partying machine. And i don't know how i feel about cannons yet tbh. But from the looks of it, it doesn't seem like Epic wants to reach a good balance each season, but rather just go with the theme and throw those theme based items across the map, doesn't matter how they affect balance. People thought they removed planes for balance, when in reality, they removed them so they can throw the new theme around the entire map, cannons and geysers.

&amp;#x200B;

Can't Epic just stick to one balanced way of mobility ? or are they just going to keep messing with them each season depending on the theme ? it kinda saddens me seeing rifts being removed one by one each season when they were the most balanced form of mobility ever added to fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

2. However, they removed rifts from at least 5 areas (at the edge of the map) that I've seen which makes rotations from those areas super tedious. Especially Viking, since you now have to build down a mountain. I know some areas have quadcrashers and vents close by but those are much more tedious than rifts. I hope that either the vents become more common or they introduce a new way of rotations. The cannons do provide a way but positioning them before you climb into them is just annoying. Plus they removed some ziplines I don't know why.

3. So happy about the chillers being vaulted I gave it it's own point.

4. POI CHANGES. ailing has a special place in my heart but it was kind of dead. Very few people went there and I personally didn't like endgames there. Sunny Steps looks ok. Lazy Lagoon is fun. Volcano has a little lesser loot than I'd like.  will definitely miss motel (partly again for the rifts). I was hoping for more of a change to the ice biome but I'm ok with that for now. Plus it may change later on in the season.

5. I like the pinging system.

5. Performance. The game feels the laggiest it's been in a while. A lot of fps drops and hitches with movement and building. Definitely needs to be streamlined a little more. 

6. Audio. Why epic? Just why? The audio wasn't perfect by any means at all. We asked for vertical audio, not messing up every sound in the game. ARs sound absolutely horrible. When I'm farming wood and hit the red dot the sound is like punishment to my ears (I've literally see farming like that just to avoid hearing it). The sound for someone's shield breaking sounds like 29193 China cups smashing on my head. Even the pinging audio cues sting. The new pump equip sounds like my pump has 10 metal parts loose in it. Absolutely hate the audio updates. Want them to revert every single one. Directional audio does seem a teensy bit better but idk. Just give me back my normal sounds. 

Personal thoughts: I actually prefer the game in the 7.40 patch state compared to this, but I'm inclined to give epic time to fix the issues, even though they should've been tested pre release. I feel that it's sad that the things I've been most pleased with are nerfs or vaults and not new additions. There's hasn't been a good new thing for so long (except the hoverboards). I feel like they removed rifts and some ziplines just randomly without thought which annoys me. I wish they'd add no new things and take 2 3 months to fix stuff first. But I know that's asking for way too much. So I just hope they fix some of the current issues as soon as possible while adding whatever their stoned game devs can come up with. 

Peace 🤞

But creating not only restricted areas that are not accessible late game for rifts to spawn, but contested waypoints that are worth fighting for increases mid game fights and the value of places like Viking, Racetrack etc (Viking essentially being useless now as it rarely gives mobility) as early game drop spots.

Minis, big shields and bandages are the most common consumable drop. Rarity was weird before patch but now looks more correct with a linear decresce in availability with greater rarity. [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYJ0eQdB99IaKt5FH1hUeQO-ZEFzmxjUOjsC9cTAxNQ/edit#gid=0)

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours before servers went down I decided to test some drop rates to see what epic changes without telling us via patch notes. Not much.. at least on this patch.

Season 7:

*Processing img sd5vlnptocj21...*

Season 8:

[n = 100](https://i.redd.it/u25n8wbvocj21.png)

You can see that AR and SMG are most common drops along side with the Infantry Rifle. 

&amp;#x200B;

My data also show that the changes on assault rifles rarity didn't change too much since the difference between the patchs was negligible.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5r53i2q4pcj21...*

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest change was in rarity availability since in S7 got more epics and rares than uncommons, season 8 the distribution is more linear with greater rarity becoming less available.

https://i.redd.it/4jrjjkugpcj21.png

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With an data size of 100 I think it's too small to evaluate something concrete but in my opinion Infantry rifle should receive a nerf to the drop rate. ~~I also think there is SBMM loot drops /s~~",FortniteCompetitive

I feel like console would be at an even bigger disadvantage with turbo building gone, so that is fine how it is.

Now, why do I think turbo building on PC should be removed? Just think back to the early seasons of Fortnite when Myth was considered the best builder, and any small little build fight was clipped and considered incredible. Those were simpler times. Now think to the present day. Everyone has gotten better at the game, obviously, however what is the one thing that every sweaty player/pro player does constantly...build. Back before turbo building was a thing, build fights were very rare because it took a decent amount of skill in order to do it. (I know in today’s meta it might not be the best to remove turbo building because of the TTK, but I digress). The majority of people who hate this game hate it because either of the weapon balancing issues or because of the sweaty players who only build because that’s all you need to do to take out a no-so-great player, out build them. But now, it’s SO DIFFICULT to be a new player in this game, even if there is skill based matchmaking, because many people create starter accounts to fight against newer players. What I’m trying to get at here is that if they removed turbo building from PC, the game would be less sweaty and toxic, and it would just allow for more strategic plays and awesome clips to be made in the community. This is just my opinion. Thx for your time. Let me know what you think!",FortniteCompetitive

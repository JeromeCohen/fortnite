But hear me out, anything that makes renders an item or in this case MULTIPLE ITEMS (Rip telling my team I have a launch pad and hearing them get excited) should be reviewed and reconsidered.

Seriously why are we not talking about this more.
I obviously can’t speak for anyone else but do you like having someone glide away in a fight as soon as you get the advantage?

A game mechanic that is crucial in fortnite is FALL DAMAGE, you should always be punished for building to excessively or with little support. Again my opinion: The main thing that makes fortnite stand out from other battle royales is the building aspect, other than that it’s just a gears of war esc shooter. And it’s starting to feel like that more and more with all these changes.

I know you guys barely care about the opinion of PROS because this is a casual sub but, each one of them will agree that it’s a horrible mechanic, we’re seeing up to 80 people in the final circles opposed to before around 60-50.

The STORM is made for bringing people closer in the battlefield and punishing those that prolong engagements. Why would we need something that does the opposite. Believe me or not I won a few games with no shotgun, as soon as they came close I just glided away and spammed 3 scars, laughing the whole time as to how disgusting this change is.

I know a lot of people also don’t like to bring up the fact that this removes a huge chunk of the SKILL GAP in fortnite between a smart builder and a spam builder.

I don’t like talking about myself either because it rarely helps in getting the point across, but you have to understand that I am not a bad player (at least I think so) I have a 20% solo winrate (slowly increasing), and with this new implementation I can just build whatever I want, and I can assure you from my experience that I’m becoming more and more careless (keep in mind I’m not struggling, winrate is still going up) but I’m trying to say that there’s no point in learning to build any sort of protective structure when you can just glide (Just glide lol) you seriously don’t need a shotgun in fact if you have good mats you can just stack splodes and use a sniper and AR. (Seriously hate talking about my play but I had to give an example).

If you’re not going to remove it at least make it a separate game-mode like before.

Jokes are fun and all but it’s been over a week We need good feedback on this.

Actual line from their news: ""We would like to continue with this functionality in the game based on the positive results we’ve been seeing"".

There are so many positive experiences to be shared. The issue with it however, is not that theres to much to complain about, but it's because nobody shares the positive experiences. Until now.

You see, I enjoy sorting by new from time to time on many subs. But it is most frustrating seeing a surplus of complaint posts. All everybody wants to do is complain. No matter what change is made to the game, be it positive or not, this sub finds the worst in it. Heres one recent example...

- Fortnitemares. We were all so hyped about fortnitemares. Then the zombies were added. You see, there were so many positive things about them and only one negative point(that I come to find.)the positive being easy shields, early game loot, meds and the fun of something new. The negative being they were a pain late game. And instead of being civil about it everybody went off the walls complaining how stupid they were. It was frustrating seeing such a new and unique addition(limited time I will add) getting bashed for one issue. I get it's hard to adapt to 20 zombies on your tail end game but that was the fun of it. It was something new and unique. 

The complaining is unbearable and even after this beautiful event that happened only yesterday people are complaining about how it was a waste of their time, it could have been better, and my personal favourite, ""they shouldn't have even had anything happen."" 

 So I would just like to ask you this. Why do we keep coming back? Theres so much negativity about the game, but what makes us crave to continue playing? If you complain about it so much stop playing it. But we cant. Because we are loyal to epic and the game is to special and one of a kind. Tell me another battle royale game that hosts huge in game events like these. Name another battleroyale game that came up with the building concept. You cant. And that's the beauty of it all. 

So please, if you dont mind taking less than 5 minutes out of your day, let's all spread the positivity this game has bestowed upon us. 

TL/DR:Stop complaining over the game and share some POSITIVE experiences. 

Thank you for your time.",FortNiteBR

As far as I can tell, nearly every single possible comment I've seen that expresses any dislike for the redeploying system can be summed up in a single sentence:

***""I hate third partying""***

Are there any legitimate reasons for the hate?

You can't just vehemently hate a system that is overwhelmingly beneficial to the core gameplay simply because you hate losing because you played poorly.

Allow me to explain, most everyone loved 50v50s, then a lot more people loved Soaring 50s. That LTM was around for weeks, perhaps months (awful memory over here); most everyone loved it way more than regular 50s I'd say. So why is it that when that same mechanic is brought over it is seemingly and suddenly unanimously hated?

Third partying. The only complaint I've ever seen is not people disliking the feature itself. It isn't people hating the ability to move around the map faster, actually it seems no one talks about that. The only thing people talk about are how boring it is to get into a build battle and win and then get ""third partied"" or to be in a build battle and people just fly away.

That's not a justified defense and its frankly a terrible argument. It's a strategic choice to take out a weakened enemy given you have a higher chance of victory. It's a strategic choice to cut your losses, run away and lick your wounds. 

**If you're that upset about people running from a build fight. Chase them.**

**If you're that worried about being third partied, either build yourself a safe place while you heal or, build less, conserve resources and make yourself less obvious to more groups.**

Redeploy should be left as it is. Any changes just gimps it and at that point, it should just be removed. It's fine as it is, people just need to stop complaining about third partying and learn to adapt to their situations.

**TL;DR Is the only reason people hate redeploying gliders seriously just because of third partying? If not, please do tell me why you dislike it.**",FortNiteBR

We didn't need anymore means of moving around the map faster.
We had Quads, ATKs, grapplers, launch pads, Balloons, Port a rifts. How many ways is enough?

That and gliding is ruining any sort of fight you get into. 
Earlier I had somebody rush me, I didn't even know he was there (because I was shooting at somebody and the audio is so damn loud on everything except footsteps) and he build like 3 stories next to me before even attempting to shoot at me, I managed to quickly build up to him and the second I got up to him, he just glided away, so I chased him and he died instantly after spam building for an entire minute. 
Next game I had somebody ramp rush me, initiate a build battle and then bail on the battle and glide away they second I managed to get close. So I chased him down and got into another build battle with him then 4 different people from different angles started building into the battle. 
3rd partying is bad enough but 4 other people? It's just bad.

The community is so indecisive about what they want that epic doesn't have a clue what should and shouldn't be added and end up catering to bad players. Then the good players start using the bad mechanics and it turns crap. 
After like 3 games I just have to go off because of how annoying things are.

#Highground and ""Instant Highground items""

It first started with the addition of the grappler, and how someone could use it for quick high ground with low risk. thankfully, they eventually lowered the total number of uses. and while this change was beneficial in THAT build of the game, its not with the current version. 

Originally, the grappler was the ONLY Item someone could use for instant high ground, so when they dropped the usage number from 15 to 10 it became less effective in that regard, HOWEVER, with the recent addition of balloons, that is not the case. Now that balloons are in the game, the grappler is no longer the only item that grants an ""instant high ground advantage"", meaning the grappler usage nerf is obsolete. let me give an example. 

#Example 1

Lets say you are in a building fight 30 units up and you get knocked off, now you can simply float up to your desired height from a distance and grapple over to the surface, in the end leaving you with 15 balloons and a grappler with 9 uses left + the advantage of surprise since balloons are relatively silent after inflation. meanwhile, before the addition of balloons, you would need to be almost directly next to some sort of surface to grapple on to and grapple all the way up while giving away your position due to the high noise. by the time you get to the top, you are left with ~5 or fewer uses in your grappler and at a fair disadvantage since the other player could hear what direction you were coming up from and prepair to defend. 

#Fall Damage

Another aspect of the game that has been made almost completely obsolete is fall damage. get shot down? Just deploy your glider. need to get to the bottom of a building/hill FAST? just use 3 balloons and your good. I feel like a good way to fix this is by 1 - making it so you can only deploy your glider If you yourself **jump** off the surface. this way if you shoot down someone they still take fall damage, however if they need to make a quick escape from the storm they can still do that without needing a launchpad.

#Transportation overall

Currently, numerous items are completely pointless to use since their objectively better counterpart is just as easy (if not easier) to find.
the first one being shopping carts. What's the point in using one of those if almost every named location has an ATK or Quadcrasher in or around them? The second item is launchpads. Before these recent updates, launchpads were still a viable option to use (even with glider redeploy) because they gave you a height bonus for using them. Now, all you need is some balloons and you can go as far as you want. here's an example.

#example 2

lets say you land at junk to get decent loot and 999 metal. OH NO! the circle ended up in paradise! before the balloon update, you could build up a few times and glide there. It seemed like a pretty balanced system since you had a fair chance at getting to the circle while still needing to use up materials in the process. Now, you can use 5-6 balloons to get to the max build height and then glide there, while still keeping all your precious mats. 

""yEaH bUt YoU nEeD tO fInD bAlLoOnS fIrSt!11!!!!1!1!""

sure, in order to do this you need to find balloons first, however this is an incredibly easy thing to do since they have a decently high droprate and can be found almost anywhere. 

Here is my solution to these issues - 

#balloons

Lower the balloon drop count from 20 to 10, however allow players to carry a maximum stack of 15

Remove the ability to redeploy your glider while floating with balloons

Lower the rarity from epic to Rare

Lower the max balloons you can use at once from 6 to 5

As a way to keep Balloons relevant in a new way, allow players to use single handed weapons while using balloons (Pistol, deagle, grenades, clingers, boogie bombs, stink bombs and shockwaves)
However, bloom works like this while doing so - 

1 balloon = standard hipfire, however you are allowed to scope in still

2 balloons = 5% more bloom with hipfire and scope in, throwables go 5% less far

3 Balloons = 10% More bloom with hipfire and scope in, throwables go 7.5% less far

4 Balloons = 15% More bloom in both hipfire and scoped in - throwables go 10% less far

5 Balloons = 17.5% more bloom with hipfire and can only scope when holding still, however when holding still FSA Is enabled, followed by normal bloom. Throwables cannot be ""Thrown"" - they are dropped below the player

#Transportation

Vault Shopping carts 

As stated before, glider re-deploy can only be used when you JUMP

#Changes to ""Highground advantage weapons""

Increase overall grappler range

referance the balloons changes for more

**TLDR- The current balance of utility weapons is very off, making ""Instant Highground"" a massive problem - 
The current state of Transportation items seems to be overlooked, and with the addition of glider redeploy, balloons, quadcrashers and ATK's Shopping carts are completely useless and Balloons + Glider Redeploy is one of the most broken ""Mechanics"" of this game - 
Balloons are broken and need a massive change (Honestly i recommend you read the changes list to understand what changes i think should be made""

You get 100 XP for top 10 or 20, 200 for second (i think) and 300 for first. You get 238 XP max for 14 minutes after the first circle. So if we do squads thats a shit ton of XP and with pretty much no hassle.

Typically less skilled players will run and land on you non-stop before having time to heal from other fights.There's also plenty of movement in the game with shadow cubes, port a rifts, grapplers, icers, ATKs, and Quadcrashers.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
That being said, I do like redeploy in competitive because it helps with the RNG of circles and most pros won't just land on your head and risk their tournament game on it. The problem is the game can't be balanced solely around competitive. But I do think there's some good compromises here.  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
1) Limited amount of Redeploys, maybe 1-3 per match. Try to lessen the running and landing on in pubs while also still having the advantage of alleviating circle RNG in competitive.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
2) Redeploy only works outside safe zone. This would result in more running and people landing on you than the first option, but lessen it overall and again still keeps the benefit of redeploy for rotations.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
3) Redeploy is removed, but it does work off of balloons. This means you can gain the advantage of more redeploys while using balloons, but you have to give up a slot for it. Balloons are also a bit riskier to redeploy from since you float up slowly.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
4) Reward redeploys for kills. You start a match with 1 redeploy, but you can gain additional redeploys for every 2 kills you get. Those numbers could be tinkered with, but it rewards aggression and still gives 1 redeploy to help with the first circle RNG.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

In my opinion it makes the game not fun and everyone can just run away from fights including myself. 

So yesterday I got on for the event only to play. I haven’t played since they added the feature. The event was great I must say but then I was reminded of the feature and I wanted to throw up. 

So yesterday I played duos with my friend. I landed at fatal fields yesterday.  I collect my chests and notice another duo group landed with us. I also notice I got balloons and thought that was a cool add on but still I’m lost why make redeploy gliders when you have so many transportation items and vehicles. So we kill that duo group and right away we hear more people gliding in from lucky landing. We fight them and killed them pretty quick but they almost killed us because we were fighting the first duo group. 

After killing both duo groups, another group just glides in from the gas station south east. We finally die. It was so annoying. Someone is always in the Sky now. 

Next game we’re playing and I’m fighting this guy and next thing you know he just flies away. He uses a grapple and just flies far away and he was almost dead. I didn’t have anything to chase him so I build ramps up and someone is knocks it down when I’m high up. So no penalty and no worries, I fly down safely and kill that guy. A few seconds later another group flies in on me and I’m dead. 

 This game literally makes me sick. Everyone is either flying all around, flying in on people to sandwich others, and yet they keep adding items to transport. No penalty to building high, I’m better off just making sky bases for now on and winning or stay up in the sky with a balloon to reach first place so I don’t get third party by another team.

I loved this game but till this is removed I won’t be playing. I agree on most add ons... except the explosive radius thing idk what ya was thinking about that. ",FortNiteBR

I went to the STW subreddit and found out how bad the state of the game is, and it's not even moderated by EPIC! I know we love BR, but I can't believe that Epic lays a facade of support and care for the community with BR, but since nobody is looking, they neglect the STW community and are completely unresponsive to most requests and feedback. We get our bugs fixed in a day? There are some bugs in STW that have been there since 3.2, and further back- it's so sad too since it's the game that birthed BR. Why should we as a community not care about STW? *I ask of you today to speak up, even if you're not a player, for STW, since it's so hypocritical from Epic to care for one and not the other just for the cash*. Because it's not that nobody plays STW, we're just ignored. I'm posting here because I feel any statement in the STW sub will be ignored, and maybe if you guys listen and chime in we can actually manage to change something for the better in STW as well! Thanks for reading, and maybe give STW a chance! The community deeply cares for the game, and you'll find there's a lot to have fun with. But Epic needs to change something in order to keep it's project alive!

3-Getting shot at, panicking and building a pyramid (50v50 and yes builder pro lmao)

I get that it has its negatives, being third partied etc. But let’s not forget it’s being tested at the moment and the mechanics of the redeploy could change (I liked the suggestion of not being able to dive as much so you’re more of a sitting duck/harder to third party).",FortNiteBR

Everybody playes Fortnite from your favorite rapper to your neighbor but being such a big game there are some really CRUCIAL things that are missing for example: Spray Patterns for different weapons, Offline Battle Royale and Community Made Maps. Fortnite has a big competitive scene and you just can deny it but for such a big competitive game why is there still BLOOM in it? I mean BLOOM is a great thing but only for SHOTGUNS and not for guns that have SPRAY PATTERNS. BLOOM makes the game so much more RNG and not fun since every battle you get into with a AR or a SMG is basically a “who has more luck” battle there is 0 skill involved just luck. 
OFFLINE BATTLE ROYALE 
Epic Games should really implement an OFFLINE gamemode with 99 bots with custom difficulty settings so that players could get better and train without having to sacrifice their K/D or their WIN RATIO. But some people may say “we already got PLAYGROUND why would we need another practice gamemode?” My explanation is simple cause in PLAYGROUND you can practice different situations that happen to you in normal gamemodes like SOLO
COMMUNITY MADE MAPS 
Fortnite has one of the biggest community with some creative builder but why can’t we share out PLAYGROUND builds? We are limited to 60mins and after that our hard work is gone. No showing and letting other people test our stuff out. 
This is just my opinion on what should be added to the game to make it more COMPETITIVE and LESS RNG . Feel free to comment and leave suggestions or improvements ",FortNiteBR

I decided to live a simple life so I bought a small wooden boat and everyday for a year I sailed to a secluded island with nothing but a few bricks and some 4x4s and slowly built my house in the island.

It was a beautiful house and the island had a small cave which I renovated into a small storage section. Everyday I would sail to the land go to work buy food from the local farm then go home. It was peaceful. Then sadly the farmer died and the farm was replaced by a resort. It was a nice holiday location but this meant I had to travel far to get my food from the other farm a few miles away.

Then one day there was a storm. It was purple instead of white and this giant cube just appeared sat still for a few hours rolled around for a month then turned my serene lake into a bouncy castle. I didn't leave my island for weeks and survived on a carton of eggs. 

A few days later my house started flying. With me still in it. What the? A couple weeks go by and boom my house just blows up and turns into a community garden. 

This is why I hate Fortnite. Destroyed my house and killed bonesy in the explosion. Can I get an F for bonesy.",FortNiteBR

""The Sack""-Could just flex, like the flipping incredible emote.

The problem with female american football players in Fortnite is that it's a current issue between men and women. The NFL is composed of all male players. If you think I'm being sexist, there are many examples as to why women can't be in the NFL unless they have super human strength. Imagine this, a female is in the NFL and runs a vertical route.

(Certain things are quieter and louder which is throwing the balance of sounds off). Night looks even shitier. Radeon settings is iffy with the game now, for me to have it work I need to switch to windowed then back to fullscreen. 

So many little issues that just weren't an issue last patch. 

Can we go back and try again?

Edit - Post kinda blew up so more detail from the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7xq0ih/patch_250_undocumented_changesbug_megathread/?sort=top). 

**Performance**. I'm encountering a bit of stuttering (could just be server load), with a 120 fps cap my gpu temps are now about 5-10 degrees higher than last patch. Highest fps achieved with my settings was 270-280 in the main menu. Now it's back down to 250-260. Around about a 20fps decrease. (Specs - i7700k @4.8 / 290x) I use Radeon settings, 120 fps frame limiter and enhanced sync. The profile will not be picked up by the game unless I window and then back to fullscreen . This was not an issue last patch. People are also reporting input delay/lag now.

**Visual**. The colours look really off, items on the ground are pretty hard to distinguish. I actually couldn't tell the difference between a blue and purple sniper without mousing over it to read it. Whatever the colours looked liked last patch. Was nice, this isn't nice. I don't know how to explain that any further.

**Sound**. Everything seems a little quieter to me. Except for guns. The sounds don't feel balanced, things are either too loud or too quiet. I feel I either hear no one rushing me or everyone rushing me. No one building or everyone building etc.

This, after having dealt with the embarrassing downtime and friend list issues? Do you actually test your patches before you release them?

1. Lag
On my PC i get 300fps average and my internet speed tested on speedtest .net is 100+ mb/s. BUT i still lag in game. What i mean by lag is, i press E to pick up a weapon, it doesnt show up in my inventory for about 3 seconds. Another common lag i get is with building. I'll click to build and it takes 2-3 seconds for the building to even show up on my screen. THIS CANNOT be my fault. I have 3ms and 300fps. 

2. Bloom
We can all agree bloom is shit and makes the game way too rng. I myself am not too shabby at pc shooters and when i put a cross hair on an enemies head i expect atleast the first motha fukin bullet to hit them but instead it takes 20-30 shots to land one fucking headshot. 

3. Desync/low bit rate?
I build a wall. Get shot 3 times when standing behind that wall.
I peak, and then get back into cover, then get shot through my fuckin cover. 
I used to play H1Z1 and ""desync"" was a problem they had for a long time. If you dont know what that is, its like you peaking around a corner then hiding back behind where you peaked from and you think youre in cover but because of desync the enemy player sees you still peaking. 

I love fortnite so much and lately its really been getting on my nerves. I love frequent additions into the game but i really want the game to be in its best form before adding new stuff.

At the games current state i cannot play at competitive level. And yes i know this game is supposed to be fun, but fun for me is winning games because im good, not because im flipping a coin between each shot i shoot.

[Pertaining to change of rules for the S3 Battle Pass]","This sudden change in rules is absolutely outrageous. I don’t spend much money in games, but I figured that I would just go ahead and buy the S2 Battle Pass. I was saving my V-Bucks up (and I assume others within the community were as well) to buy the next battle pass until Epic decided to state that they will be bought with real money.

I was disappointed to say the least but whatever; it’s their game and they can do what they want with it.

So I spent my extra V-Bucks earned from my pass on an emote and two tiers. Now fast forward nearly a month later and we are told that we can buy it for 950 V-Bucks. Are you kidding me?

Was telling us that the future pass would have to be bought with real money some kind of ploy to get us to spend all our V-Bucks so that we would have to buy the pass all over again? I feel cheated and actually pretty much like I was played. The change of rules (I felt) was dirty as hell and left a sour taste in my mouth as I had plenty of V-Bucks to spend for the next pass.

I know people who have $10-$20 to throw at the game will likely downvote me and call me broke or poor or something, but that’s not the point. If the pass was still money purchase only, I would not feel nearly as salty as I do now. I just can’t believe Epic really pulled something like this.",FortNiteBR

The most I can get is 3 in a game and I usually get none but theres a fair amount of times I get one or two if I’m lucky. Whenever I go to tilted towers I die almost instantly. Whenever I go anywhere else almost nobody is there and in the chance I do see someone they probably will kill me first. I want to get better at 1v1s and I really want to get a solo win. I spent a massive amount of games trying to hide and camp but I can’t get better if I do that and I will never get a good amount of kills that way. For those of you who were literally complete and utter trash for a while, how did you get really good? I want to get as good as I can quickly and get a solo win soon.

1.  Give it a 3 story tall smoke stack.  This will alert nearby enemies of its use and make placing it far more interesting/exciting.

2.  Increase duration to 75 seconds.  Right now, it doesn't last long enough for counter play.  You rarely see people using it, and on the off chance you do, it's basically impossible to reach it while there's any healing left.  75 seconds would allow more interesting plays to develope. 

3.  Decrease heal rate to 3hp every 2 seconds.  The duration buff makes 2hp per second too powerful.

Right now, the Cozy Campfire has next to no risk with decent reward.  Lets make the risk reward interesting!

My issue is my hands are small, I cannot reach specific keys, I already played around with different key bounds including some streamers keybinds and some ones for noobs and I just can't my fingers hurt of all the stretching.

My biggest issue is that I don't know what key to press with my pinky finger and the thing is that when I use pinky to hold shift some how I let go when I move my ring finger. I feel more comfortable not using my pinky finger at all and instead using my ring finger to hold shift and to keep running, but the issue with this is that I only have my index finger free, as my middle finger is holding W so I can't press numbers 1,2 or 3 without letting shift go.

Anyone who is good at the game and has small hands like me? If I hold shift and try to reach the F' keys I cannot reach, is impossible. 

Would my only solution be to use a gaming mouse with multiple side buttons to replace the F keys and numbers 1,2,3? If so what mouse do you guys recommend me since I see a lot but I don't see which one if for my needs.

Listen, one of the big controversies on this sub is the price of skins, mainly it being the $20 skins. A lot of people think these prices are a little high, but I in fact understand why these prices are set at this.

The rare skins go for $20 because they are in fact, supposed to be rare. What's so rare about a skin that cost $5-$10 (in my case, USD) that most likely the whole lobby will own and have, where is the rarity in that? I, for one, enjoy the fact knowing I'm some of the minority that own these rare skins, and without any shame, I love being able to show off in the lobbies, and just show off overall, that's why we buy them anyways.

They offer skins that go for anywhere between 800-1500 V bucks as well, offering skins for people that do not necessarily want to buy $20 skins. (Emotes, pick aces, etc also).

As an adult too, I'm not going to try to say I'm a rocket scientist or a wall Street business man. But these prices are set at these prices for a reason. I for one wouldn't feel so 'rare' if these rare skins were like $10, because everyone would have it! 

I think k this community takes not having loot boxes for granted. I'll gladly pay $20 if it means I'm guaranteed getting  the skin I want, instead of gambling on a bunch of say, $5 loot boxes. REMEMBER, epic didn't make this game purely out of the kindness of their heart, they are a business!

They are 2v2 but played in squads mode. You join a squad with other two players, and then it is just a kill race. Whoever finishes with more total kills wins.

I love this structure and think all competitive battle royals should use kills as the metric for winning and not who is the last alive. As it stands, rewarding players for hiding until the last fight just makes the competitive scene boring. No one wants to watch them avoid fights for 30 minutes. We want to see 10 teams of pros fight it out in tilted and ninja flying across the map wiping squads. Aggressive play should be rewarded.

I also think this structure would succeed in a competitive online mode. Whoever gets the most kills in a lobby gets higher elo, regardless of their placement. Let’s face it, the guy who gets a 3 kill first place isn’t better than the guy who gets a 15 kill second place, he’s just ok with being bored for 20 minutes while the aggressive player wants to play the game. 

Now I know the argument against this will be that the game is about survival, and I still think survival would be important with a kill count system. It would be extremely difficult to get the most kills if you all die in the first location with 40 left. In solos, you might win tilted and have 10 kills but if you die with 35 left you are probably still going to lose. Being alive in the late game is still important. It would only reward smart-aggressive play, not stupid play. You’d see teams figure out ways to get more engagements without taking too many risks, which would be awesome. 

What are your thoughts on a kill based competitive structure? Would this be the way that epic would have to implement skill based matchmaking? ",FortNiteBR

Now ive defended double pump numerous times, and contrary to popular belief I don’t use double pump because im bad. Now im no myth or daequan or ninja. But I like to think that im average and sometimes slightly above that. I defend double pump because I find it fun to use. I play games to have fun majority of the time and if something makes a game more fun im likely going to use that.

Is the double pump powerful? Yes. Does it allow you to shoot faster than youre intended? Yes. Does that make it OP? Most people would say yes, and to an extent I do say yes. But its not always OP. A bad player who tries to use double pump isnt gonna be OP. We have all encountered potatoes in this game and we all know that even if they used double pump they still wouldnt be a problem. Thats why I don’t think double pump should be nerfed. All these clips on reddit that show the double being OP are all great players. In most cases the average player isnt gonna be wiping squads solo with double pumps. Sure it’ll happen every now and then but its probably not gonna be a reoccurring thing. To summarize good players will destroy with anything, and all these clips of the double pump being op are from good players.

Now obviously the double pump will be changed. We don’t know how yest but we do that a change is coming. And I do and do not have a problem with the double pump being changed. I don’t have a problem with it being nerfed because if the dev team sees it fit to change an exploit so be it. I do have a problem with it however because to me it seemed like the dev team didn’t care about changing until ninja devoted a large portion of his platform to getting it nerfed (no offense to ninja  he didn’t do anything wrong). It worries me that they are changing it because they are doing so because so many people cried about it. Thats the part I don’t like. Because now people are gonna think that if they cry about something enough that they can get anything changed to their liking. I wouldnt have a problem if the devs came out on their own will and said hey we’re changing double pump because its broken.Instead of ninja begging and pleading for it to change and for  adev to say something about it. Also I don’t mean to only address ninja here like I said he hasn’t done anything wrong hes just the biggest face in the community. There are PLENTY of people who complain about double pump.

My biggest gripe about everyone complaining about double pump though isnt that its gonna be changed or nerfed. Its that because all this attention is being drawn to double pump its taking away from all the other bugs in the game. For example the speed glitch which allows players to run faster than normal. The building bug where you cant build anything at all, which can cost games. A lot of times when players land in tilted towers and try to equip a gun the game simply wont let them. Another “exploit” thats not very talked about is the double revolver. It can be just as OP as double pump but because its not as popular as double pump its not addressed. Basically this is me crying to the devs saying “Hey theres other problems besides double pump.”. Im not trying to tell them to prioritize some bugs over others except maybe the building one thats kinda of a big one.

To summarize all of this, I don’t care that double pump is being changed/nerfed, I would just like the dev team to only change the game for the better and to make changes because theyre good or necessary not because people cried about it. And I would like people to see and address other bugs and not just one because someone with a large following doesnt like it.",FortNiteBR

In my experience, this is the superior playstyle (especially for newer players) and I’d like to go into why this is and how you can capitalise on it to get your first (or higher) win. Bear with me while I meander listlessly through my thoughts and feel free to give your opinion on why I’m wrong after.
 

I’ll make a few assumptions here, so bear with me:
  

1.  You are playing solo mode (not squads, 50v50, etc.)
2.  You are only playing to win (you are not trying to complete daily challenges)
3. Players in the game are of varying skill levels
* No one in the game is cheating (through hacks, teamplay in solo or otherwise)
* If you die you’ll immediately quit the game and start another
* You've got basic, rudimentary skills in the game (you can fire and hit a stationary target on a somewhat regular basis)
 
 
Assumption 5 is what I think is the cause of most people being too frivolous with their health. While fantastic for replayability, when you die you’ll most likely say “Dammit!” then go straight into another game. While this is fine for games like COD where you enter straight back into the same match with a chance to “come back”, in Fortnite you’ve now lost the entire match and don’t get another shot at it. Losing a life in Fortnite is therefore much greater impact, but because it’s so easy to start a new game it doesn’t feel like it. Just because you’re not actively punished for losing doesn’t mean that you’re not still losing. As such you need to be as careful at the start of a match as you are at the end. Health is just as important at the beginning as at the end because it's a limited resource (yes there are ways to replenish health, but they're not guaranteed). 
 
Now we’ve established that, let’s look at a game:
 
**COMBAT**
 
Straight off the bat, the odds are against you. If you’re an average level player you’re automatically playing against 49.5 people who are better than you at the game. Odds are that this is you. It’s certainly me.
 
Let’s say that you have a 25% chance of beating someone in the top 25th percentile, a 50% chance of beating any player in the 26-75th percentile and a 75% chance of beating someone in the 76-100th percentile in a one-on-one fight with no advantage (aside from skill) to either player.  Straight away this means that for every fight you engage in you’ll be losing health. It may not be much health, but it’s health nonetheless. There are a few ways to get this back (bandages, med-packs, shield potions, small shield potions, slurp juice, campfires and the chug jug), but even then the majority won’t bring you back up over 75 health and so you’re now going to lose even more fights against someone with even skill as you because you’re starting with 75 health and they’re starting with 100 (Yes they could lose health in previous fights and not be at 100, but its certainly not something you want to count on).
 
So how do you get the advantage? Simple. You fight like a coward. Or, more accurately, you don’t. The only fights you should be engaging in are fights you KNOW you can win without taking any damage. This gains you the most rewards (guns/ammo/building materials/health-packs) without losing your most valuable asset (health/shields). If you can’t win a fight without a 100% guaranteed win (without taking damage), don’t engage at all. When I say this I assume that engaging in combat is a choice you're making. If you follow further along with this you'll see how to choose when combat occurs. 
 
Keep in mind that when I mention winning a fight without taking damage, this means fighting, winning and after using any items the enemy drops you’re at the same or higher total health, ammo and resources than you were before the fight (Early fights won’t win you much of any of those, but later fights will – it’s way too much risk for little to no reward to engage early. You should only fight back, never start a fight). If a fight has cost you anything you’ve already taken a step backwards. If you start a fight with 100 shield, end the fight with 25 shield and the enemy dropped 3 small shield potions then you’ve lost some advantage in this fight (you can only go to max 50 shield now and in a fight against someone with 100 shield of equal skill you’ve now lost). Potential to be at a higher health while not actually being there is often useless unless you’re fantastic at fighting and multitasking in battle so you can build cover and chug potions at the same time.

There's normally only one way you'll get knocked out of the game and that's by engaging in combat and losing. The solution? Don't enter combat.
 
Your only goal at the start is to get to the top 10. First I’ll show you how to do that.
 
 
**LANDING**
 
I’ll get you to try a simple test: when the game starts, don’t jump off the bus. In fact, let the bus auto-kick you when it gets to the end of its run and *immediately* deploy your glider. Watch the kill feed and the player count. More often than not by the time you hit the ground the player count will be no higher than 60-65. You’ve now out-survived 35-40% of players without doing anything and the first circle will already be displayed and the countdown to the storm shrinking will be ticking down. The players who are all dead are the ones who decided to get straight into the action (after all, if they die they’ll load straight into another game, right?).  This is just an exercise though, don't do it in a game you're trying to win. This just lets you observe how quickly the player base can get whittled down.
 
As soon as players jump, they go for named areas populated with high rarity equipment – Tilted Towers, Loot Lake, Pleasant Park, etc.  (Yes, at the moment it's basically 50 people landing at Tilted Towers, but this just means that you've got lots of other places that should be void of other life where you can get geared up in peace. This won't last long though, in a few weeks people will go back to multiple main landing areas instead of one major one). For each chest in this area you’ll find a few people competing. As I’ve mentioned before, you should only be fighting when you’re guaranteed of not losing a fight. This initial burst of activity is where most deaths occur in the shortest period of time. You don’t want to be a part of that. If you're reading this guide you're not an uber killing machine, you're an average player who just wants an umbrella. You want to win, so you want to avoid all chances at dying. As such, spend a little time experimenting. [Here are the current chest spawns](https://i.redd.it/52vp3qe4chc01.jpg) Find unnamed areas away from the action which have a few chests or gun spawns and try landing there. You’ll quickly get an idea which areas are popular landing spots and which are ripe for the picking with little interference. I’ve got a few areas I know I’ll only ever encounter someone at maybe one in ten games, otherwise I’ll get maybe 4-5 chests to myself just by landing, searching and running to adjacent chest locations.  I’ve now got a decided advantage over most players who are fighting other people for the chance at 2-3 chests. Four chests to one person is a much better split than 3 chests to 5 people. Especially seeing as the ammo, shields and health in those 3 chests is already going to be spent defending from the other people who are also trying to get them.
 
 
**SURVIVING**
 
By now the game is on, you've gone to your new favourite spot, looted a bunch of stuff, the circle is about to shrink and you’ve got – at the very least – a few white weapons with ammo (If you haven’t keep exploring starting areas until you find one that allows you to at least start with this). What’s next? Going with the credo of “Stay out of trouble” you’re going to want to take note of where you are in relation to the circle.
 
Are you inside the circle? Find a bush (preferably one with a good view all around - do NOT use the bush consumable. It makes you too big of a target when you're trying to be stealthy walking around) and park your keister in it. Equip a weapon you’re comfortable with (preferably a shotgun or assault rifle – don’t sit there with a pickaxe or rocket launcher as they poke out of the bush and give you away). Keep on the lookout and keep rotating (being careful not to move too quickly, causing yourself to stand and give yourself away).  The only time you should do anything now is if you absolutely have to. See that guy running right next to your bush? Let him pass. Yes, it’s stressful but you’re staying away from anything that could cost you precious health. The only exception is if you know 100% that you can win the fight without taking damage (remember, every point of damage you take now is one you can’t take later when it’ll actually matter), plus you need weapons and you 100% know for sure that no one else is nearby who will hear your fight and come looking to kill the low-health winner. Stay this course until you either need to move or you’re in the top 10.
 
Are you outside the circle? Look at your map, the time left and the distance you’ve got to travel. It takes 45 seconds to cover the distance of one map grid square  along the lines or 65 seconds on the hypotenuse (over flat ground). The simple fact is that 99% of players avoid the storm like the plague. You’ll take advantage of this by riding it in each time. You *always* want to make sure that as few enemies as possible can surprise you. As such you should be sticking to coastlines (you’ve only got to worry about enemies coming from 180 degrees, tops, in this case). As the storm closes in, people will run towards the center of the circle. The further out you are, the greater chance that you’ll be the furthest person out. This means that while people are running from the storm they’re only facing one way – inwards. You’ll be able to see them, but they won’t be focused on you (This is the same reason most motorcyclists try to go a few km/hr faster than surrounding traffic). Use this information to guide where you go.  Combining this with a coastline can often mean you're only looking out for enemies in a 90 degree field of view. You’ll want to find a bush near the edge of the storm with a good vantage point, then lather, rinse and repeat. If you see someone, don’t engage unless you can 100% win the fight without taking damage and you know that there's no one behind you in the storm. DO NOT think ""meh, I'll just take one shot"" or ""I can *probably* get them from here"". Taking just one shot can alert enemies you haven't seen, causing them to engage you, resulting in you losing health and costing you the game. Only fight if you absolutely have to. Remember to give yourself enough time to get into the next circle just as the countdown for it ends and it finishes closing– the circle moves faster on one side than the other usually so account for that. You want to get to the top 10 in pristine condition.
 
If you have to, in an emergency, duck into the storm and use it as cover (especially earlier when it doesn’t do much damage). Most people have trouble seeing into the storm from outside it, so if taking 10 damage from being in the storm while you get better cover saved you from taking 20 damage from gunfire, that’s a fair trade to make. This is all about being pragmatic and getting to the top 10 with the highest health/shields/etc. possible.
 
 

**THE TOP 10**
 

Here’s where the gameplay changes significantly. At this stage people play MUCH more defensively. Heart rates go up, paranoia seeps in. Some people set up forts where they hope the circle will close around. Some people will set up sniper towers and try to pick others off. Some will get to the highest point and secure it. Cover becomes more scarce and bushes are harder to get to unnoticed. Your goal here is to stay out of other people’s way. Bushes, buildings, etc. are all great. Keep your eye on the player count. Let the other players wear themselves out. Pay close attention to where firefights are happening – you’ll know where there are big piles of loot plus where there are people still alive.
 
There are a few tricks you can use to your advantage here. If you’re feeling especially cheeky, find a player tower that’s got an edge near the storm and sneak up to the back of it – people often don’t look straight down at that area, they’re too busy looking for other high positioned snipers or into the map to clear a path to move inwards. If you’ve got a silenced gun, use it to cause fights among other players. Can you see two players? Fire near each of them to cause them to look and see the other player. They’ll fight, kill each other and now you’re one step closer to victory and the survivor has most likely taken damage giving you an advantage. If you don’t have a silenced weapon, listen to what the other players are using and try to switch to that weapon. Get players to think someone else took that lone shot at them and let them get “revenge”.
 
You want to try and keep out of the action until the top 2. Fight if you absolutely have to, but try your best to play people against each other. Once you're in the top three you want to let the other guys fight it out. If you can watch their fight all the better. You'll be in perfect health and the ""winner"" of that fight will most likely have some injuries you can take advantage of. You can even use the time they're fighting with each other to get yourself a good position to attack once their fight is over. People get tunnel vision when they're in a firefight and you can usually sneak into a prime position easily as long as you use some common sense. 
 
 
**THE TOP 2**
 

There are two ways to win from here on out. Skill and luck. I know that sounds stupid, but I’ve seen more than one match won because one player got lost in the storm, fell off a tall building/hill or accidentally blew themselves up. It happens more often than it should and I’m guessing it’s because at this stage your heart is pounding in your ears and it makes people do stupid stuff. If you know you're the worst fighter in the game you may want to try and force this. By following the steps above you'll get to this position enough that eventually someone WILL make a fatal mistake and you'll get that coveted umbrella. 
 
More than likely though, you’re going to have to fight a 1v1 against someone who knows what they're doing at least a little bit. The circle will be small enough now that you should be fairly well stocked with weapons as you’ve had to run through plenty of corpses who placed top 10 and collected all the good weapons for you into small, easily stolen piles. If you’ve followed this then you’re hopefully going into a battle against an enemy where you’ve got full health, full shields and all the weapons/ammo/resources you need. If the enemy has been engaging in fights they’ll probably be stuck in their tower or near cover with less than full health/shields giving you the advantage. The rest of this fight is up to you. If you've made it to the last three and watched the last 2 guys duke it out, swoop in before the winner of that fight gets a chance to heal (or better yet if you can, *while* they're healing). You want to make the most of every advantage you have. Don't just sit in a bush and wait for death though. You need to get in there and take victory.




**QUESTIONS I'M ANTICIPATING:**
 

*IF THIS IS SO EASY, WHY DOESN’T EVERYONE DO IT?*
 

Simply put? It’s not the most exciting way to play. Most people prefer to run and gun. Run and gun is faster, less boring for the most part and gives you a more immediate sense of accomplishment (“Yeah, I’ve got twelve kills this game!”). Also, if someone gets close to me I often think ""Bah, I'll just take a shot anyway. I can probably kill him now"". While it feels good in the short term, I often take damage and hurt my chances at actually winning. It also sucks hiding in a bush for 90% of the game and getting knocked out.

Streamers don't do it because it's not a playstyle that brings in viewers and therefore revenue. But if you're looking for tips on how to win your first umbrella, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're not streaming for your million subscribers.
 
While most people agree that small shield potions facilitate an offensive kind of play, when it comes to end game there’s normally very few (if any) regular shield potions making it almost impossible to get your shields over 50. If you've got 100 shield, you've normally got a huge advantage.
 
If I’m going for daily objectives for specific weapon kills, I drop straight into populated areas, grab the gun I need and get as many kills as I can before getting taken out. I’m not going into those matches with the intent to win, I’m going in there with the intent to kill. In those cases I’m one of the people you’ll see on the kill feed earlier on. It's fun and frantic and *that's* where I have fun with killing. If I want to win though, I use the above steps. 
 
It’s also *really hard* not to attack people as they run within a few feet of you in a bush. Trust me. The first few times you do it you'll feel your heart beating out your chest wondering if they'll spot you. But you need to harness that. Become one with the bush. Before you know it you'l be getting within the top ten at least 80% of the games you play. 



*YOU SUCK, THIS IS A CHEAP PLAYSTYLE, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED, WINNERS RUN AND GUN TO THE END! THE ONLY BUTTONS YOU SHOULD EVER PRESS ARE FORWARD, BUILD AND FIRE! WHY DO YOU SUCK SO MUCH u/Natural_Justice?*



Ok, that's not very nice. But you know what they call the guy who finishes bottom of his class in medical school? They call him ""Doctor"".

If you can run and gun to the end and win easily then this guide isn't for you.
If you think this is a cheap playstyle and you've got heaps of wins, then this isn't for you.
But if you're up to game number 486 and still can't get a single win, what have you got to lose? Stop putting artificial limits on yourself and give it a try. 

Bushes aren't the perfect size and shape to hide in by accident....",FortNiteBR

In the last 6 months, Battle Royale has had 17 updates. Save the World has had one. A single update. And the Valentine's day event has been delayed. Again. It doesn't even look like the ""great epic, an amazing business that pays attention to what players want!"" That I see being praised on this subreddit. If you guys take a look at the Fortnite subreddit (the one for stw, not this one), you'll see EVERYONE is upset with the lack of updates, and more than that, communication. A dude from epic just commented on a post something like ""yeah, the patch is not coming today, I'll say when smiley face"". It's frustrating.


We've paid for the game just to be kicked to the corner, it feels like. And it also feels like epic doesn't read what we write on r/FORTnITE. That's why I'm ""bitching"" about it here. I'm sorry if that doesn't matter tk you, though. I'm not jealous of BR, I play it too. I just want the long needed bug fixes and more content. While BR royale feels like a ""full"" game already, stw is missing so much stuff. Of course, BR games in general are ""simpler"".

I wasn't cheating OR doing anything stupid so I have a problem here. Before getting banned, I played a couple games and I kept getting kicked off of the games. I tried to fix it but it just kept popping up. I have no cheats, and I dont even own a VPN so I have literally no idea what caused this. I just want to start playing Fortnite as soon as possible. I don't have cheats or even own a VPN so there was obviously a mistake. Please help! It's not just happening to me either, there have been several people who have posted about this.

Either Increase the rarity of drops on the less popular towns of the map, or delete and make the map  smaller .

Right now slurp juice is considered 'epic' tier and shield potions are 'rare' even though both give an extra 50 at most with shield potions being more viable as you have to be at most 75 HP/Shields to get the full effect out of the slurp juice.

It is, of course, fair that they are not hitbox included; it would be an obvious disadvantage to purchase a skin just to become an easier target. But, at the same time, with it being so pronounced visually but not factoring in hits, I can't help but think that it does (contrary to the mantra) offer a combat advantage in distracting/misleading opponents.

However whenever I stumble across a post on Reddit complaining about the double pump, I always see people complaining about the damage of the pump shotgun in general. People say that a pump headshot should not be a 1 hit kill. This does not make sense. If a bolt action is a 1 hit headshot, so should the pump. At least when you are in a shotgun battle you know you are playing with fire and might get burnt. The sniper seems more unfair and unfun to get killed by. At least you have a fighting chance in a shotgun battle. Think of most shooters you have played. A sniper headshot and a shotgun headshot are both pretty much always 1 shots. Dogshit players on Reddit are getting worked by skilled players who know how to aim with shotguns. Is double pump broken and unfair? Absolutely. Is getting 1 hit by a pump headshot unfair? I don't think so. I really hope Epic does not continue to listen to unskilled Redditors who want a more campy and slow game. I also see people complain that ""It's stupid that I can die at any second to a pump player."" Really? How is that any different from getting sniped from across the map? ",FortNiteBR

I've considered two reasons why Epic hasn't fixed it yet. 1: Programming wise it's been too difficult to add a mechanic that makes it so you don't reset the pump animation when you swap weapons. 2: They want the double pump in the game. Number 2 is hard to believe. 

Why not just make it so you can't carry two pump actions, or for that matter, two of any of the same type of weapon? The only issue with this is if you want to grab a gun for a friend...but that's a minor sacrifice to get rid of this exploit.

**Trigger Deadzones**

Left Trigger: Unlocked 0-50 (I like the way ADS feels unlocked instead of locked, but switching the deadzone instead of 100 means I ADS twice as fast.)

Right Trigger: Locked 0-5 (This fires almost as soon as you touch the button, I like how this trigger feels locked.)

**Stick Sensitivity**

Left Stick: Short, concave, default (The default setting for this stick is perfect, just moves your character where you want it to go. I use the short stick because it doesn’t require the same precision as aiming.)

Right Stick: Tall, concave, smooth (I really enjoy this setting, turning slowly is more precise, and turning quickly is just as fast a default, and faster if you really need to turn)

**Button Mapping** (Combat Pro)

Top Left Paddle: Right Thumbstick (This moves the crouch button to a more convenient spot instead of clicking the thumbstick. Works better in the heat of battle. In other games I usually map this paddle to Y, but with the Combat Pro settings, the pickaxe is mapped to Y which is less useful for gunfights. Also helps to quickly reset buildings.)

Top Right Paddle: B (I map all my ABXY buttons to paddles usually so my thumb never has to leave the thumbstick. My brain remembers B being on the right so it just made sense to use this paddle.)

Bottom Left Paddle: X (Same explanation as B)

Bottom Right Paddle: A (The two paddles I use the most are on the right side and that’s just easier to remember. I think the default settings for the paddles map all the ABXY buttons but they are in different paddles.)

Right Thumbstick: Y (At first, this is just something I had to do to compensate for not mapping my Y button to the top left paddle, but I’ve actually found it extremely convenient. My thumb still doesn’t have to leave the stick and it’s a quick and easy press to get out my pickaxe, which is still something you do very often in this game.)

The rest of the buttons are their default configurations. (Sidenote: I’d love the option to fully map our buttons to particular functions, so maybe I can map my ABXY buttons to actual functions, because they are just useless currently.) 

How do you guys configure your controller?

what it is, is a way to revive a dead teammate and it would not be in solos, it would take up an item slot like med kit(can't be stacked). It has to be used on a flat plane like a campfire. 

once used some satanic looking circle would appear in front of your character and your character would sit down in front of it for 20 seconds (can be canceled). once the ritual is done, a random dead teammate would spawn.

the specifics of it would be that the teammate would have a zombie model, like the ones in single player, spawn with 100 hp and no items. the zombie can't heal hp but can use shields, once their hp hits 0 they won't go down they die instead.

my reasoning for the item is that, squads is fun but its really not fun when 1 person dies and has to wait for their team to finish/die, so this gives a chance for them to play again. But they would be much weaker this time and their teammates would have to give them some weapons/materials to get them back into the game.

 - Raptor uses his shovel as a Pickaxe

 - Cuddle Team Leader uses the black Ribbon on the back as Glider

 - Love Ranger uses the Wings as glider

 - Crackshot uses his Hat as a Glider (thx to willswanson_)

 - Red Knight uses the shield on the back as a Glider

- Cuddle Team Leader Ribbon -&gt; Glider Item

- Love Ranger Wings -&gt; Glider Item

- Crackshot Hat -&gt; Glider Item

- Red Knight -&gt; Glider Item

You can use this Items only with the connected skin, and the special  will be active or you can use another Glider/Pickaxe for the skins and it will behave like it is now.

The pistols would be more inaccurate and could be controlled similarly to in Call of Duty. 

This way, pistols would be quicker and more powerful against shotguns and shotguns wouldn’t be as powerful relative to other short-range weapons. ",FortNiteBR

Effort to prioritize these issues? (wood fences, building under terrain, building/editing/rotating bugs, F**K DECIDUOUS TREES!)","The most unique (and fun imo) feature of this game is the building mechanic, but it has been so frustratingly unpolished for the longest time. 

- small wood fences block buildings

- almost all trees (and large objects like cars) absurdly block any buildings not even in contact with them. Often off grid so very clunky to build around certain objects.

- after map update, so many places seems to not allow ""floating"" buildings and force you to build underneath the ground first. Not sure if it's an issue with the map or the building system.

- Bugs: 1. cant build, 2. cant edit, 3. random rotations of ramps

- **FUCK TREES**. This game makes me hate mother nature, Epic!

- Feature to add counter-clockwise rotation i.e. q for CCW, e for CW while blueprint equipped.

It's a dream that we could see a polished clean arena where experienced players can just go nuts and not worry about all the issues.

I have so many trust issues with building in this game and it feels horrible to get screwed not because of skill (or even bad luck) but because of the building mechanic.",FortNiteBR

It requires a lot more skill to line up a shot and risk a slow reload in combat than just spamming the tactical shotgun. I’m willing to have my mind changed on this topic, but there’s a trade off with each weapon and I feel people are only complaining about the Pump being overpowered because they’re salty they get killed or can’t use it.

EDIT 1: This isn’t meant to create controversy or insult anyone. I’m just genuinely curious on why you think so.

Even though the gun itself is rare, at end game typically someone has it through killing someone with it. Rocket ammo is considered rare, although a skilled/smart player can easily obtain it through ammo boxes, which it constantly drops out of. When people jump and shoot straight down at you with near no accuracy, there is a great chance you will get one shotted, or your shield and health will be erased.

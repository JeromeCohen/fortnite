They have no sense of a direction they want to take Fortnite in and every update is 1 step forward, 2 steps back. The community and bigger names are finally starting to criticize the game and now Epic finally has to do something. Imo the days of trying to balance the comp scene with over the top rng casual additions are dwindling down as now the game is starting to rely on these additions. Yes I’m talking about Planes. I don’t think Fortnite can healthily exist as an eSport while catering towards the casuals first. Something needs to change because in many respects it’s 2 groups playing an entirely different game. The comp scene focuses on improvement, mechanics, and balance that seem even over the developers heads let alone the 50 players per lobby who haven’t built unless it was an accident. Although Fortnite is still relatively healthy as far as playerbase an interest I think that toxicity will eventually take over if Epic continues to pump energy into driving this game in the wrong direction.

I used to play a LOT of WoW, and it was extremely helpful for all the keybinds in the game. I've spent a good bit of time in FN with the Razer and have made a lot of use out of all the side buttons. Mostly weapon swaps. FN was the first shooter on PC I've played. I wanted to explore different mice, but obviously most mice only have the standard 2 side buttons. I got a new mouse and tried to adapt. I had two building binds on my mouse, which I kept, and have been trying to swap weapons with the number keys. I find myself fumbling sometimes and missing swaps and it's costing me, obviously. And I feel like if I'm trying to shotgun swap after an edit, I'm very sluggish. At the end of the day, I know it's mostly irrelevant because I'm not an insane player, and the only reason using a standard mouse would be beneficial would be if there was any chance at playing at an event, considering you're not always entitled to your own devices. But I like the idea of having options when it comes to mice. And I'm always looking to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I overthinking it, and I just need to adapt to a mouse with 2 side buttons? Or should I stick to what I've been comfortable with thus far? Was I hindering myself relying on so many side buttons?

&amp;#x200B;

I got the new mouse Wednesday, but I swapped the side panel on my Naga a few days beforehand trying to practice ahead of time. I'd say I've spent an average of 2-3 hours at most a day the past week trying things basically an entirely new way for me. Is this a bad idea? I can feel slight improvement, but I just feel slower and less reactive. I find myself thinking a lot about where my fingers are and where they're going.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking to hear opinions other than my own. I know almost everyone uses a standard mouse and played other BRs and these things are natural, but I started out playing completely different and I'm curious if I did more harm than good.",FortniteCompetitive

Then he told me that he has a 6.5% in solos and a overall of 9% out of 1444 games he’s played so far. My first thought was well that must be because he doesn’t care about pubs or whatever. But then I started to think that maybe my expectations that a great player such as nick would win 15 to 20% of his games in pubs are too unrealistic.

There have been a lot of complaints about it in general and about vertical audio in particular. However, judging by how well some pros seem to locate the enemies (almost exact direction, distance and height) it doesn't seem to be that much of a problem to everyone (anymore).

I've had the HyperX Clould 2 for about 6 months now and felt some improvement when I got it. I haven't seen any more improvement lately, though, and I'm very far from perfect. I often lose track of the enemy even in simple situations (same level, distance known, just have to get the horizontal direction precisely). My motherboard is around 10 years old since I simply replaced a lot of parts instead of buying a new PC and never had to replace the motherboard, so maybe it's the onboard soundcard that's just bad.

Do you think you need specific settings or hardware for sound to be at a level that really allows for consistent tracking? I noticed a lot of streamers have external audio cards and mix tables. ",FortniteCompetitive

I've also wondered how is it that the game hasn't implemented some type of warning when running out of Materials. Both issues are crucial in build fights and need to be worked on to improve the game experience. Off the top of my head here are some easy solution to these problems ; there should be a bold indicator on the weapon active when in both build mode and pickaxe mode and when running out of matts there should be red warning glow on the matts counter and this can be active when your matts should fall below 100 .                                                                                 ,FortniteCompetitive

https://twitter.com/Convertibles/status/1083317232099254272

Hello everyone, my goal with this project is to a detailed review about every pro player. Based on a VOD that I find of them or one that they submit to me. I plan on doing these VERY regularly. I am sorry if this is clutter, however if I can help one person then it's worth it in my opinion.

VOD: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/360332069?t=01h56s

**1:00:57** Video starts off with Osmo scouting and talking about how they should be alone. Good scouting skills right off the bat. 

**1:01:09** Glances at the closest POI to them, the reason he does this is that in a point based system, if they had to take an early fight, they'd know that there will be people there. Osmo looks over there also to ensure that if there are people, the advantage that that the enemy will have is the huge mountain that overlooks all of where they are landing. Impressive scouting skills right off of the bat.

*Immediately starts farming phase.*

**1:03:45** If you look at all of the calls that Osmo has made, he is actually really good at calling economy. Mongraal hasn't made many economic calls, yet Osmo keeps it up. (This is exceptionally good as it can relate to a lot of the ""normie"" people on this subreddit. It shows how you should talk, even if your teammate doesn't do the same favours.)

**1:05:00** Mongraal asks for a scouting call, identifies if anyone is on the chair area. 

They begin their rotation after Osmo acknowledges and calls that there was no one there. 

**1:06:20** Osmo calls out that the guy took 50 points of damage. - Good damage call by him. Identifies that the guy is alone and under the zipline. He however, did not call to Mongraal to shoot the plane; no micro call was made. 

**1:07:04** Osmo identifies that the target is shooting, then calls out where the target is from. Even though they are not able to currently capitalize on this without a snipe play, the information call is good.

**1:07:40** Osmo is taking a pre-fire of a potential repeek. Let's talk about this for a second. 

# Prefire
Prefire is shooting where you think an enemy will expose himself from. If you prefire, it means that your shot will be there, the instant that the person shows himself. In hitscan, it means that you're playing with his reaction speed. If you pre-fire and he peeks, he has the interval of the bullet travel time to correct his movement to not get shoot (assuming that the shot connects) with projectile, such as the heavy sniper, it is a bit more complex, Osmo picks a likely peek (due to his understanding of player behaviour **Which is ESSENTIAL in pro play**) and fires there, taking into account the bullet travel speed.

**1:08:00** This is probably one of the best calls I've ever heard Mongraal call. ""Pretend that we don't see him, he thinks that we don't"" It may seem like a basic call. However, due to understanding of player behaviour, Mongraal is able to analyze the following

- There is a enemy present.
- There is a enemy present who has acknowledged the positions of Osmo and Mongraal
- The enemy has displayed patterns similar to ""acknowledging that osmo and Mongraal have not spotted said enemy""
- Mongraal calls to play the bait and fill the enemies false prophecy. 
- All of this is done in a split second. (This is one of the more basic bait tactics that gets used in pro level play and often turns into a siege play, or a pinch play.)

Good stuff Mongraal!

**1:08:14** Osmo is going along with the plan, and doesn't look at the target that Mongraal is calling. Osmo's vision is excessively limited at the moment. Osmo acknowledges this and lets Mongraal know that he does not know where the target is. Mongraal then paints a detailed picture of where the target is so that both of them are on the same page again. This is key. **DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS TO YOUR DUO**.

**1:08:20** Osmo goes for a shot without saying anything at all.
They had at least 1 second or even 3-4 if the people were going to continue north. Big misplay to not say anything. Could have abused FSA there. I can't tell with my internet if Mongraal got shots off or not, but I didn't see any. 

**1:08:50** Mongraal acknowledges that they're being chased. Osmo goes for another shot. Osmo calls his dink, does not call his damage value - not a good habit. ""HIT 64 BLUE"" is better than ""DINKED"".

**1:11:27** Osmo calls enemy, does not call that he's shooting. Also does not call how much he hit for, but he does say the guy is no shields.
He then calls status. ""Guy is using dynamite"" ""Guy on me""
*He doesn't really call macro or micro. Just status.*

**1:12:39** Looks for a drop play on the guy who has taken height off of him. Mongraal confirms that a drop play is possible. They execute drop play, and then Osmo goes into a cone so that the player doesn't get a lucky shot as he drops. 

**1:12:59** Osmo is in cone, looks over and gathers his bearing sees other people off to the side. He also asked Mongraal if he had a quad launcher shot, with this he could've phased through and had the W key advantage on the unsuspecting enemy. Relays that info to Mongraal. He then sees Mongraal is in need of help. Instantly sacrifices his own positioning to help his teammate. 

**1:13:12** Mongraal calls for help. Good call from Mongraal. Asking for help is perfectly fine from your duo. Osmo rushes over to Mongraal.  

**1:13:19** Osmo gets a shot off on the guy below. Mongraal affirms that he's gathered his bearings. Osmo then assures that he is okay. Mongraal asks osmo to get over to him. Mongraal asks him to come down. Which is a good call, as it tells Osmo which way to go, when he has 0 information. 

**1:13:55** Osmo then takes a shield and calls for Mongraal to be the scouting player. 

Status calls keep getting made.

**1:14:20** Osmo confirms 1.

*Status calls continue.*

*They get rushed by 1 guy. Osmo gets knocked. They look for heals to recover.*

**1:16:23** Osmo calls that there is 1 person, behind them and that they're close. Mongraal instantly goes for the lowground flank. Osmo goes for the height angle. With dual angle they're both able to successfully aquire good LOS. 

**1:16:58** During this fight, Osmo calls that he's hit one and also calls that he's taking an edit.


**1:17:28** Osmo lines up a heavy shot. Doesn't call he sees or is going for the shot. Mongraal does the lowground rush. Osmo does the height rush. It seems they're super successful at this. 

**1:18:28** Osmo identifies that there are two people that will be rushing his teammate. He calls this out and then goes for the shot. He already made sure that he was protected, so he's holding a good angle at the moment to help his teammate who is currently on lowground. Mongraal helped Osmo by scouting for him, letting him know that there are people currently above him. 

**1:18:33** Osmo calls that he will use his GL if people get closer. 

**1:18:54** Mongraal calls that quadding them down is a good idea, and begins to do so.

**1:19:00** Osmo covers the angle.

**1:19:07** They get stinked and have to rotate. Great stinks by the enemy. Mongraal calls that they have a campfire and that they can use this to regain the HP that they've lost. 

**1:19:50** Osmo identifies that there is one. Osmo then identifies that that he is in storm and starts to shoot him. However, these are just status calls. The target call here becomes ""NO SKIN IN STORM"". Which is implicit, not explicit. 

**1:19:55** Osmo begins to GL, does not call that he is GL'ing or asks for Mongraal to spam for his GLs. - Wasted value of a teammate here in my personal opinion. Could've worked a bit stronger. 

**1:20:15** Osmo calls for ""I think we can..."" 
I used to have this problem in Overwatch when IGL'ing. Calls such as ""I think, or What if.."" Don't make those calls. Make the actual call. So many more benefits in doing that.

**1:20:20** Mongraal calls to go lowground. This is the first NON Status call I've heard this VOD. This is good. If they started to focus more on Micro/Macro calling, and worked a bit on their colour scaling, Osmo and Mongraal would see huge improvement results immediately.

**1:20:40** Funny moment - Mongraal calls ""He's white, that guy is white"" LOL when there's two of them gliding. No harm in doing this, just thought it was funny.

**1:20:45** Osmo calls a threat, assesses it, then concludes ""Close the edit"". Good Micro call here.

**1:20:58** Osmo calls that taking height is a possiblity, then they both do it. Again another status call. 

**1:20:03** Osmo shoots at two people completely out in the open, but doesn't call this to Mongraal at all? Absolutely could've done much more damage as a team here. 

**1:22:20** Mongraal asks for economy. Osmo agrees with his plan to rift. Osmo takes storm damage. Osmo then takes even more damage when in glider mode.  Mongraal uses this time to plan. Good stuff. Really good use of time here by him.

**1:22:13** Osmo starts to shoot at a guy, but doesn't call damage values. Grenade launchers another, doesn't call GL.

# Key Points:

I'm going to go ahead and dub both Mongraal and Osmo as the **KINGS of Status calling** I think a good 99% of their calls were simply facts. They're going to be an absolutely nasty combo if they work on their confidence and their actually leadership abilities. I think a Co-Caller environment would suit them with a double aggro playstyle. I don't think I've heard this many status calls since I was reviewing squad scrims months ago. Absolutely stunning use of them. Micro and Macro calls can be seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9wty3y/how_to_be_the_ultimate_igl_part_1/

A solo micro-macro setup, such as what Cloak does, COULD potentially work for a player such as Osmo, but would definately put a burden on him. Am curious to see if such a style would work on this duo. 


# What can we learn from Osmo and Mongraal?

We are able to see the importance and how far just calling ""status"" can take you. Status calls are commonly referred to as YELLOW calls. Colour scale can be seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aa6wke/how_to_be_the_ultimate_igl_part_2_colouring/

This shows you how far yellow calls can take you alone. These are very simple calls. We're able to see countless examples of them throughout the play from Osmo and Mongraal both.

Around beginning of S6, I switched to 1156x1080 (the lowest my monitor can go keeping it at 1080), and got even more FPS. Became a much better player and was very pleased with the gameplay as well.

I ""quit"" right after the monsters got implemented and have just been recently getting back into the game.

I launch in my stretched res, and instantly notice i'm getting around 40-50 FPS dropping tilted when I used to get 150+.

I went back to native the other day to test it out, dropped tilted, and had 180+ FPS. 

I am so confused, I use Fullscreen mode and all my settings are on low or off besides Epic view distance.

Any solutions or is it just me?",FortniteCompetitive

Traps themselves are a viable item to carry in your inventory and could also be an inventory slot item - just make them spawn in stacks of 3 so it is a bit more worth carrying. The turret is also a mini gun that doesn't use an inventory slot, rendering the mini gun not worth carrying.

A little disclaimer: I'm not a great player.  I would consider myself an above-average casual.  I've been lurking on this sub, picking up tips and tricks for a while now and largely thanks to you guys, I'll drop a couple double-digit wins a week and feel pretty damn good about it.  However, I, like most others will occasionally perform well above my normal abilities and make it seem effortless.  Just today, I single-handedly wiped 2 squads to secure a manic 12 kill win.  The next game, I choked to a 5-year-old on mommy's iPhone.  Basically, I have no credibility but I still think this can help all of us.

TLDR on the article: The most elite athletes in the world consistently exhibit a trait called the ""quiet eye."" It is characterized by much slower, more deliberate eye movement.  It is accompanied by a slower heart-rate and rate of thought process as well as vastly increased precision and consistency.  This is a mostly unconscious phenomenon but research appears to indicate that practicing slower, less erratic eye movement can help facilitate this state of mind.  Most of you at the top(ish) of the game are mechanically brilliant but I've seen several posts about training game sense or composure under pressure.  Quiet eye training might help you with that.  If you are able to consciously trigger a calm and deliberate state of mind, the little things will take care of themselves - your instincts are good enough - and in time, it could help you elevate your game to that next level.",FortniteCompetitive

# Points System (SOLOS)

***Please give suggestions on points as many people seem to disagree on this***

* **Placements:** \&gt; Top 25  

   * 25*th - 21st:* 1 point
   * 20*th - 16th:* 2 points
   * *15th - 11th:* 3 points
   * *10th - 6th:* 4 points
   * *5th - 4th:* 5 points
   * *3rd - 2nd:* 6 points
   * *1st:* 8 points
* **Kills:** 2 Points per kill
* **Assists:** 75+ dmg to a player counts as an assists if he dies in the next minute: 1 Point per assist
* **Getting Killed**   

   * 100th-76th: -6 points
   * 75th-41st: -4 points
   * 40th-16th: -2 points

Losing points would actually make the system viable. Otherwise it's impossible to categorise and divide players by elo as your elo would be forever growing.

Duos and Squads would be something similar but with different points given.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# A BALANCED SYSTEM THAT REWARDS AGGRESSION BUT ALSO ALLOWS PLAYING SAFE

This system allows for different strategies instead of the good old farming/camping until the final circles. The game flow would change as getting kills is as important as placements.

Also, since you loose 6 points if you die on the first 25 placements, hot dropping won't be effective.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# ITEMS/GAMEPLAY CHANGES FOR COMPETITIVE ONLY

* Explosive items are limited to RPG &amp; grenade launcher.
* Mobility needs to be reviewed but I honestly think it's fine as it is in normal. Only planes need to be nerfed.
* Maybe Grappler needs some tweeks.
* Bounce pad and impulse are back.
* No turrets
* \+50 HP/Shield on kill
* \+100/50/50 wood/brick/metal on kill

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# RANKS

**You get demoted to a lower league when you get to 0 points. You get promoted to a new league when getting to 100(or more?) points.**

* Wood  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Brick  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Metal   

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Silver  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Gold  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Epic  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Legendary  

   * I, II, III
* Mythic League  

   * Points systems: starts at 50 points. Demotion when getting to 0.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# REWARDS

At the end of each season each player gets a unique reward (skins/emotes/etc.) for their rank. All items are special and only available at the end of each season. Never to be available on the shop.

Yesterday I was banned in the Tfault discord by a senior moderator. I did not que into a game. (when I do, I use streamer mode because I have TV in my gamertag. I have never killed Tfue or his teammates (or stream sniped in general because I stream as well.) 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I got banned was because I had typed ""Chillllll"" in east-codes (which I thought was east-scrim-chat, but I was glancing at my laptop and typed) after I had seen someone say ""Let's start warning people who talk in this chat"". 

Soon after I was no longer in the discord server.

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly play scrims with my team and sub to Tfue and Cloak to support them.. I was looking forward to playing tonight but couldn't. I have always followed the rules and focused on end game as well. Super disappointing I got banned over this when it should've been a warning. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then talked to a mod in Cloak's discord, Ant, and he ""submitted a request"". I just think I was unfairly banned by a mistake of typing in the wrong chat, which I thought was east-scrim-chatter and not east-codes.

I do enjoy the mechanic of the deagle, and often find myself using it. However, I do believe that it is a bit on the strong side. My fix would be to make it so that it cannot instantly destroy fresh builds that are made out of brick or metal. This would be a considerable counter to the OPness of instant building destruction.

A few weeks ago, I made a post asking for help dropping markers to collect some data in order to generate heat maps of player landings, and thanks to the help from you guys, the heat maps are now ready to view! 

Here’s a preview of what a heat map looks like: [Heat Map Preview](https://imgur.com/a/SpKIjw0)



## How to View the Heat Maps

Move the slider at the bottom of the screen to change the angle of the bus. The corresponding heat map will appear once you release the slider.

**Check out the maps here: [fortnitedrops.us/heatmap](https://fortnitedrops.us/heatmap)**



------

#### Some things to note

- All the paths will go through the center of the map at 18 different angles.
  - The initial release was limited to 18 paths because I had no idea how many entries this would get and I wanted to make sure there was enough data per path. 
- At the time of writing this post, there are **around 700 markers per path**, which is a decent starting sample. As a result, **36 new off-centered paths have been added**, so keep on dropping! 
- The new paths will be added to the heat map viewing page in a later update. (Need to change the UI and stuff for the new paths)



------

## Customization Features

*Customize the heat map's appearance by clicking the gear in the top-left corner.* 



### Custom Colors

If you’re having a hard time seeing the default colors or just think they’re ugly, you can set your own colors for ""cold"" and ""hot"" areas on the map. Valid color formats include:

- `#ffffff, rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), hsla()`
- [Predefined CSS color names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) (e.g. `red` or `pink`)



### Individual Player View

Enable a view that shows the exact position of each individual player on the map. If you start experiencing degraded performance, try turning this feature off.





------

### Future work

- draw path and search for closest match
- group adjacent bins to get subtotals
- subtotals for named/popular locations
- bin size customization
- responsive bin sizes for mobile/smaller screens
- general heat map visual improvements



------

### TLDR;

- Heat maps found here: [fortnitedrops.us/heatmap](https://fortnitedrops.us/heatmap)
- Slide to change bus angle
- 18 different maps, around 700 markers per map
- 36 new off-centered bus paths added
- Custom colors and views can be found in top left corner
- Dogs are the best

So I've been having this issue for a while and its really odd since I haven't heard about it anywhere else.

Here's a video of the bug happening 4 times in a row: https://youtu.be/GzqHnq7KQVM

In these cases I am building and letting go of R2 all together but my gun still auto shoots. It's not a ghost shot either since it uses ammo and my teammates can usually hear the shot.

It's worth noting that I did switch my floor and roof piece, so L1 places a floor and R1 places a roof.

Does anyone else have this issue?",FortniteCompetitive

Since Summer Skirmish was announced and began, we, the viewers have been able to enjoy watching official competitive play quite often, the longest previous break being between the Fall Skirmish Finals and the Winter Royale First Playable Session (27), which mind you was not an event streamed by Epic, but by streamers themselves (I'm sure many people played in the qualifiers so not many would have watched anyway). I hope this big break is to finalize everything for the Fortnite World cup. Would be nice to see which new players we get who weren't eligible to play in Winter Royale (Such as TSM\_Clouds) as well as which people practised making sure they would make it this time.

Drops to 80 happen as well in late game scrims with 20 people alive.

Now would upgrading to an 9700k help? Doing some quick research the single core speed difference is about 30% so do you think this will help me keep 144 fps or close to it?

Regular areas are up to 250-280 fps.

Currently the pumps hit for 95/100/105/110 with a 2.0X headshot multiplier this is way too strong to the body and does not reward headshots as much as it should. 

This also makes the green pump useless. There is not another gun that one tier of it has a huge fundamental difference between the other tiers (not being able to one pump to the head) 

I think the perfect solution to both of these problem would be to change the base damage to 80/85/90/95 with a 2.5 multiplier to the head. 

With this change the pumps would still be strong but actually reward headshots and aim. 

This would also make the green pump hit for an even 200 to the head making it just as viable as the other pumps.

I think overall they are very useful, but it would be nice to get a slight bloom reduction at some point, even at the cost of some damage, for consistency's sake. 

As for the drop rate reduction for dynamite &amp; boomboxes, I am actually pretty hyped. I actually had a full 10 stack of minis today while still at 0 kills. I can't remember the last time that happened before this patch. 

The vaulting of the six shooter &amp; regular bursts has also been very nice. Opening chest early game &amp; *not* getting white bursts has been great. I don't have much else to say about this one. It was about time. 

I haven't gotten to use the new suppressed sniper myself too much yet, but I will say that it is a slightly annoying addition. There were a few games I played last night where I was having trouble figuring out where the shots were coming from. It's not a game breaking issue by any means, though, so it's whatever imo. 

Those were pretty much all the changes that I think I've *noticed* in game. I know the planes &amp; boomboxes were ""nerfed,"" but I can't say I felt any difference with them. Overall, though, I'm happy with this update. There are obviously plenty of other changes/fixes for epic to implement, but I'll take what I can get. 

What are your guys' thoughts on everything?

I really really think you can be a top tier player with a controller and some players showed us that (Issa, Kamo, Aydan and some more).

But really, you just stick with 60 fps (and I'm being nice when I say 60 because it never really feels like 60 especially when a lot is going on in game). You just play with shadows, motion blur, epic settings...

How are you even supposed to play against someone with a far more clear and smoother game ? We're talking about competitive and any e-sport lover will tell you this is more than a huge advantage.
I get that if you want to be a top tier player you gotta buy a pc but we, console players, are currently put in a frustrating and akward position where we can't do shit at some point.

Some console players would definitely buy a pc if they knew they were part of the top tier console player but at the moment there is no way to know so it's just a stupid risk to buy a pc just to play competitivly fortnite.

I really believe there should be some way to play only between console players in ranked /pop up cup playlist. It's truly not logical to play the whole year against players on the same plarform if epic decide to run cross platforms for competitive playlists.

Currently the pumps hit for 95/100/105/110 with a 2.0X headshot multiplier this is way too strong to the body and does not reward headshots as much as it should. 

This also makes the green pump useless. There is not another gun that one tier of it has a huge fundamental difference between the other tiers (not being able to one pump to the head) 

I think the perfect solution to both of these problem would be to change the base damage to 80/85/90/95 with a 2.5 multiplier to the head. 

With this change the pumps would still be strong but actually reward headshots and aim. 

This would also make the green pump hit for an even 200 to the head making it just as viable as the other pumps.

Obviously you can’t directly compare gamesense and mechanics between games, CSGO is taken much more seriously, and mean rank != average etc, but a 1kd player in fortnite is simply so bad at every facet of the game, and there are millions of those players. 

Even me, a player who started end of s2 but only really started playing frequently in s3 and had basically 0 prior shooter experience, and who only had ramp bound (no other build binds bound, I hit ramp and scrolled if I needed a floor or ramp), on a broken monitor, still had a kd of like 1.5 after a couple weeks (maybe 10-20 hours) of playing. 

Is it because they’re kids? The average age is lower than CS? Is it because for a lot of people fortnite is their first/one of their first shooter games vs something like CS where it’s not exactly a beginners game? Or is it because people struggle to understand the new mechanic of building?

First of all, if you have your build menu open, the range at which you can edit is increased. This is true for both PC and controller. So if you are trying to do a floor&amp;pyramid edit, you want your build menu open so you can start editing the floor from further down.

The problem that I find when using my controller, is that if I have my build menu open, it will prioritise editing the piece which I have selected. So if I have the floor pre-selected, it will edit the floor just fine, but struggle to edit the pyramid, and instead try to pre-edit the floor that I have selected. The same applied in lots of situations - the game will try to pre-edit when I'm trying to edit an already placed piece.

Is there any option to disable this? I never want to pre-edit my pieces, and would prefer to always edit the piece I am looking at. And I also want the advantage of an increased edit range by having my map out.",FortniteCompetitive

I got to a point where I felt pretty comfortable using the bolt. I was happy, and was hitting some decent shots and flicks.

Now, the heavy sniper comes into play. It's almost like I have no idea how to use the bolt anymore. I have come to realize how stupidly easy the heavy is to use. It's so easy to use, I don't know if I like it in the game. That thing hits with little to no compensation, where as the bolt you would actually have to make an adjustment. 

Maybe it's just me, but the heavy is really annoying to get killed by now knowing how little the bullets drop. This isn't even a thread about me getting killed by it. I have been finding way more heavies recently and just picked up a bolt for the first time in what feels like forever. First thing I thought of after getting a body shot with the bolt at like 60m, ""man that heavy sucks, it ruined my aim with this thing"".

I just think it's way too easy to use, given the semi-difficult nature of the bolt. The difference between the two in bullet drop is MASSIVE.

Now I'm not saying that console players are better, in fact PC players slap console players, a mouse will always beat a stick, binds will always beat basic button layouts, editing and building on a PC will always be superior, but what I'm saying is, the average console player is superior to the PC ""double"", and I put this down to age, there's a lot of young players on console, and reality is they have a lot of spare time, I barely see consistent build battles throughout PC streams, but come to console and there isn't a fight without building unless it's a rare bot or someone without mats. 

When I see Streamers complain about tryhards, that's our lobbies every single day, every hour.

If the average PC player is a 3, I can quite easily say the average console player is a 5, and where the best console player in the World is an 8, the best PC player would be a 10.

Tfue and Ninja's latest high kill gameplay, in Season 7, is the perfect example, I've played a few games tonight and 80% of the players I approached built impressively, on PC it's not a common occurrence unless these guys get custom matchmaking.

Recommending this concept is nothing new. 

***However,*** I haven't seen any fleshed-out and comprehensive concepts on what a competitive mode would not only look like in text form, but what it would look like in game as well.

Also bear in mind I am definitely NOT a Photoshop expert by any means, so bear with me if my concepts look a bit sloppy.

Sit down and grab some popcorn and a chug jug, this is gonna be a lengthy read. Don't worry, there will be images linked here in this post that condenses the entire concept into something a bit easier to visualize.

**- First: Reasoning. Why should we have a competitive mode in this game?**

* There's a lot of reasons why players have been requesting for a comprehensive ranked mode for a while. First, the lovingly-named ""Sweaty"" players would most likely flock to the new mode, eager to prove their skills and get matched with others who are similarly-skilled. Casual players will then most likely be the majority of the player population in the normal modes (Solo, Squad, etc), and LTMs would probably continue to have a mix of both.

* While the Pop-Up Cups were a good start, they weren't what the competitive playerbase was looking for and the matter of the Cups only being available on specific days and times is frustrating. There have also been instances of players not being matched against those who have a similar amount of points, which can be frustrating for both casual and competitive players.

* There are quite a few more reasons that players have been wanting a Ranked mode, but these are the two that I've most commonly seen and I'm sure others in the comments will share their reasons as well. Try to get as many points of view as possible!

**- Secondly: How would we get into the competitive mode?**

* My concept of this is pretty simple. It would look like it normally does when you choose a solo game, just like [this image here!](https://imgur.com/a/AMOuctJ)

* Now, when you're selecting what mode you want to play, the option to disable/enable competitive matchmaking would look [something like this.](https://imgur.com/a/ZTpgIse)

**- Thirdly: How do we get placed into our rank? What would the requirements be for this level?**

*Another disclaimer:* How placements would work in this game, or if there would even be placement matches is entirely up to Epic. For the sake of familiarity, these placement concepts will look very similar to Blizzard's FPS, Overwatch.

Also, just to be clear, the ranks I'm thinking of are the same as Overwatch's. From worst to best, this is:

1. **1-1499 FNR (Fortnite Ranking): Bronze**
1. **1500-1999 FNR: Silver**
1. **2000-2499 FNR: Gold**
1. **2500-2999 FNR: Platinum**
1. **3000-3499 FNR: Diamond**
1. **3500-3999 FNR: Master**
1. **4000+ FNR: Grandmaster**

* The concept itself to place yourself in a rank is actually pretty simple: You would hypothetically play 10 or so placement matches. During these placements, you would gain some FNR (Fortnite Ranking), the same thing as SR for my fellow Overwatch players, for every win and/or every kill.

* After those placements, you get placed into what tier you've earned through your FNR. 

* Ideally, it would would work something like this: So *hypothetically*, let's say a win is **300 FNR** in placements and a kill is worth **30 FNR**. 

* Placing in the top 15 would earn you about **5 FNR**. 

* If I won *8* games out of 10, placed top 15 *6* times, and got *39* kills in those 10 games, I'd earn approximately **3600 FNR** which would, again hypothetically, place me in about Diamond, which seems reasonable. [This would look something like this after your 10 placement matches.](https://imgur.com/a/uVL3FOa)
* 
After the placements, every win could be about **25-50** FNR and every kill could be **3-5** FNR, to prevent climbing the ranks too easily.

**- Fourth: Okay, sounds good, but what if we don't win or don't get any/a lot of kills?**

* In a battle royale, it's tough to gauge how much MMR/FNR you should lose (if any at all) if you lose a game even though that's how other games adjust MMR. 

* I think if you place below the top 15, maybe 20, you could lose 5 or so FNR. 

* If you finish a game with zero kills, you could lose 10 FNR. Remember, even one kill would gain you 3-5 FNR, depending on what seems reasonable from Epic.

**- Fifth: Overwatch and other games with ranked modes have rotating periods of play, usually named seasons. How would this work in Fortnite?**

* Seasons. Every game with an established competitive mode has seasons that finish and rotate every 3-4 weeks or so.

* Because Fortnite already has ""seasons"" referring to the Battle Pass, you could begin a new competitive season when the new BP season starts. However, these last a couple months. This could cause frustration, or even burnout on playing one ranked season for a couple months.

* The best solution to this in my opinion, is to rotate seasons about every month and a half, or approximately 6 weeks. This is a short enough time to keep players engaged in the mode without getting ridiculously bored, but long enough to allow players to get their placement matches done and play enough to maybe jump up a rank or two! 

* When a new season starts, I came up with [this concept on what the screen would look like upon logging in.](https://imgur.com/a/Wlm9IfG) 

**- Sixth: I noticed in that previous concept image you mentioned rewards. We need some incentive to play creative mode. What would this look like in Fortnite?**

It's a pretty good idea to creative an incentive for your players to play your new mode. While ranks themselves may be an incentive, for some, it's not quite enough of a reason to keep playing the mode. So here's some ideas!

* The way you could earn these wraps you'd earn could vary. My personal favorite solution is you'd receive a wrap for every rank. While I am not talented enough to create concepts for these weapons in Photoshop, there's a lot of talented people who have made concepts for weapon wraps that could be hypothetically earned through competitive mode.

* With the recent introduction of wraps, it would be cool to see some wraps you can only earn through playing the competitive mode. [For example, if you reach Gold rank, you'd get this wrap! This idea comes from the render that](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7sh2i7/suggestion_gold_skin_for_1000_kills_per_weapon/) u/haubna made!

* For instance, [see this awesome Loot Llama-inspired wrap concept created by](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a4uf75/loot_llama_inspired_wrap_hopefully_its_not/) u/madsbrads25515! This could (hypothetically) be the reward you earn from reaching Platinum rank.

* Or, [check out this insane diamond wrap created by](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a76yxs/a_lot_of_yall_yesterday_recommended_i_make_a/) u/BeastKiller109! This could obviously be the reward for reaching the Diamond rank.

* [These concepts that were made by](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a4ngf6/my_weapon_skin_concepts_psychedelic_is_my/) u/melodicdesigns_ could be some great rewards for Bronze, Silver, and etcetera.

* On top of wraps, Epic could also include sprays, emotes, or even backblings/gliders.

* If you have any idea on what kind of rewards you'd like to see in a Competitive mode, let me know!

**- Seventh: How would competitive mode matchmaking work? Would there be cross-play? Would new servers need to be made?**

* Of course, the actual implementation of this mode would be pretty difficult. Epic absolutely would have to create new dedicated servers which would be an issue because the servers they have ***NOW*** don't even function properly half the time. This would have to be a top priority before any implementation of a creative mode.

* Matchmaking in a competitive mode in my mind [would work like my concept that I posted earlier in this thread.](https://imgur.com/a/ZTpgIse) If you want to play competitive, switch the COMPETITIVE MODE: OFF button to ON, and you'll be queued with people that have the same option enabled.

* Epic could also create another ""box"" for the gamemode, just like they do with their Limited Time Modes. This would work well too, but I feel like having a Competitive Mode box for solos, duos, and squads would clutter the ""game select"" screen.

* As for crossplay, I think it should work just like it does now. If you have a cross-platform player in your party when you queue, you'd be matched up with other parties who have the same number of cross-platform teammates.

Now, I'm not saying this whole thing is an easy task for Epic to accomplish and I'm not saying ""Why doesn't Epic just do it?"" It would be absolutely be difficult to implement into the game but the impact it would have on the community would be massive, and I think it would be a positive one as well.

Like I said, this isn't a revolutionary idea. I just thought I'd share my idea on how the mode would look fleshed-out. Let me know if you have any feedback or things you would change personally. And thanks for reading, if you did!

TL;DR: why doesnt epic just make a ranked mode and copy overwatch's system lol",FortniteCompetitive

During season 3-6 my ping was around 55-70 and i know its not the best but it felt normal to me and i was happy with it. 

Recently, however my ping has been no less than 90 in pub and playgrounds, and over 100 for at least half of the time. With 5+ spikes to 150 per game. Im a self proclaimed playground warrior and i CAN NOT function with 90 ping, all my editing muscle memory from 60 ping is completely gone and probably 15% of my shotgun shots just dont register at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

ive never been more frustrated about connection to a game in my life, all the other games are fine, csgo is 60 overwatch is 70 rust is 60. And please do not suggest i change my isp i live in a rural area with nobody for miles and the only provider to my area is a verizon hotspot on my iphone 6s that is 4 years old (idk if phone age would fuck up the cell connection).

The answer is in your inventory setup. This may take getting used to, but it will be worth it. The setup is deag/pump/smg/misc./ar. It is a shame that you will have to drop a sniper, but deagles and ARs are more consistent. The deagle is arguably the most versatile weapon in the game. Snapshots on console can be devastating, and it is the best weapon for the break/replace strat. However, the p90 or normal SMG is MUCH better with consistent pressure and cleaning up kills.

My goal with this project is to a detailed review about every pro player. Based on a VOD that I find of them or one that they submit to me. I plan on doing a few of these a day. I am sorry if this is clutter, however if I can help one person then it's worth it in my opinion. 

Without further ado, let's go into an overview of Ghost Ghoul, one of the ICONS of supportive play in fortnite.

Video: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/357470641?t=01h40m03s


Video starts off by Ghoul identifying what they will do if they get contested.

Starts scouting around during glider phase of his deploy. 
Edgey calls target, Ghoul immediately goes for the angle. 

Identifies that Edgey did not give a locational call. Asks for where.
Edgey relays call, Ghoul knows exactly where the guy is. 
Goes for the shot and it connects. - Great supporting play. 
Thirsts for shield. 

Goes for the second guy. - Does not call location or damage values. 

All of this happens in the first 1:30 of the game. 

After that bit they loot and keep updating each other on their economies to make sure they both yield the same value. If the higher value player dies, then that economy is useless or even harmful if in the hands of the enemy. ""Don't put your eggs in one basket"" or whatever the saying is.

**1:45:00** they get done with looting and rotate with the budget plane technique.

They come to fatal, and try to farm up the brick and scavenge.


**1:46:00** they get pushed. Here we get to see how they handle being surprised.

*Instantly both players take height.*

This is where we begin to see ""new"" Ghoul vs ""old"" Ghoul. ""Old"" Ghoul - the supportive player; would have instantly gone to help Edgey and his 1v1. New Ghoul hunts for his own 1v1, and is confident that Edgey can win.

He rotates back to Edgey and doesn't want to get too greedy  and takes shields. This is probably from his supporting habits. It doesn't accomplish much. 

From **1:46:40** you get to see Edgey pick up the IGL role and relay information to Ghoul as he recovers.

*In this fight you get to see amazing status calls from Edgey.*

- ""I'm building up""
- ""I need to heal""
- ""I'm getting grappled on right now""

These are all bits of information that Ghoul needs, since this lets Ghoul know that his partner isn't with him.

He secures a kill for the shield and instantly asks for the status of Edgey's fight. He sees that his fight isn't finished and turns it into a 2v1.

**1:47:30** You can see Ghoul start to give micro calls. Which lead into an instinctual pinch play. 

Immediately after the fight they start to call economy to each other and then proceed to identify where they're being shot at. 


**1:48:30** You get to see Ghoul try to third person peek for information. He starts to aggress and gets information from Edgey while agressing that it's 2 people instead of 1.

**1:50:30** Edgey calls an enemies location. Ghoul instantly goes into pyramid peek mode to gain information safely.  - This is exceptionally useful since people can't hit him. Free information is the best information.

**1:52:35** This is a prime example on how you should peek Ghoul is not over exposed and not standing still so that a sniper can line up a shot on him.

Again at **1:53:47** You see these crouch peeks that are essentially perfect peeks. 

You can see throughout the vod instances like 1:54:58 where Ghoul will place a wall, to block off an angle and then take advantage of the new freedom that he's given himself to focus on another target. 

**1:55:15** Ghoul uses edits to gain angles that otherwise would not be able to be taken advantage of. If you look to see here: He can't be shot from that side. Where he knows there's an enemy. https://gyazo.com/74b9a66bd9f2f904b13933082261b50d

*-- I am assuming that his knowledge of damage zones comes from playing support in overwatch --*

**1:55:26** He re-evaluated his exposure and covered his back. Regaining your bearings is exceptionally important when in fights. 

**1:56:35** Identifies people rifting and knows that he can take free shots at those guys. This lowers the enemies economy and will make it easier for the enemies to lose fights. Sometimes fights CAN BE WON, by only shooting at people a few times. This is a prime example. If the people that Ghoul shot at didn't have any extra shields or anything and they got pushed by people with high economy. Then that's those guys more than likely losing the fight. If they die but they do a ton of damage to their aggressors, then Ghoul gets to easily win by killing the guy they did damage to. It's less shields in play. It's a Win - Win situation for Ghoul, as it costs him nearly nothing.  

**1:56:40** Understanding greed. Ghoul for as long as I've been spectating his play, has not been a greedy player at all. Instead of succumbing to greed here, you can see Ghoul take the time to make sure that he's okay angle wise, then continue firing. Gathering your bearings isn't like a radar that goes off every at the end of every fight. It should be a constant scan.

**1:56:55** Swaps targets taking advantage of his edit. Allows for multiple people to be shot at at once without being punished for it. Further lowering the global shield pool. 

**1:57:14** His brain blanked and he took fall damage because of it. Trying to get position early. 

**1:57:25** Hears his teammate needs help. Looks, shoots. Identifies that Edgey bit off more than he can chew and tells them to get out of there. 
Afterwards they immediately go into the scouting phase and evaluate the threat.

**1:58:08** Ghoul doesn't forget about the guys that were going to rotate into him. 

**1:58:38** We actually get to see a glimpse of greed come out here, just a really small bit,  he didn't wait for the FSA. The reason he didn't build first was because he didn't want to give away his position. He could've tried to find an angle with the metal and used that to hide his stairs and used that wall for cover, however that angle would expose him to the team behind and the people in front of him would be out of his Line-Of-Sight due to the tree. Best option there was to not peek that corner as in the open as he did and stick to the metal and treat it as a harsh left peek.

**1:59:40** During the chaos he doesn't forget about the two solos that were behind him. He goes to check in hopes that the guy is low from his fight and knowing that the solo player has to move.  

**1:59:50** He identifies a threat for his teammate.
His teammate identifies that they will more than likely lose highground and Ghoul states that he can retake height with the grappler charges that he has remaining.   

*That's exactly what he does. Once Ghoul has height Edgey can easily get up.*

**2:01:00** Ghoul drops down to search for an angle. He finds one. He sees the other guy has only one option, and then Ghoul sprays the guy's only exit. Either die to Ghoul or die to the storm.


# Key Points: 
Ghoul is a LOT more aggressive than he used to be. No longer calls direction and damage habitually. He also doesn't call when he's dropping down. Does not call hits either. Exceptional at understanding how to siege tempo with plays such as pinches and understands the value of equal economy in a duo setting really well. Understands his angles fairly decently and how to gain information. Does not call when he switches targets, however his duo does seem to understand Ghoul's target  importance. Which is pretty handy not gonna lie. Good stuff Edgey.

# What can we learn from Ghoul:
We're able to learn the way that he uses his angles and how he hunts for angles.
We're able to see the way that he plays around the damage zones to take the least amount of damage.
He's able to quickly finish his fights and often goes for pinch plays throughout the vod.
We can also see that Ghoul is playing much differently than he used to play; more aggressively with a supporting mindset (constantly thinking about his duo partner.)

This is my first guide like this that I have optimized for the public (all of my other ones were just notes for me to keep track of each players strengths and weaknesses) and I plan to do at least a few of these a day while I'm on my vacation since I can't stream. *I understand that this is from one game, however these are the key points that I think people can learn from about these ""average"" games that pro players play in.*

As always I am always available in my discord linked below for questions or in the comments below to answer questions.

I think I will do some EU player/s next.

Please support Ghoul with all of your kindness! He's such a nice human being and if you ask him questions he will 100% do his best to answer!

Today the planes spawn rate was reduced from 100% to 80%. This means each plane individually has 80% chance to spawn or not. 

If the website I checked is correct:

* 7 locations spawn 3 planes 
*  5 locations spawn 1 plane
* 1 location spawns 5 planes

In order to find the probability of at least a certain amount of planes spawning in a game we need to use binomial probability. This will result in a bell like graph with tails leading to the new average of planes spawning in a game. 

I used this site to get my results. (https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/bin.html) I will make a chart of notable spawns and percents.

Spawn # | Probability

At least # of Spawn | Probability | 
--------|---------|
19 | 0.83% | 
20 | 2% |
21 | 4.19% |

###Creative List of Practice Courses

Take a look of the megathread of all the current practice courses that we have at the moment. We will be updating it whenever we see a new Creator Map Code or if someone comments on the thread with a map of their own. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aal40k/creative_list_of_practice_courses_megathread/?

&amp;nbsp;

---

###Be Mature and Respectful

We know that sometimes we may not agree with FortniteBR and their views; however, that does not mean that it is okay to harass or bully another sub for their opinion. We will be removing any posts that are just screenshots of comments calling out a user. This will go along with a temporary 3 day ban from this subreddit. 

Make sure to also keep general suggestion threads in FortniteBR. We will be removing general suggestion posts and redirecting them to FortniteBR, but we will be keeping suggestions that are in line with the competitive nature of Fortnite. 

&amp;nbsp;

#Your Feedback!

We want to listen! We really appreciate this whole community and want nothing but to keep on improving it for our users here. We hear you and know where we mess up or what we are doing right. Don't be shy to call us out down below!

&amp;nbsp;

---

###Rules

How do you feel about our rules? Are they too strict, not strict enough or just about right? Do we need to remove or add any rules? Should the removal reasons be more specific when we remove a post or are they good enough just generally covering what rule the post broke? Please comment down below if you have any feedback regarding our rules and what you would like to see.

&amp;nbsp;

---

###Moderation

How are we doing? How's our moderating? Are we removing too many posts, or are we not removing enough. Do you think that there is a mod that is out to get you, is it that weirdo mod u/SeriouslyLucifer? We want to make sure that this sub is just as pleasant as it is for us so that it can be just as pleasant for you. If you feel like we are not doing enough or there are some improvements that we can work on, again please let it all out and let us know. 

Also, in order for us to get to a post quicker please use the report function as this puts the post in a separate page that we check frequently called the ‘Mod Que’. It’s very helpful as we sometimes do miss some posts that can reach the front page.

I don’t understand why everyone jumped on the duo, solo hype train and agreed with epic in their decision to not make squads competitive. It might be mob mentality but when I really thought about it and analyzed squads as a whole it just makes way more sense to me. Solos and duos can be super rng based because of many things such as bad loot off spawn, No shields, hard rotations and getting focused by multiple people at once. I believe that in a squads format it limits rng, because maybe you get bad loot off spawn and an enemy team is nearby. You can simply just back off and go to one if your teammates that got better loot and he could give you some items. If you got focused by multiple people in a solo game and die then that’s it it’s gg and there’s no going back. If you take that same situation in a squads game you might die but your team is still alive and have a chance at picking you up or if you get finished you can still root for your team to clutch it out for you. So basically the first point I am trying to make here is that the squads format majorly Reduces rng.
The next point I want to make is that having a team that works together well is not easy. The team aspect of the game adds an entire new skill gap to the game. If you look at other eSports titles like call of duty for example you may wonder why teams such as Optic dominate in every tournament. Well the answer is simple, they have chemistry like no other team in the competitive scene. They have 3 people who have won plenty of tournaments together and have been playing with each other for years. This really shows that the team aspect of the game is super important to being successful because honestly if you look at call of duty it’s not the game with the biggest skill gap. The only real skills in the game is movement, and primarily your aim. The rest of it comes from team chemistry and game knowledge. So bringing it back to fortnite the same things could be true and we could see teams like Faze dominate if they practice enough together. Things that we haven’t even seen before could be possible if everyone practiced squads. The synergized plays with proper communication could be super exciting to watch. 
The last few points I want to make is that squads would be the best for entertainment as well as statistically giving every team a better chance to win. So I want to touch on the statistics for a second. In solos you have a 1/100 chance (statistically, not realistically)to win the game. Just think of that for a second. In a pro lobby literally everyone at the beginning of the game is thinking to themselves “this is my game I’m better than everyone in this lobby”. What separates you from the next pro in the lobby? Also, what’s your luck gonna be like this game? You could end up getting screwed in countless amounts of ways whereas If you look at squads every team has a 1/25 chance to win the game. Those odds seem much better and would yield more consistent results on who the better teams are because of the points previously made where rng would be minimized. Now for the entertainment aspect, I’ve watched majority of the solo tournaments and I do enjoy them but think of how much action you miss. The kill feed is always going off and you have no idea what happened. That could be your favorite player dying or getting a sick ass kill in the killfeed but you have no idea what happened. With squads the action would be so much easier to follow and you might even see a pattern in fights as teams land in the same area every time. Stats could develop like Faze vs Ghost engagement victories 2-1 so far because maybe they land and loot up and then get into a fight early game every time. There’s endless amounts of possibilities that squads could bring to the competitive fortnite scene and if I said everything that was on my mind this would turn into a novel (which it already kinda is lol) but I’m going to wrap it up here and would love to see a discussion in the comments as to whether you agree or disagree with me and why ",FortniteCompetitive

I suggest EPIC to make sure the algorithm is designed so it takes into account multiple factors apart from simply placement and eliminations... mainly avg ELO of the lobby and ELO of the people you kill / people you are killed by.

Let’s start with a base system (this is assuming everyone who queues into the lobby has the exact same ELO):


**Each Elimination** 10 points

**Death** -11 points

(For below, you get the points based on what placement you die in, not cumulative)

**51-100th Place** -10 points

**21-50th Place** 0 points

**11-20th Place** 15 points

**6-10th Place** 30 points

**4-5th Place** 40 points 

**2-3rd Place** 50 Points

**1st Place** 60 points (not hugely rewarded over 2-3rd place because you don’t lose 20 points from dying which ultimately swings you 30 more points ahead from 2-3rd)

A system mentioned above works as there is a slight ELO decay across the lobby of approximately 60 points (.6 points per player per game on average would be lost in this system). 

Now since we don’t live in a perfect world, everyone’s ELOs will differ slightly within lobbies, which needs to be accounted for. My solution to this is to reward / punish kills and deaths proportionally to who you kill or are killed by. Killed by a higher ELO person? You lose less ELO by dying... and on the flip side gain more ELO if you end up killing him. On his end, he gets less ELO for killing you and loses more ELO for getting killed by you. 

For placements, similarly execute the aforementioned idea but simply take an average of the entire lobby’s ELO and adjust potential ELO gain/loss for placement accordingly. Average ELO of the lobby is higher than your elo? You lose less points by having bad placements and gain more points by good placement than you normally would in an average lobby. 

This system makes it harder and harder and harder to get more ELO the higher you get up and encourages a healthy slight decay to keep people somewhat close in rank once you get to the top of the leaderboards.

Imagine if there was ranked mode that ran 24hrs, how long ques would be for highest rank as an example. People play at different times and after some time many players would stop playing ranked.",FortniteCompetitive

325,itsGerth,1546884060,adk9g8,105,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/adk9g8/i_designed_a_potential_rank_mode_structure/,1,I Designed A Potential Rank Mode Structure,"First off just some stuff about me and why I decided to do this:

* Been around E-Sports for over 6 years
* Participated in many genre's competitive ladders (NHL, CoD League Play, H1Z1, LoL, Overwatch)
* Graduated from college with a degree in Game Development and wrote many papers on the structure and evolution of E-Sports
* I believe Fortnite E-Sports has insane amounts of potential

With that being said let's get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

**RANKS:**

*How would it work?*

* It would work with players progressing through a wide variety of tiers/ranks as well as a hidden match making rating system (MMR). The tiers/ranks would be more for showing their progression and their approximate skill level, while the hidden MMR would be use to specify their skill level, meaning if they constantly preform better they will face higher ranked players and progress through the ladder faster.

*How many Ranks?*

* I'd implement a 6 main rank system. Something like Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master/Challenger. Names don't matter, these are just to help visualize it.

*How many Tiers?*

* I think a 4 tier system would be a good fit due to the size of the player-base to allow for evenly skilled matches. However the top rank would not have tiers, it would contain say the top 250 players per server. Every time someone advanced to the top tier, the lowest ranked player in the top Tier would get automatically demoted to the Tier below. 

*How would the top Tier run?*

* To prevent players from being immediately removed from the top Tier upon achieving it due to someone achieving it directly after them, I feel like a point system should be put in place. Say when you achieve the top tier you start off with 1000 points, preforming well/preforming badly result in you gaining/losing points respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

**PROGRESSION:**

*How would you advance Tiers?*

* By playing well in games. I'll get into how I would lay out the scoring later on, but hypothetically you need to get 100 points in a game to move up a Tier. 

*How would you advance Ranks?*

* Once you're in the top Tier for your current rank AND you hit 100 points, you play 3 games to try and get a total of 70 points. This acts as a sort of promotional series to really earn your way to the next rank (ex. Bronze -&gt; Silver, Silver-&gt;Gold, etc). Upon doing so, you get promoted to the next rank. If you fail, you stay at your current rank/tier and get set to 50% completion of the Tier, so 50 points out of 100.

*Can you lose Tier points?*

* Yes, if you under-preform the average player in your rank you will lose points, the amount you lose will vary based on your performance. I will go over this more later

*Can you get demoted Tiers?*

* Yes and no. I do not believe you should be able to get demoted from say Silver to Bronze as everyone goes on bad streaks sometimes due to RNG and to potentially destroy someones rank as a result is bad for the competitive lively-hood.  However from hypothetically Gold and higher I would make it possible to get demoted to have players always trying their best and never give up. Yes, that includes Gold being able to demote to Silver.

*How does hidden MMR affect your Tier/Rank?* 

* If your hidden MMR is a lot higher than the average for your rank, you have a chance to skip Tiers/Divisions as a result. That means if you play well consistently, you will climb the ladder faster. However, if you lose consistently and your MMR is a lot lower then average for your rank, you have a chance to drop more Tiers/Divisions at a time as a result. Also, the match making system will take your MMR into account to make sure you're playing people with your true skill level instead of your displayed rank.

&amp;#x200B;

**SCORING:**

*How would scoring work?*

* After seeing feedback from how much people loved how the Winter Royale Qualifiers were ran, I decided to parody the scoring system after it but beef it up a little bit.
   * You must place in the top 40 players to be eligible to gain points
      * Victory Royale: 40 points
      * Top 5: 20 Points
      * Top 10: 10 Points
      * 3 Kills: +12 Points
      * 5 Kills: +12 Points
      * 7 Kills: +12 Points
* This means it is hypothetically possible to move to the next rank in a single game if you are in your promotional games, which I think we can all agree if you can rack up 7 kills and a win in a competitive setting against evenly matched players you probably deserve it.

*How would negative scoring work?*

* I understand the game has RNG and can make kills an unreliable modifier when it comes to performance. That is why you will not lose points for not getting any kills. However you will lose points for placing poorly. 
   * 100-90: -20 Points
   * 89-80: -15 Points
   * 79-60: -10 Points
* I believe this allows for a small amount of points to be taken away over time, as statistically if you are playing against evenly skilled players you should lose on average 4 points every 100 games. So you should seemingly stay in your same position, but it does affect you slightly just so no one gets permanently hard-stuck at a certain rank.

*What about scoring in the top Tier?*

* Like I stated earlier I feel like players should start with 100 points. Then they play by the same point system as every other rank/tier. There will not be a limit on the points a player can have so its an endless climb/battle to be rank 1 on your server. This allows Epic/Fortnite to recognize their top players, and reward them for being so. Whether it be a special skin for reaching certain ranks, or something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

**GAME MODES:**

* This draft is specifically around solo's, but it can and should be tweaked to fit Duo/Squad playlists as-well.
* This will be played with LIVE patches but MYTHIC items disabled. That way we play ranked on the latest patches and in game tuning, but with game breaking mythic items (sword, possible new dragon) AND planes disabled. Planes add a bit too much of an RNG aspect in terms of rotations, removing them adds another element of game knowledge being required to play well. Planes mean you can literally rotate anywhere quickly without having to use resources and being able to ignore terrain obstacles. Removing them from a competitive rule-set and making players have to learn rotations and deciding if its worth using mats to possible rotate on a safer path is worth it and will make games more game knowledge and skill based.

&amp;#x200B;

**KILLS VS PLACEMENT (incentive):**

* To incentivize kills there should be a reward in the form of health/shield. The amount is debatable but I believe 50 effective hit points is fair. That means 50 points added to your health and shields, but prioritizes health. Like a slurp juice, but instantaneous.
* To incentivize placement, I feel there should be some sort of reward for hitting each checkpoint where you get points. Say 120 mats (40 of each) for each mark.  That means if you make it to top 5, you would get 240 bonus mats (80 of each). It's not game-breaking, but still provides some sort of reward for placing well and playing well.

&amp;#x200B;

**REWARDS FOR RANKED (incentive):**

* I'm not too sure how the player spread will be in terms of players in each Tier, but the goal is to have say Gold be the top 30% of players or something. Reward the top 30% of players with something special such as a skin, and for Platinum/Diamond players get different variations of such skin as well as the reward for the ranks below them. The top Tier should get either a completely different skin OR a glider/emote/variation that matches each other to truely showcase their skill and accomplishment and inspire players to grind for the rewards.

**PRO-SCRIMS:**

* There should also be a TR or Tournament Realm implemented. This is a set of servers for organizations to play on that is NOT on live patches, and is actually on a patch behind. This allows for Epic to make sure game-breaking changes or bugs are not involved in the competitive scene. Scrims should be hosted on these servers to match tournament situations without stream snipers. Public scrims are still fine to do in a public match/quick-play for people wanting to try and follow that structure. 

**CONCLUSION:**

* I feel like this would be a good fit for Fortnite and its competitive scene. This would allow for all games to be competitive regardless of skill level, and give everyone a fair shot at gaining exposure as some of the best players in the world. It rewards people who constantly put up kills and wins, making average games not affect you, and punishes people who under-preform consistently. Any feedback is appreciated as its just something I came up within the past 2.5 hours. I'm looking forward to discussing this with you guys to see what you all think! :D

([https://youtu.be/J8GacJUru9I?t=267](https://youtu.be/J8GacJUru9I?t=2676)9) ""LYNX"".... there's an example as well of Saf gets Zayt to back off a target that he doesnt want to focus - ""NOT THAT ONE"" 
* Constantly setting up pinches - you'll see Zayt take massive flanking paths constantly in order to set up a pinch - and then. 
* Constantly setting up CROSSFIRES as well - same concept, but slightly different angles, Zayt is usually the guy who focuses on setting these up, whereas Saf puts down the fort. Even when the a solo makes the correct play and tries to get in one of their faces - they are able to just instinctively know what to do and stay out of harms way until the other player can then flank. 
* Zayt is a god at looking INTO the zone in order to find the next play for height - we saw multiple examples of this throughout the VOD... biggest example was during his 1v2 in Game 5.
* Endgame - ""Leave this solo alive"", haven't heard this call, but super self-explanatory and good awareness to spot that he's even a solo... obviously it causes their highground to be even better, by forcing the players lower to fight each other. FREE TEAMMATE :D
* Patience - regrouping if a poor situation happens. In game 1, the last solo rifted on them and they lost it because saf was low ground - but saf said just come down, zayt ends up dropping a bit and then keeping his pump out looking up and tells saf just to shoot him out rather than having to go down himself, much safer for Zayt.
* Alternating people who carpet versus people who shoot, both equalizing mats/ammo/health and also giving time to reload and refresh, meaning close to 100% uptime on shots from highground. Super efficient.
* ""Forking Carpet"", once they are safe, they carpet out away from each other to get different angles.
* With pop-up settings, its super obvious in retrospect, but if you knock someone in a 2v2 endgame, before going after the 2nd guy, just wait for the shields and mats, this call won them game 3.
* JUST BECAUSE Its a 2v1 endgame doesnt mean you stop playing patient, stop pinching and stop trying to get multiple angles, zayt and saf show that this is the cleanest way to win without risk.
* ""Shoot top"" - good comms on how to setup the pinch on a player turtling.
* When getting pushed and you dont really want to fight, zayt does a really good job delaying them while saf gets what he needs, and then constantly loops back to scout if they have the opportunity to get shots or if they are continuing to fight.
* Endgame rift/launchpad: Tanking zone, building height from out of zone, while teammate stays in the air, and then lands on your build, SOLID.
* FIND THE CRACKS - endgame when you have no mats… allows you to sneak away and become hard to find, buying you time to do what you need to do... the cracks near edge of zone or on the sides of builds.
* Zayt 1v2 - switching up the angle in the final 1v1 on Posick is something that secures him that win, Posick trying to deagle from low ground, much harder to hit a 1 shot onto Zayt if he is constantly switching his angle - also, leaving that edit open is important.
* Comms: Acknowledgements are severely underrated, these guys are constantly making sure they are acknowledging each others calls.
* Splitting loot lake for free uncontested is actually INSANE. INSANE.

In summary: 

These guys have insanely good chemistry, patience, targetting, positional play. Every single one of their games they got to endgame because they won all their fights easily because of all of the above. This has been one of the better duos I've seen at setting up their pinches and crossfires. 

If you want timestamps for the VOD review, here they are, keep in mind I jumped from early cup to late cup and the games are not in order of how he played them but in order of how I reviewed them.

This time; Floor Loot.

Too many times have I ran through a multilevel house just to pick up some ammo and mats, mats are nice and all but I'd prefer something to fight back with.

So here is the idea I want feedback on;

Instead of having chests drop gray weapons, why not have them be locked to green+. I think this would be good so you're not opening the same gray items over and over again. Then have floor loot be more likely to be a gray weapon than ammo/mats, because if your house happens to have no chest you will still have a gun to fight back with.

I think the way it should work is something liek overwatch. You reach a certain amount of mmr you go up a rank. Etc. The amount of mmr you gain or lose should be based off your placement not kills. Everyone should be trying to WIN, not W key warriors.

For example I think this would be great. (This is example)
If you die between (100-50) you lose 50 elo.
(49-26) you lose 25 elo.
(25-10) lose 15 elo.
(10-3) gain 30, 2nd place 50, 1st places 100 elo.
I think you should gain in this situation 5 elo for each kill.

This is just a thought, yes the elo amount could very well be adjusted better but showing an example. I think this could honestly be such a good system.

388,oomnahs,1546816989,adb93k,38,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/adb93k/clearing_a_misconception_competitive_players_are/,1,Clearing a misconception - Competitive players are not &lt;1% of the playerbase,"I see this statistic thrown around that only &lt;1% of the playerbase is competitive. I want to explain why this statistic is misleading. TL;DR at bottom.

Let's start by defining playerbase. If we're talking about the **total** playerbase, as in the total amount of people who have ever played fortnite, then it is true that only &lt;1% of them make up the competitive population. However, it is more important to consider the **active** playerbase, because the active users are the ones that come back to the game week after week and the ones likely to frequently consume Fortnite content. My grandfather who downloaded Fortnite on his phone once is considered a player, but he is not considered an active player. According to [this](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fall-skirmish-details) blogpost, Fortnite saw **73.8 million players** in August alone, and [this](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/fortnite-vs-pubg-map-players-graphics-gameplay-weapons-review) source suggests an average active monthly playerbase of around **40 million players**. These are the numbers we should be using.

Now let's define what competitive means. A competitive player is someone who **1)** is trying to improve on their skill, **2)** is interested in higher level play, **3)** wants to play against opponents of similar skill level, or a combination of the three. It's important to realize that competitive **does not** mean pro level, it is possible to be competitive without wanting to play at the highest level. You **do not** have to be skillful to be a competitive player, and likewise you do not have to be a bad player to be casual. If you're interested in competition among other players that makes you competitive.

Winter Royale had **9.2 Million players** [source](https://i.redd.it/k4463u8e7p121.png). It is important to realize that of that 9.2 Million, a **large portion** of those people were likely casual players testing out a new mode. However, we can say that the majority of the players in the WR were at least interested in competitive play enough to try it out, regardless of skill level. Casual players would not have been interested in competition and would have likely avoided the tournament. If you are a casual player and you willingly took part in this tournament because you are interested in competition, that makes you a competitive player.  

TL;DR - The Winter Royale showed us that a large portion of the active playerbase is competitive. Skill level and amount of interest in competition does not matter, if someone is interested in competition among other players, that makes them competitive. ""&lt;1% of the playerbase is competitive"" is false.",FortniteCompetitive

I can’t imagine getting kamikazed by 4 sweaties is a good experience for new/ casual players. This same theory applies to health/shield for kills. The counter argument to health for kills is that it puts bots at a huge disadvantage. This implies that a large portion of the player base is completely incapable of ever getting a kill. If someone isn’t very good, they still will pick up the occasional kill, but may take more damage while getting that kill than an experienced play would. So of course they would benefit from getting health from picking up that kill.

Build fights actually happened. Shotguns used to be meant for mediocre damage 3-6 times, like the heavy is. Snipers do 100+ among explosives. There should not be exceptions for common shotguns, they’re everywhere and way too painful. Fortnite is now more of a causal game than ever.

So I recently created a video [(here's the link if you're interested)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5DSfKeilfs) for tips/strategies that can potentially help a viewer improve at pop-up cup in Fortnite... in terms of macro/rotations/decisions/evaluating options during a game. In this particular episode, I focus on winning particular skirmish scenarios and 1v1 fights. I got pushed relentlessly by careless players (which can be more dangerous than smart players), and you can see how I deal with that in this VOD review. Decisions you make can single-handedly decide whether you win a match or not.

**Summary of points in this video:**

* Why Lonely Lodge is a BETTER alternative to Dusty Divot
* How to play the early game to set yourself up for success in the top 10.
* How to take advantage of mushrooms to give yourself extra shield later on.
   * Example of Ghost Bizzle's habits in Dusty Divot of this \^\^
* Why dropping SMG for splodes is valuable
* Role of planes in the current meta
* How to play 1v1v1 scenarios in the middle game
* Splode tip to break turtles close-range, but safely. (credit to u/ImSpeedyGonzalez)
* Importance of Grapplers and Rift-to-go's in the endgame
* How to rotate circle-to-circle that benefits your immediate needs (ie. missing HP, missing mats, etc.)
* How to deal with players who hyper-aggressively push you
* Importance of MAT CONSERVATION.
   * This helps you in the endgame in top 5, or top 3, or top 2.
   * Could be the difference between a win or a loss.
* Using OTHER players in your vicinity to keep you safe
* Using big trees to give you cover from people on high ground
* When to go for kills vs. When to rotate (in endgame)
* Knowing when to give up high ground (and play low ground instead) for a better chance of winning

In any given scenario in Fortnite, there's always many decisions that one can take, but usually ONE is the most ""correct""/optimal play. I'd like to think that I'm an above average Fortnite player so I want to give back to the community, encourage discussion, and explain the way that I play so people can understand the game better, and ultimately improve. **Feel free to disagree and challenge my ideas too! I'm not perfect, I can be wrong as well.**

That's the whole point of the ""Inside the Mind of Zykoma"" series, where I think out loud, so that viewers can hear my thoughts vocally, and understand the thought processes behind my decisions and the reasons for why I'm playing the way I am, with the hope that they benefit from it.

I just wanted your guys' feedback on how I can improve the series in future episodes so that I can help the viewers the most. This can be anything from criticizing the format of the video, the video length, my voice is too quiet... etc. Anything goes.

Any positive feedback is appreciated too, so that I can continue focusing on that part of the series and work hard to keep it in the series! Also, if the video ended up helping YOU guys improve your Fortnite, let me know!

Appreciate every bit of feedback I get here :) I'll be replying to every single one!

However, I was watching Nick eh 30 stream because I knew he used mouse wheel up for use. He was able to get out of the plane from the main seat. I don't know if he has a different bind for vehicle exit or what.

I'm not sure if anyone knows how to get a workaround for this, because I want to use mouse wheel up for vehicle exit. I have tap to search on if that affects getting out of planes, I'm not sure. If anyone can help at all, thanks in advance.

Epic have wrongly let mob mentality strike again, as [/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR) , alongside there mods allowed posts encouraging the hounding of Epic employees.

Why you may ask... Epic have no obligation to return the 14day challenges, they have been backed into a corner by this [/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR) cry-arsing.

That said if you are in the boat whereby you've not completed the challenges, then lets look at your options.

1. 14 days of Fortnite (clue in the title)
2. In game timer
3. Move on
4. Complain Epic communicated false information

A fair few within this community ran with option 4 so lets address that.

\-Epic employee stated on [/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR): 'IIRC' (If I recall correctly) proceeding to state the date he thinks the challenges would finish.

'False information' if he stated as fact it finishes x,y,z date its false information but he didn't.

That said, [u/spazinski](https://www.reddit.com/u/spazinski) has been hounded upon for communicating to the community - called out for lying etc etc.

If you feel its a form of miscommunication that does not in anyway condone the tactics/mob mentality employed by the vocal majority of this community \[ [/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR) \] to get there own way. It's a degree of bullying in my opinion and the mods have let it slide.

Lets screenshot someone, call him a liar, and everyone jumps aboard upvoting it. It's disgusting, and its wrong you feel thats the right way to deal with potential complaints.

1. Instead of going for the aggressive early game they seem to remain passive until they are forced into a fight at around 50 players remaining.

2. Mr savageM and his partner have excellent communication which is shown in there first fight by Bloodx suggesting to stink bomb the enemy turtle.

3. Another important thing the duo does is knowing when to contest and disengage for example when they decide to rush the players on height, after the cleanup they decide to knock the fight down a level and base on top of the pre existing builds.

4. They then are rewarded by the pressure they used and decide to take non contested shots on rotating players.

5. They then proceed to wait on the high ground and shoot down a drop. The storm then forced them to rotate from the edge of the circle to a mountain across the zone. They use a heavy sniper tag to distract players as they rotate to next zone.

6. As they are rotating savage goes for height and contests it. It is good he contested it because his duo partner Bloodx is being pressured by another nearby duo. As he is being pushed savage shoots at them from his high ground position. He then tells blood to rotate up because of the unfavorable position on the low ground he is contesting.

7. Mr savageM and Bloodx reset the fight. As they begin pushing again blood throws a stink which knocks one and they easily clean up the fight.

8. As they are rotating to zone savage is always watching other players and decides to shoot at some distant enemies. But another great example of communication from blood who tells him to help him with the guys in front of them.

9. Savage and blood are forced into the middle of enemy towers and are trying to pressure from Every angle they can, Because of this pressure they take height. But blood breaks it down to kill an enemy. This leads to savage being taken to low health but thanks to quick thinking and a grappler he escapes to the high ground.

10. Another key point is there rotate out of storm zone. Savage uses a grappler to try and get height. He is built over and uses his rpg to break the enemy down. Which results in high ground for both teamates.

11. Blood and savage keep the high ground and as the circle shrinks pressures players on each level dropping down as each layer is clear. They finish the game with a nice victory royale.

KEY POINTS

1. Stay passive for most of early game.
2. Have expert communication
3. Have good game sense (engage/disengage)
4. Preasure players always
5. Try to keep high ground
6. Keep good position by rotaing to high and low ground
7. Reset fights if you are being pressured
8. Stay calm under pressure
9. Try to rotate Safely with the goal to get high ground
10. Clear out the enemies layer by layer if you have high ground if not try to remain aggressive and turtle when necessary

Mainly because it seems to be that the consensus is to ""test items on the casual mode"".

Am I really the only one here who enjoys playing against various levels of skill, without having to deal with all the unbalanced additions? I do not want to either sweat constantly or to play an unbalanced casual mode. I just want a balanced Battle Royale experience without constantly added items and nerfs to building that ruin the skill-gap.

I think the original idea of testing various items and nerfs on LTM's was the right thing to do. Not force feed ranked mode, while simultaneously ruin the regular mode by making it a dumping ground for unbalanced and untested garbage. ",FortniteCompetitive

I notice streamers like Daequan make perfect decisions all the time, after I see him get a kill sometimes I think to myself “Wow, that kill was made so easy due to the fact that he went around the house and ramped up”. 

I don’t know how to emulate good decision making myself since just about every scenario is different/unique. I guess my main questions are, what’s the strategy after you land on a house and loot it in say salty springs? Where should you go during a fight that is inside of a house or around one? Where should I even ‘be’ during a match? Where do you usually rotate/go to in a match and why?

Any help is greatly appreciated. ",FortniteCompetitive
494,Veinn,1546656794,acpxu3,26,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/acpxu3/controller_players_could_really_use_more_custom/,1,Controller players could really use more custom binds.,"Ever since Epic added the ability to assign custom binds to controllers the console player base got a lot better and more comfortable playing in crossplay lobbies. Now, as much as I'd like to say that it's great and all...it's not enough. 
I play mostly on a controller, but I happen to pick up a mouse from time to time and I think about the differences, advantages and disadvantages of both quite often. 
To me, one of the most beneficial aspects of playing on a mouse and keyboard, that is not available on controllers while it could be, is the ability to switch to a certain weapon slot at any given time. When I play on PC, I have every single slot assigned to a specific button like Q or E which makes it very comfortable. Playing on a controller requires you to always keep track of the slot you are currently on because the only way to switch guns is by scrolling through them. This usually isn't too big of a deal. I always keep my shotguns between SMG's and Grapplers/RPG's so I only have to click once to get to the other one. However, in some scenarios, it gets you killed. 

Pictures this: You're playing a scrim game. You boxed yourself in a top 5 situation. Only 15hp and nervous af. Palms are sweaty, knees weak and all that stuff. Someone spams one of your walls while you try to heal up with the last two bandages you have. You quickly rebuild the wall and add a ramp for additional cover. You immediately turn around to edit through the wall on the other side but you mess up the edit. The enemy is already inside with you and is spamming like his p90 had a mag of 1000 bullets. You're forced to pull out your gun to fight, even though he fired first and is likely to win. Excuse me, what?!? You left the edit mode but you still can't shoot. NO NO NO MAMMA MIA NOT BANDAGES!!! HOLY JESUS WHERE IS MY SHOTGUN?!?!
Theoretically you could just look at the bottom right corner of the screen to see how many times you have to click your bumper to switch to your shotty, but there's just no time for that in a hectic situation. Before you realize what just happened, you’re dead. It's something for the muscle memory to take care of while you focus your attention on the bastard trying to kill you. 

I know that controllers have a limited number of buttons but most players don't utilize all of them. Also, there are a few ways to optimize the button mapping. And honestly... I only need 1 bind. Just let me take out my shotgun with a click of a button. That is all I need.

I’m a full time Unreal Engine dev myself so I know that it’s not hard to implement. Epic, please.

As a result of this adding the mechanic to pubs would do much more harm than good because lesser players would almost never be able to get kills now and then let alone win, I've had this opinion for a while and Tfue just reassured my suspicions. We need a ranked mode and we need to keep that mechanic strictly in ranked/comp modes. The moment they add popup mechanics to pubs is the moment Fortnite takes a major hit preference wise from 99% of its playerbase. And to be honest I doubt epic is dumb enough to undermine its biggest demographic.  Shield per kill in regular matches would just promote pubstomping anyways which isnt what the majority of this sub is into.",FortniteCompetitive

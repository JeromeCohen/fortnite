2,LoCKedCS,1527028119,8le8nl,23,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8le8nl/double_pump_should_not_stay/,43,Double Pump should NOT stay.,"Double Pump still gives players like me who have played before 3.0.0 flashbacks of a meta that made it so every other person who wasn't using the insta-killing monstrosity of a combo was at a HARD disadvantage. 

Now, it's back. Intentional? Maybe. Yet the chances of this are extremely slim as just [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7yepxv/pump_shotgun_reload_changes/) we had an update on this subreddit from EPIC saying

&gt;Many of you have shared feedback with us regarding Pump Shotguns. Thank you! Your input helps shape the future of Battle Royale and we greatly appreciate your comments and concerns.

&gt;The Pump Shotgun‚Äôs high damage is balanced by its long reload time, and bypassing that weakness makes the weapon stronger than intended.

&gt;So, with the upcoming release of 3.0.0, we are making an adjustment to the Pump Shotgun behavior. If you fire the Pump Shotgun and quickly switch weapons, the next time it‚Äôs selected it will be forced to pump before firing again. This feature will only be enabled for Pump Shotguns, but we will closely monitor other weapon types for similar concerns.

&gt;Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to seeing you in Season 3!

Now I've seen a lot of players on this subreddit saying that they're ""Glad it's back"" or the player should just ""Use double pump."" 

The reason why they removed it in the first place is BECAUSE no other weapon combination came close. A pump shooting nearly as fast (or faster) than a tac shotgun is absurd, no matter the slot given up. 

This slot being used up isn't enough to justify keeping it in the game, as most fights between two good players usually end up being a build battle which ends in a shotgun battle or just a simple shotgun battle. 

Double pumping completely breaks the pump. A weapon that can do 230 damage in one shot shooting at tac level speeds is clearly overpowered. If you don't use it, using any other shotgun close range will get you killed. It's almost exactly like it was just 3 months ago.  In a game dominated by people building huge ramps to try and gain the high ground in a close range battle against an opponent, this has no place. 

I'd really love to debate some of the people who say its balanced.   Give me your best points FOR double pump. ",FortNiteBR

Mid range fights you have to rely on getting a sniper kill pretty much, because AR's are usless if the opponent builds.

By adding a delay between placing buildings once one is broken mid range fights would be much more prevalent and viable. As it is though, one person is wasting bullets and the other is wasting mats in mid range fights. There is no real fight actually happening.

We all want to get our challenges done and when Epic makes such silly challenges we need to work together to get them done, not screw each other match after match just for a kill, or lack there of. I know the point of the game is killing each other, but from my observations it‚Äôs been pretty obvious when someone is looking for a challenge or whatnot. 

Example: someone runs at your tower shooting you, they probably aren‚Äôt trying to get a challenge complete and you should shoot them 22 times with a shotgun for 9 damage. 

Example 2: someone runs past you on the third circle and doesn‚Äôt fire a shot or anything, probably trying to complete the challenge. 

TLDR: be nice sometimes. 


Go ahead and downvote me for not understanding the point in challenges or the game in general.

Simply put: 

Ranked mode causes an extreme amount of stress. This causes people to burnout. This happened to me, and many of my friends in Overwatch and Clash Royale, both games that we played just as much as fortnite. The current game modes are currently engaging and fulfilling as is, and doesn‚Äôt cause much anxiety (except maybe at the end of games).

Ranked modes cause extreme toxicity within the community, even in solo modes. Friends will get extremely angry at one another when playing duos and squads. Is that really what Epic wants? To have people get consistently angry at their game? The game becomes synonymous with stress.

To those people who will say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt play competitive mode then.‚Äù

Good luck, everyone in the community would get dragged into playing competitive by the playerbase telling them that they are only good if you play competitive modes. Everyone will also be dragged into competitive because there will undoubtedly will be end of season rewards for playing (which might be the only positive of all of this). The game would become a sweaty camp-fest where every single player is playing extremely conservatively, even if kills grant points as well because no matter what, wins would be what granted the most points. The game would be played slower, changing what everyone has loved about it.

Final conclusion:

I‚Äôve played games with ranked mode. They all ended with me and my friends getting stressed and eventually leaving the game. Fortnite has a unique game where it is already fulfilling and exciting without ranked mode. Don‚Äôt ruin it.",FortNiteBR

Around the 10th of May 2018 I was playing with some friends \( 1 is a streamer \) and I started getting kicked due to ""lag,vpn,cheat"" I dont lag \(49 ms on the server\) I never used a vpn on my life I never cheated or even tried to

After I got kicked over and over again i tried to re\-install fortnite but still the same problem, all of a sudden the next day my account got disabled and i cant even play on a level 1.

I email the support team but they always write me the same automated message.

""You were observed using cheats"" which is a lie I garantee you that the vod on my friend stream is still there.

Can you please help me? I know you are kinda busy but there are A LOT of players on the forums complaining about this, im 24 almost 25 I don't cheat I don't really see the point in it, and why would i cheat after i got battle pass.

Ty for ur time.",FortNiteBR

Sure they might make really early engagements more interesting, but let's not pretend anyone is going to use them late game.

Everyone is forced to carry a shotgun, an AR, and some form of shield/healing.  That leaves TWO inventory slots.  Assuming you're going to want to use one of those slots for one of the other guns in the game, that leaves you one slot.  What does every single streamer fill that slot with?  Another healing/shield item and that's because that's the smartest move.  You know you're going to need it at some point, all the nades and now these backpack items have some utility but are situational.  I love the updates to the C4, they're so good at busting out turtles, but I'll toss it on the ground to pick up a shield pot and it sucks, but I know it's the best move because I will absolutely use that shield pot later in the game.  Same for clingers, they're so much fun but guess what, I'm dropping it for a med kit.

Epic keeps making changes and adding items because they want to keep the game play fresh.  Guess what, this is still the same shotgun / ar meta it was in season 1 and that's because of the inventory system.  

My suggestion is don't make the backpack item take up a slot, that makes no sense, give it a dedicated slot.  We're wearing it, not carrying it, and it's mostly a passive item.  Then remove one of our inventory slots, you heard me, and replace it with a grenade slot.  Sure it will suck only having 4 general slots but you know what that's going to do?  Force people to make a decision on that shotgun/ar combo and you will see people choose different load outs because of it.  Then having a dedicated grenade slot will make it so everyone has one of those fun tossable items at all times, you're going to see A LOT more impulse plays along with people carrying C4 breaking towers left and right late game.  I've been playing since season 1 and the game is still fun, but let's not pretend it isn't starting to stagnant some because the game play has essentially stayed the same.  If epic wants these new items to change the meta and keep the game fresh, they must address the inventory system.",FortNiteBR

I have a great PC, only a few months old. I‚Äôve been playing Fortnite for about 4 months, and it‚Äôs been great. The game runs smooth and feels perfect. I usually get 200-300+ fps constantly and play on a 144hz 1ms monitor and 20-30 ms server ping.

But lately the game has felt unplayable. It‚Äôs like I am getting 200 fps but it feels like I‚Äôm playing on 30fps with a 60hz monitor. The game slows down a lot and everything becomes sluggish and slow the more I get into fights. I can see that the game even looks slower on my screen, although when I look at my screen it‚Äôs meant to be high fps. I also get small stutters every 5 or 10th second almost as if I‚Äôm getting lag spikes/ fps drops. But the thing is my FPS never drops and it stays on 200+. When the game feels slower, it also feels like my mouse and keyboard inputs get lag too. It feels heavy. Before, i literally had instant response time and everything felt smooth and clean. Is anyone else getting this or am I alone? Is it the game or my PC? (My friend who also gets high fps has explained that he get‚Äôs the same thing)

My PC Specs are:
- i5 8600K
- MSI 1080 GTX Gaming X
- 2x4 GB Corsair RAM

My temps are fine and usually lay on around 55-70 degrees (the wheather in Sweden is very warm right now)

I don‚Äôt know exactly why or when this started happening but I am pretty sure it was after one of the latest patches or the latest Windows update, it‚Äôs been happening for about 1-2 weeks.

I‚Äôve tried following, nothing helped:
- Updating latest GPU drivers
- Turned on V-Sync
- Playing in WindowFullscreen mode
- Set cpu priority to High instead of Medium
- Lowered and Highered video settings
- Verified the Fortnite client
- FACTORY RESET PC (Reinstalled Windows and deleted everything)

Could this be happening because I need more RAM, I only play on 8 right now and considering I have a gtx 1080 it might be too little? (but then my FPS shouldn‚Äôt be high?) 

If not, it could just be the game, something they did in a patch or something. I seriously hope I am not the only one experiencing this, because I‚Äôve spent so much money on this PC to be able to play this game on high frames and get fast gameplay. Please let me know if you experience the same thing as me.",FortNiteBR

This is my first post up in this beezy, just wanted to know how you guys feel about the Leviathan skin and more specifically for those of you who dislike it; what about it makes it unappealing to you? Before going further understand that I am a cosmetic junkie in all video games. I don't play Dark Souls. I play FASHION Souls. It's not Fortnite: Battle Royale. It's Fortnite: SKINS Royale. I derive enjoyment from unique cosmetics. So yes. This is what I am spending my time talking about, and when I play the game; it is what I am focusing on grinding BP tiers for. And what I am saving little pockets of hobby money for. You can't really say anything that is going to degrade me or make me feel bad about this. Do that somewhere else. Now that I've gotten that out of the way... back on topic. 

In my defence of the skin; I have said that the back bling is unique and the asymmetry is a nice change from most symmetric blings. I also think the color scheme is poppin. White and gold is classy. Blue and green is fun. Brushed steel is a great accent. I also believe he has some pretty nice animations that most other 2k VB skins are not afforded. And not to mention that he literally has a free floating fish. In the place of a head. Need I say more about that? Not much to complain about from where I am looking. 

But, at least from my limited interaction in the community; people have almost unanimously shown dislike for him. So what are the things you guys see, if you don't mind my asking. Head too bulky? Too goofy? Is he just not thicc enough in the right places? Is it because it isn't edgy enough? Is it too edgy? Is something just fishy here? (Don't ban me.) Lemme know so I can stop wondering! Please!

Also, as far as other stuff I like about him besides the base skin: his back bling is perfect for Snorkel Ops, and he looks great dropping onto the island with the Jolly Roger and whipping out the Bottom Feeder to show those wood pallets who's boss. 

It doesn't affect me one way or another personally how people feel about the skin. Just wanted to ask around and see why my boy Levi isn't getting as much love as I thought he might. As for me I will still use him and love him. 

Much love, guys. See you on the island.

Assuming they run on gas/petrol or some kind of Fortnite Fuel, it would be fitting for the current gas stations littered around the map (Pleasant Park, Greasy Grove, Lucky Landing, Salty Springs, Tomato Town)  to allow for a refill for jetpacks. This interaction could be similar to a vending machine, where the player interacts with the fuel pumps at the gas stations and performs a resource trade for jetpack fuel. 

If a player obtains the jetpack during the early game, it heavily benefits that player through mobility, yet it does not reward opposing players for a kill. If the opposing player is able to kill the jetpack player, it would be fair to allow the opposing player to be able to refill a portion of jetpack fuel through this interaction. 

This type of fuel resource could also open up future avenues of development and ideas in Fortnite. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

His excitement to show progress in the game he enjoys was completely wrecked.  He started to ask why do people only comment mean things towards him?  Guys...maybe it's just me, but it hurt when I read the comments.  His whole attitude on the thread changed from ""Look I'm learning thanks for the help!"" to embarrassment.  It was made worse because it just didn't stop.

I know that 90% of online interactions are trash... and I know he will need to understand this one day too... but guys, give the kids a break please.  If they are trying to play the game,  not constantly yelling into the mic,  and being helpful try to be kind to them.  It really does go along way when a child has a good interaction on this game.  You never know how their day has been and sometimes just playing fortnite is their only escape. 

Hope everyone has a good day today!

I have two main questions, regarding FOV (and sensitivity) and Keybinds.

I mostly play FPS games, so the Third Person perspective of this game throws me off a bit.

I don't know if anyone here knows, but do we know the FOV of the different perspectives in this game? Like Unscoped FOV, ADS FOV, and Scoped FOV? And how would the third person perspective affect the screen in Unscoped and ADS? I know these are very trivial things but I really like getting my settings right for games.

Second question is relating to keybinds. Currently I'm using UHJK for movement (basically WASD), Right Alt to scope, V to crouch, C to sprint, Scroll Up to reload, Left Click to shoot, and Right Click to jump. Other than that, I haven't really set out on any keybinds. I'm considering using 67890 for buildings and some combination of my extra mouse buttons for weapons/items, but I'm open to try anything. 

I guess I'm not so much concerned about what I bind to actions, but what actions there are to bind. I don't want to play and not realize I can rotate buildings or whatever because I didn't set a button to it.",FortNiteBR

Every week they add more and more guns and that‚Äôs fine, I feel like people should have a hard choice picking their guns. 

But all the new utility items being added too is where it becomes complicated, portaforts, clingers, c4, backpacks, all the healing and shield items now etc etc. I feel like 3 gun slots and 3 utility slots is how this game needs to be - otherwise we end up in this situation where stuff gets added but no one really uses it after the novelty wears off because it‚Äôs useful, but not useful enough to want to give up a slot for. 

That‚Äôs how things like the smoke grenades ended up in the vault, they‚Äôre a useful item but with only 5 slots they‚Äôre not useful enough to pick over other things. 

I don‚Äôt wanna make the game easy, it should be tough to choose your loadout but the amount of stuff they have added in my view makes it necessary to add a 6th now - the core loadout of what people actually use has not changed much since the game released if you think about it for those who have been here since the start. 

TL;DR The high number of utility items being added to the game now require a 6th slot.

I'm talking from 2-4 kills on average per game to 6-10, which for me is solid.

I feel like I don't need to spend half my effort using my arm to turn to see if someone is coming and that by itself is a huge help, but it seems my accuracy is also more on point.

I have a simple trick on how to hit head every time no matter what distance:

&gt;0-50 meters = **Crosshair straight to the head**

&gt;75 meters = **Aim first line on the neck**

&gt;100 meters and up = **Aim third line on the hips**

If you don't know how to tell distance, you can do it with the scope. Start by aiming the middle of the crosshair just on top of your target's head and see how many lines fit inside the player model:

&gt;0-50 meters = **8 lines**

&gt;75 meters = **6,5 lines**

&gt;100 meters = **4,5 lines**

&gt;150 meters = **3 lines**

&gt;200 meters = **2,5 lines**

&gt;250 meters = **2 lines**

TLDR; If you are very close, you don't need to worry about bullet drop. For longer distances you just need to aim the 3rd line on the nuts and you'll get a headshot!

Two, you could possibly make a million dollars from all the people buying it because it is such a requested and rare outfit. And for all the OGs out there that don't want it to come back you are overreacting.

Spelt my email with one less z then intended. Didn't realise until Season 4 and now am locked out after forgetting my account password.

Hi all,

So recently I wanted to change my display name in Fortnite. So I went to the website and it was greyed out asking for a email verification. So I clicked send. Checked my email, nothing there. I quickly skimmed over my email and it LOOKED the same. I then signed out thinking this was a bug. I tried to sign back in in the launcher but to no avail. I then read every letter out to my  self. I then realised that I had missed a letter in my email. Supposed to be 3 ""z"" not 2. The email with two ""z"" doesn't exist. I then created it to see if that works but it didn't. So I was wondering if it's possible to access my account again or transfer it to the new one I had made because I have made purchases. 

Thanks!",FortNiteBR

Y'know, that PvE mode sure is something, isn't it? A load of fun, neat and organized, and for the most part, kind and forgiving. Some of you go to great lengths to welcome newer players into it, and for that, you have my Gratitude, and loyalty out in the storm.

However, some of you are less respectable when it comes to the PvE modes. You know the types. Made a promise, offered loot for materials, or vice versa, and then they take your stuff and run. We all had it happen once or twice. So, here's what I'm gonna do about it.Since the devs won't allow this behavior to be reported for the PvE, what I'm gonna do is write down every scammer I meet here, and any proven scammers put in the comments below. I'll compile a neat little list of all the offenders, so anyone looking to know who the scammers are can find them. Sure, we could ignore them, but then they win. We all know we want the victory royale for ourselves, right? So let's be the last one standing.

List start:FlippityHeckity; Promised weapons for building materials. DC'd when he got the materials.

At this point with the whole building meta, nobody should be able to effectively double pump you if you‚Äôre building. I use double pump and rarely get the second shot off if the opponent is competent/aware. 

Look at the streamers. They rarely get double pumped. Why? Because they‚Äôre building cover constantly. Thy build for defense just like they build for offense.

I‚Äôm prepared for downvotes, but I just thought I would share my thoughts on double pump. I know this will sound annoying, but if you hate that it gives your opponent an advantage over your single pump, or your pump tac, then learn it. 

It‚Äôs literally another thing that separates skilled players from unskilled players. Can an unskilled player double pump? No. But a skilled one can. Just like a skilled player can build.

I‚Äôm sick of this game being leveled out to cater to less skilled players. Pump delay, weapon delay as a whole, and things like port a forts literally close the skill gap and cater to these players.

476,Insayne-iwnl,1526940912,8l4s98,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l4s98/future_of_fortnite/,3,Future Of Fortnite,"I would like to reference this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l20ck/100000000_esport_announcement/?st=JHGSO3YX&amp;sh=bbebc025

I believe that this game has taken a step in the right direction and has made video games ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to a certain extent. There are people who are passionate gamers, who have played games for years, and now that fortnite got released they see their friends getting into it in either a competitive experience or just a casual one, and i believe that‚Äôs why fortnite has gained so much traction over the past year or so.

I myself have seen friends of 4 years, who have always taken the mickey out of me for playing video games, get extremely into this game, and want to play with me due to downright experience in video games. This is a huge bonus to fortnite and again another reason as to why i believe that the game took off.

Now here‚Äôs where the game gets interesting. The idea of RNG, in an esport, may seem crazy to some, heck, it even seems crazy to me. But, could it be a possibility? Back in 2017 we saw a H1Z1 Tournament with a lot of streamers that were big back then, sodapoppin, doc, etc etc. That game contained elements of RNG, that hadn‚Äôt really been seen before in a competitive scene. Now i know i shouldn‚Äôt talk about H1Z1 here, but i think it‚Äôs important in such a controversial topic as it‚Äôs something that has been done before. 

Here‚Äôs a short explanation for anyone unfamiliar with H1Z1, or H1 as i will call it. (Edit- i have 600 hours in this game, if anyone more experienced would like to add anything feel free :)).It is the same style as fortnite, except you had vehicles, and no building, shotguns, Assault Rifles, Pistols, you get the Jist. Now the ar‚Äôs were always reliable, no-one had a problem with them until different spray patterns were introduced (The game had spray patterns, or recoil patterns as they can be called, for each weapon that professionals would master to hit long range shots, also known as two-taps) Causing a lot of people to change their playstyles to be a lot less aggressive as up close rifles were not the best choice. (I know this is boring but stick with me, it all leads back i promise) This lead to shotguns becoming used a lot more, but consistency was an issue, as you could hit people in the head and not kill them, which was not intended. Again this lead back to RNG and i believe that this was one of the reasons that the game didn‚Äôt take off and that was all down to CONSITENCY.

How does this link to fortnite you ask? Well, we have shotguns. Most of the time the AR‚Äôs are reliable, most people wouldn‚Äôt dare play without one (Unless you‚Äôre ninja and you use an LMG). But it‚Äôs when you get up close with a blue pump and hit someone in the head for 20 damage when it‚Äôs meant to do 200+ that you start to see issues in tournaments.

The reliability of a shotgun, in an esport, in which the outcome can usually be predicted, is not at a high enough level that it wouldn‚Äôt be a major factor in professional games. I believe that unless consistency becomes next to perfect that the Pro Scene will NOT rise, and that the battle royale genre and the hype behind it will die out slowly, just like H1Z1 did.

Now i really don‚Äôt want to see this happen, so please epic, if you want to take this game further, make it happen. We want to see perfect hitboxes, no RNG with the shotguns, no building errors, no glitches and no bugs for a game that we want to see played at a professional level.

If anyone has anything to add drop me a PM. Thanks for reading.",FortNiteBR

My friends and I have played a lot of 50v50, and since we're all good players, this is the experience nearly every time with practically no close games. A lot of people are praising 50v50 for the quick, fast paced action, but 5x20 was better for this. Since the two teams have separate buses in 50v50, early game fights rarely happen because few want to put themselves at a severe disadvantage by trying to land on the opponent's side of the map. They will have landed and looted long before you can and your team likely will not accompany you if you try doing this. Unless you get a good circle where both teams have an equal chance of reaching a location near it, both teams will loot separately and uncontested. In 5x20, you could always get instant action right out of the bus because every team always had an equal chance of reaching a location, leading to huge fights where two teams decide to go to the same place. The fact that each team has roughly 80 potential opponents pushes the amount of actual action far past 50v50's (Daequan's 40 kill match where he was fighting all game, for example). Also, 5 equal teams means your average chances of winning are 1/5 rather than 1/2, meaning snowballs occur far less often.

I know that 50v50 is blowing up in popularity and has been constantly appearing as the weekly LTM, but I don't see how 5x20 wasn't just a similar but superior mode.",FortNiteBR

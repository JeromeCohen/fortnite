Nowadays with no swearing and no competitive feeling in his stream i stooped watching.its not that i hate ninja but i don't watch his stream nowadays.And even today's stream was kinda cringy after i watched for 10 min.i stopped watching the stream.i will surely start watching him again if he goes back to old ninja.He says i am the old ninja but with no swearing but i think you need to see why you are slowing losing viewers and other things.I am not attacking ninja or anything just putting my opinion so ninja can see.i just miss old ninja that's why i am posting this,FortNiteBR

1. It's fun to use
2. It's fun to play against

A lot of things in this game are not fun to play against.

It's not fun to be rammed into by a plane. It's not fun to have boom boxes thrown at you. It's not fun to get bodied for 150 damage by a heavy sniper. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand what EPIC has against putting stuff into an LTM for a week to test it. Not only would this be good for players who want to play competitively because newer/more casual players will more likely play the LTM, but it would also be good for the lower level players to have somewhere to play where not everyone can build the Taj Mahal.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only should these items be tested for balancing reasons, but for bugs too. There are numerous issues with the plane right now, and while understandably EPIC is on break, these issues with the plane have been around for 3 weeks. What would be so bad to halt some additions to the game to have players test them so that the rest of the game maintains a healthy state. There's a reason everyone's been experiencing worse performance lately.",FortNiteBR

60,Responsible_Honeydew,1546314859,abeosy,112,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/abeosy/the_switch_needs_a_serious_update_now/,1,The Switch needs a serious update. Now.,"First of all, I’d like to say that I know someone made a post on this recently, but I’d like to reinforce it because I truly believe this needs to be brought to attention.

Fortnite on the Switch is easily the least maintained platform of Fortnite (yes, even less than Mobile at the moment), and as a player that started on Switch in season 5, I’ve had plenty of time to get familiar with Switch Fortnite and what needs to change.

First of all. The frame rate. Frame rate on Switch is hot garbage compared to other consoles, especially in large team modes. 

Secondly. In some matches, bright lights will violently flash all over the screen (usually during gliding), and not only hurt my head but could be very dangerous to people with epilepsy. 

Third. We don’t get our own servers. Now I understand this may not be possible for several reasons (for example, the switch playerbase is considerably small) but it’s not fair that we get pitted against xbox and ps4 players that not only have much better frame rate but also likely much more experience considering that fortnite on those platforms has been available for much longer than fortnite on switch.

Fourth. This isn’t technically a problem with the game, but a very helpful feature. We don’t have stats. It’s very annoying to have to take a screenshot of all of my wins, which fills up my memory quickly. I understand we can’t have replay due to performance issues, but at least give us stats. (Yes, I know they are working on this but it’s been three seasons now.) 

There are many other issues with the switch that I don’t know enough about to complain about, but please, epic. Make the game more enjoyable for Switch owners that just want to play Fortnite.

Slot 5- Sniper/Explosives or medkit/bandages if carrying any 

I think this is by far the quickest and most effective order I’ve e found. AR initially (slot1) , allows to quickly switch to shotgun (slot 2) or sniper/explosives (slot 5) with 1 tap.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate planes? The obvious answer: you played this game in it's prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 12 or 13 years old. That means you only got into fortnite the last couple of months. So you never played fortnite in it's prime.

And because you didn't play the game in it's prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into other people's build fights with a plane. But here's the thing: fortnite isn't played in planes.

The moment season 7 got released i really enjoyed playing with the planes cause it was something new.

sadly now people noticed how op planes are and will only be flying around looking for people wich is mostly an ongoing fight the 3rd parties are really annoying when it comes to a plane.

litterally all they do is fly inside the build and atleast 1 of the 2 already fighting will take a huge hit in hp

i'd say the 3rd partying is worse then with the glider redeployment

since they could actually take down your entire build with 1 boost

there are so many ways to help this problem.

for example lower plane spawns right now im pretty sure the most common vechile in the game is a plane.

nerfing the gun, the gun has no bloom at all if u line up your crosshair you can laser a person from full to 0 in like 1 second

lower the hp pool of planes

shooting 800 hp and everyone knowing where u are including the plane just to try and get rid of it while they could simply jump out before the plane explodes making sure they dont get the 50 explosion damage.

i know im not the only one who hates planes in their current state.

High ground doesn't even matter now. If you get natural high ground they're just going to rift up or use a plane. If you outbuild someone they'll just grapple up or blow your builds up with dynamite.

When we knock down one player we won’t finish them, we try to kill their teammate first. Im surprised at how many groups don’t do this. 
It sucks when one of us gets killed and the other makes it out alive, so we always give the opportunity of revival to other teams. 

The only times we will shoot at a downed player:
1. If we are in a fight and need a gun/ammo.
2. If there are less than 5 opponents remaining.

I use dynamite and grenades a lot to destroy structures so I can get to players easier, it’s how I play the game and how I get wins. I know building is a prominent feature in the game, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be counterable.

The new boom box is fucking amazing for stopping annoying build spams. It is a little powerful, and some changes are definitely needed, but people need to understand there’s multiple ways to playing Fortnite. Spam building or camping in builds isn’t the only one. Get over it. ",FortNiteBR

We need some change, please.","The game is in what I, and many other people would consider to be the worst state it's ever been in. Over the past month EPIC has almost completely ignored our begging for balance and change in Fortnite. It's becoming more frustrating to play and many people aren't enjoying the game as much as they used to. I think we can form a collective opinion on what needs to change in the game to make it fun, but at the same time very balanced.

 **Necessary Changes**

-  **Planes:** They still crash through builds and can kill you just by ramming into you. There's no counter to it in many situations, you just end up dead.

**Proposed Change:** Planes can no longer ram through structures. The boost feature is now quicker to make up for it.

-  **Dynamite:** It can still stack to 10 and can be found more commonly than ARs. You can just throw a stack on a 1 x 1 and they're almost guaranteed to be dead.

**Proposed Change:** Changed stack size to 6. Decreased drop chance.

-  **Boombox:** Changed stack size to 3. Decreased drop chance. Active for 10 seconds instead of 15. Radius decreased by 1 tile.

-  **Explosives:** You can still spam with them and it blows my mind. I can't tell you how many countless times my friends and I have been spammed by them without a single counter. They make squads nearly impossible to play because the teammates can constantly refill the 'splode carriers' with more rockets.

**Proposed Change:** Blast radius added, damage will decrease the further the target is from the explosion, down to 25% of the damage. Quad Launcher fire rate decreased by .5 seconds or Vaulted.

I think this would be very beneficial to allow more people to get their dream combos. Although less people would be buying both skins in a set to get a good combo, I believe many more people would buy a single skin from a set so they could also get a back bling of their choice. This may seem like a stretch, but I think this could be a very good idea!

EXPLOSIVES- Issue is you can instantly place more walls or simply turbo build.

STINK BOMBS. - Issue is you can just move out of the tiny area and build more.


Belive it or not, it would be unbalanced if building didnt have a counter. I agree that the boombox should be tomed down, but you cant say a building counter item alone ruins comp.

The amount of times Ive died because it's the only short range weapon I can found and It does very little damage is just too much to count.

It does very very little damage per shot like 30 and if you're lucky it does more and the bullet spread just makes it worse. It's just terrible. If I can't find a pump or a heavy and the only shotgun I could find is a tac I consider myself dead because it's eventually going to make me die cause it does no damage and the other player has an actual good shotgun and they easily beat me.

Now Im not asking for it to be vaulted but it definitely deserves a little buff since it's just bad.

After watching this, quite honestly my stomach turned as I gagged in frusturation. These streamers think they are so smart, labeling their views as always right. Truth is, Fortnite is the reason their career is where it’s at.


To me it’s a “Pay respect to your elders” sort of thing, and these people who have been blessed by Fortnite treat Epic like shit. It really is a good thing that I am not a game dev, because I don’t have the tolerance to put up with these know-it-all streamers calling me a “little kid who throws *shit*?” Fuck that.


PS: This is not a cricle jerk for Epic. I hope this thread can be that of an appreciation for all they have accomplished. For what it’s worth, I actually enjoy the Boombox. Thanks for reading through my rant.

Putting an item in where they think it would be balanced could go one of two ways, it could be just about right and with very minimal changes, which would be good, but rare, or it would be underpowered and then no one would bother picking up said item because they feel it isn't worth it, giving Epic no data on how to balance it, and then they are left doing buffs that they don't know will work or not, which could lead to more time trying to fix the item if those balances don't work and so on, it is a slippery slope..

When it comes to releasing something overpowered, Epic will know through player feedback a lot easier what exactly needs to be worked on, because people are more likely to use said items in a match, and they can get accurate information on how to tune them down to put them more in line with everything else. This has happened several times now in the games life span, the mini-gun, the compact, turret's, planes, etc.. You name any item that the community had a cow about when it was launched and you will see that most of the time, once epic had the chance to nerf said item to make it more balanced, the anger and rage about said item being overpowered died down.. (Aside from the sword..) 

Perfect example are probably the two most recent items to have this issue, the turrets and planes. When they were released there were posts all day about how they were over powered, and they were going to ruin the game, ""This is where epic killed their game, uninstalling"" posts galore.. Now look at these two items, they have been worked on and have been made to be pretty balanced at this point. Turrets can usually be countered by a good sniper or just by building a little more because of the overheating being so quick now, and planes, they take so much damage now you can usually blow it up and get a clean 50 damage off on all the people in the plane. 

Epic is not the only company to do this, a lot of games where there are constant characters/items being added do as well. My main example, is moba's, specifically Smite. Anytime a god was released underpowered, no one would play them, and they usually sat being pretty terrible for some time, only having changes made after who knows how long because they didn't know exactly what to buff (looking at you ravana and cabraken.) Now compare that to anytime a new god was released and they were considered overpowered, you would typically see changes to that character in no time at all to bring them more in line with everyone else, and its because player feedback and playtime was a lot higher then the gods who were underpowered..

Yes there is an argument to be made for both sides on Epic needing to put these changes into a test server. I am personally of the opinion that while everyone cry's for test server's, it isnt because they themselves want to help test out new items, it is just because they don't want to deal with the new items in their normal modes. Honestly in my personal experiences, most test servers for games don't end up being useful because for the average player, they aren't going to bother actually testing anything out, or they are just using it to see the newest content earlier. Be honest with yourself here and think, would you actually play on the test servers and encourage others to do so as well? Honestly, i don't see the majority of people doing that, so then it falls back into the problem of epic not getting enough data or playtime with the item to really understand how to balance the item before releasing it to the live game, so instead of wasting time setting up testing servers, they just put it in the game over powered and fix it accordingly.

You may not like having to deal with overpowered weapons or items, but honestly, this community needs to chill out with all the outrage and hating they do on Epic, because at the end of the day, they are doing what they need too to make sure new items are actually useful and not another six shooter. I have a pretty good feeling how this post is going to go before even posting it, so we will see if i am right. Let me know what you think down in the comments. ",FortNiteBR

The opponents are fixated with eliminating someone once they set their sights on them. I've had people chase me across the island, into the storm, in planes, just about any way you can imagine, just to kill me after I take a shot at them. Sometimes (often) it causes them to get eliminated, because their fixation prevents them from seeing other players shooting at them.

I did some research and found this:

Both of these bugs have been in the game since the beginning of season 7, and have not been changed. I think that Epic feels that due to a certain game mode (Creative) that has been introduced lately, that there is no need for Playgrounds, and in some aspects this is true, but playgrounds is important to the game, and brings a lot to the table. I hope that Playgrounds gets more attention, from Epic so that they can fix issues with it, and from the community, so that they can point out these issues.",FortNiteBR

But, could they technically rerelease an entire battlepass and get around this? Epic Games is a company that wants to make money more than they care about what’s considered a rare cosmetic item, so I have no doubt they would return in some shape or form. This is really just a question of mine, I don’t need to be told 100 times that I should have spent more money on a free game a year ago that I had only really played a few times. ",FortNiteBR

First off, to anyone willing to use the ""Yeah but Mobile isn't as important as PC or Consoles"" (I've seen it a couple times in a discord server where I discussed mobile issues) argument: Yes, you are right, you'll very rarely see a mobile player play nearly as well or be nearly as relevant as a PC player, but guess what, mobile is for many including my casual friends and my siblings, the first platform one would want to play fortnite on. If the mobile version sucks, which it does, the game wouldn't have the same impact on new players than if it hadn't sucked. For the sake of the game, please address the issues I'm about to talk about.

**Movement ""Joystick"" maneuverability sucks**: Change it. Or at least give us an option to disable the fact that moving my thumb down a little just after I dragged it upwards interrupts my movement. This makes it extremely uncomfortable and forces a player to lift their thumb. Also make auto-run appear whenever you're dragging the joystick up or just make it a button.

**Aiming sucks**: This one is incredible. Most PC players would know what ""mouse acceleration"" is, but I'll explain it here: Mouse Acceleration is a thing that makes it so that the faster you move your mouse (in this case, finger), then the higher your sensitivity. This is garbage and NO video game player benefits from it. 

**Button/widget responsiveness is a monstrosity**: I often need to tap a button twice or three times in order for it to perform it's task.

**Honestly, where is 60 FPS?**: Playing at 30 FPS on the phone is actually fine, but releasing fortnite for Android and later patch the only way to get to 60 FPS (which involved changing some text in the game files in a file manager), when even my phone was able to get consistent 50-60 FPS with no justification whatsoever wasn't exactly the best thing to do in my opinion.

Now, the rest of the game is fine. Lobby looks great, item shop does what it's intended to do just fine, creative meh but I consider it as a bonus and the graphic quality is honestly pretty good though it tends to be a little dark. 

Feel free to give your thoughts down below and sorry for the angry looking text (I wrote it all at once and didn't go back to check for spelling and grammatical structure so pls pardon me).

Happy New year btw",FortNiteBR

A very small number of players know that the exact final location of the storm circle is indicated as soon as the bus starts moving. If you find a Bush, grab a shotgun, bandages, and a slurp, and prop up on or near the final location. I have won games many different ways. Ive set up bait towers and prked myself outside near the bottom, ive stayed a bit out of the way with a slurp active, a campfire, and used bandages, and ive stayed on the spot and waited for the last player to get close, only to end his game with a single shotgun blast. Regardless of the chosen method, having a bush is nearly a guaranteed win. Im going to be sad once Steady Storm is gone because i really enjoyed winning game after game in hilarious ways",FortNiteBR

I want to have a proper discussion about the boom box, and why I don't think that it's as OP as people are saying. First, let's actually see how the boom box is used. It can be used mainly for 2 cases.

1st case: You will fight an enemy and you want to prevent him from building, so you throw the box and you will be able to kill him without the worry of him building a 10-story fort. 

2nd case: you see a huge fort or structure so you throw the box and knock the structure down.

Here is why it isn't OP:

In the first case, people claim that 26 seconds is too long and without the ability to build you will die instantly. 
This takes no more than 10 IQ to counter. All you have to do is walk outside the radius(which is about 3 tiles) and boom, start building. People are saying that having to walk 3 tiles without building is impossible. It isn't at all for one reason- boogie bombs. And what do boogie bombs do? They prevent you from building AND shooting. Boom box stops you from building only and you can easily walk outside the radius in 4 seconds. Boogie bombs prevent you from building and shooting, and their affect lasts longer than the time it takes to run 3 tiles+ they can be thrown out to further distances than the boom box. This easily makes them worse to deal with than boom boxes. They were added in season 2 and until now I haven't seen a single person complaining about them being OP. They have no counters unless your enemy has bad aim or bloom. But when they add an item that is a worse version of boogie bombs and actually has counters, it is OP. That makes no sense at all.

In the second case people are saying that boom boxes knocking down structures is OP. First, when you throw the box it takes time to activate, and then takes even more time to destroy the structure(depending on which material is being used), and it doesn't deal damage to players. Let's look at another item- grenades. Grenades, or dynamite drop in stacks of 3. If you throw 3 grenades at a structure, the first grenade will destroy part of it, the second one will completely destroy it and the third one will deal 100 damage to the player. And dynamit is even worse as it has a larger radius and deals more damage to structures. Boom boxes take time to activate and time to destroy the structure. They can't even deal damage to players. Some people will say ""iT tAkEs SkILL tO tHrOw gReNAdEs"" which is just dumb. Any one who has eyes will not miss a grenade throw to a huge structure. Are grenades OP? Then why do you claim that boom boxes are if grenades and dynamite are technically worse. It would be easier to deal with a box the just damages structures than 3 grenades that deal alot of damage and can actually kill you. And I haven't even mentioned the grenade and rocket launchers. As I said, no need to hate I just want to have a discussion on the new boom box.

I wasn’t that great at it but loved it nonetheless. I’ve been getting more into the specifics of gaming beyond just different tips and tricks to get better.

Fortnite has been the only game in my life that I’ve had the issue of latency between controller and action on screen be such a hinderance. Countless times I know I’ve pulled the trigger only to have zero shot go down range or immediately followed by my pulling the trigger my opponents weapon fires and now I’ve been chunked for solid damage.

When looking into pc builds what continued to come up over and over again was this talk of a 1ms latency and I found out that most TVs pack a whopping 30ms on average especially for larger TVs. So sadly bigger isn’t better here.

Has anyone else on here made the switch to a monitor for gaming? If so have you noticed a significant enough of a difference to justify purchasing one? I’m a casual player, but still enjoy a win every now and then.

Honestly, only having won 4 games of battle royale ever is just really aggravating when you always have to go against players that are really good at the game, especially those that are too good at the game for you to even beat in a gunfight. Why we need matchmaking that closes the skill gap between players is because, you know how Fortnite is rapidly gaining lots of players, right? Well, most of those players as soon as they start playing are most likely, not going to be good at the game. Let me put what type of matchmaking we need; lets say someone has 12 wins and 324 eliminations in his entire tenure of playing fortnite, if this type of matchmaking takes place, that player with 12 wins and 324 eliminations would be going against players with the same amount of wins and eliminations or somewhere similar to the same amount. I want this to be in the game because I don't want to constantly die to people that play the game competitively and just play to beat people at the game instead of dying to people that just play the game casually like I do.",FortNiteBR

The boombox that was added isn't as overpowered as you think it is. It may be annoying to come against, but isn't overpowered in any major way. it only destroys buildings within a 3 block radius, and only lasts a short period of time. Additionally, the item has only been out for a short while, not too many great ways of countering it have been found, but from the patch notes' description of the item, one bullet will shut the boombox up, and allow you to build, so it should be a huge problem, so long as you can see it. I've seen so many complaints, and so few posts saying that it's actually good, and isn't OP. Just because something breaks buildings doesn't mean that its ""game breaking"" or ""overpowered"" Furthermore, you shouldn't need to rely on building so heavily that you cant live without it. That's just some of my thoughts, and i wish to hear what you guys think about this, and please provide some type of argument and not just ""it ruined my build battle""

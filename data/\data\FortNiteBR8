It rewarded players for getting a kill, and with it in all game modes for a temporary time, it actually brought back many players to the scene of this game, which gave you the perfect idea to remove it! Thanks Epic Games! For 'Listening' to the community by removing the thing that actually made the game fun! That was about two seasons ago, in that time what's gotten better or worse? Well one of the biggest things is the island, generally it's gotten better, biggest of all was the vault, which lead to the re-addition to the Drum Gun, this of course came with it's nerfs, and alot of people were sceptical about it, many claim that it was rigged, but as far as the rumors go I'm not one to believe in such conspiracies, the BIGGEST removal was definitely the Pump, this leading into the replacement being the new Combat Shotgun, otherwise know as the dubbed Sniper Shotgun or the Loot that won't spawn because Shotgun spawn rates are pretty bad, not sure about that new patch either, there's also a new Grenade Launcher but so far it's been pretty solid. There's also a problem I need to get off my chest, tge current state of the metas and Team Rumble. 
Team Rumble, 
The environment that many use for training accuracy, quest objective completion, and more notably: jumping players 5v1
Team Rumble is by far the most toxic environment in Fortnite more so than the Arena Players, over the past few seasons it's only gotten worse and has become so toxic it's unbelievable. A typical game of team rumble consists of herds of players on your team jacking kills from you and getting killed by herds if enemies who focus their energies to attack solos, there's also the inconvenience of having to grab the ammunitions and materials off of the person you just eliminated when your teammates take it or you're getting shot in the back, it would be simple to just make it react like a siphon, there's also the demand for materials that generally blow out quickly and you barely get enough for eliminating an enemy after possibly spending way more just to get the elimination, the only solution is to either just get rid of this game mode and force the players back into solos, duos and squads or make stability changes and punish players accordingly.
The New Meta, 
Smgs are pretty much dead, the Burst SMG doesn't pay tribute to this by ever excelling as there is no variation past blue that may offer something sweet, and the closest we may have is the Drum Gun, but good luck finding it useful when all you ever need to win the game is overwhelming Combat Shotgun that pretty much killed the SMG meta as a whole, The Combat Shotgun is effective close range and medium range, in many cases of being eliminated by one you may find that the user was likely low ground beaming your head, the ultimate weapon for noobs and console players, taking elements fron the pump such as the recticle, with rounds easy to chuck and a fast fire rate, and of course tje overall capabilities of it make it an overwhelming weapon that jusy about any person can use, is it balanced? No$ But it's everything the community had been complaining for in a shotgun, solid damage, consistent, easy to use, but where does this leave us? Well it often feels terrible constantly being eliminated by it due to it's insane reach, whereas the Tactical Shotgun is doing worst not only at reach but every one of these factors, the Tac is inconsistent up close, does all full 75 damage RIGHT UP ON AN ENEMY, you have to guarantee yourself a headshot if you ever wanted to get effective eliminations but even then they don't always hit for the right amount of damage, in the long run there definitely needs to be some rebalancing on the Combat Shotgun, and a Buff on certain aspects of the Tactical Shotgun. Just to name a few issues.
Has it improved overall? Certainly! But in some ways it didn't, this is just my perspective.",FortNiteBR

Please note that I have *no* issues with my internet. I can download at 10 mbps on IDM. And other downloads.

This has been happening to many of my friends, and maybe to you guys too.

I don't think having HDD means ZERO download speed too. 500 kpbs STEADY would also be fine.

Hence, a mere 300 MB update takes more than half a day (Kept my pc on all night last update btw.)

Maybe to Epicgames, if they come across this post: Apex downloads at 10 Mbps constant. So how can *they* do this while this launcher has a mini-steam, that no one buys from get 0 download speed on average?

Team Rumble is now more competitive than the Arena.","What kind of reality is this EPIC? How can the most casual mode (team death match) have the most competitive ruleset in this game?   

Just look at all these beautiful rules the comp scene can only dream of and is begging for:

- 100% chest spawns (Less RNG)

- No grey weapons (Less RNG)

- Increased AR and Shotgun spawn rates (Less RNG)

- Increased Shield spawn rates (Less RNG)

- Increased harvesting rates (Considered competitive &amp; Unhealthy aggression)

- Mats and ammo on kill (Considered competitive &amp; Unhealthy aggression)

- No Boom Bow (Separate loot pool that fits the vastly different gameplay from pubs)

Why on earth is the competitive mode not balanced separately to the pub mode when it already has siphon and increased mats? Pubs are not a practice ground for Arena as the ""zero hype"" Arena is noob friendlier than pubs because of SBMM, so there goes that argument. [How exactly is something like this](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bzpv5n/proximity_gl_is_crazy_broken_late_game/) even remotely considered balanced in a so called ""competitive"" environment?

Nobody and I mean nobody liked it. So who likes the weapon like that? By what epic said, 90% of playerbase likes casual gameplay and op weapons. The problem is, if casual players dont care at all (at the point where they dont know how to hold w and sprint) why ruin competitive players that grind 24/7 to be the best?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna assume that probably the majority of people in this sub Reddit didn't join in s1, maybe some did but most probably their was much less posts as the game was just starting out, most probably that's the case unless i'm mistaken. Now I learned trough experience in my life that people around you have a huge impact on you, people spread different energy and vibes which most people consume naturally and it has a huge impact on their mood and things/life. I found that when I just stay off Reddit and Twitter, I found myself having more fun playing this game because things aren't as bad as they may seem, yes the majority of what people complain about are true and they should 100 percent complain about them but reading so many negative posts everyday on here and especially on the comp sub Reddit, brings a lot of negative energy to your mood and when you play you stay so focused on those things people complain about and it's horrible, say a lot of people complain about not finding a shield or a shotgun, you'll play waiting with frustration to get one as quick as possible with anger, a lot of things people complain about are necessary to complain about but you'll find that people spread their feedback in the most immature, angry and bad vibed way possible, a lot of people don't even bother to mention the positive things about the game, yes there's a lot of negative but it's just as bad to mention only the positive and not mention the negative as it's bad to mention only the negative and not the positive. You have to be grateful for some things you can't just complain about everything and not be grateful for when we actually get a good change. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways what i'm trying to say is, stop consuming people's energy, if there's a bad update, sure complain about it but don't stay on Reddit reading everybody's rant posts as I found personally that it puts me in a bad, very stressed mood and I hate it. And if you're going to complain and give constructive feedback, please be mature about it, saying ""THIS GAME IS FUCKING TRASH BRO"" isn't going to help Epic fix the problems with the game, say what the problem is and in a mature way, say ""hey, the boom bow does too much splash damage, to make it balance it would help if it got vaulted or nerfed by doing x and that etc... "" not saying don't use Reddit or Twitter or whatever but everything is bad when overdone so just stay healthy, gotta have some good nice vibes, can't let this shit effect your mood too much and if you say it doesn't when you probably rage, it's ovb man, we're human.

I remember Summer 2018, i would wake up, watch whats in the item shop and start fortnite immediatly to grind with my friends. Now, all my friends quit, and im like the only one left. Epic is adding too much things we will never use, the meta is garbage, and the map is really bad. Simplicity was key in this game. Look at what they are adding now, Storm flip? ... Slipstreams? Literally, why. Whenever i play fortnite now it feels really weird. It doesnt feel like fortnite. I really wish we could get back to the prime days. I hope they do something special for season 10. we all love this game. but Epic is just not listening to their community. Maybe, instead of having 1 map, add complete different maps that we could choose to play. A Season 3 map with all the season 3 weapons in it. Im just feeling so nostalgic lately.",FortNiteBR

It seems like a lot of people are crying over how much damage it does and then proceed to rant about how bows take no skill etc and so forth.

Wrong.

I get killed by a Boom Bow or any sniper for that matter like 3 times a season while I get killed by a single shotgun blast almost every goddamn game that I don’t win.

It’s the same argument from lazy, sweaty players who focus on build first, shotgun second. A bow shot SHOULD be devastating and you should be rewarded for making long range shots. People need to be at risk when out in the open or high up. The Boom Bow keeps people honest and punish other players if you’re accurate.
It’s absolutely asinine that the same group of players who think one-pumping or the combat shotgun makes ANY sense yet lose their marbles when someone pops them for not playing tactically or being aware enough.

This was back in season 3 when the game was at its absolute peak in terms of popularity in both gaming and mainstream. It was kind of a rough start for me as my friend slowly but surely showed me the ropes to the game, by then, I began to get hooked over it. We would both play almost every day and laughing out asses off as we panic every time we heard a noise outside of our hiding spots. 

Come season 4 when I found out that my cousin whom I’ve never really spoken to all that much also played Fortnite, we suddenly began talking about it and it suddenly helped us connect as we began playing together and have fun. Things got even more fun for me when Playground was first introduced, I would have dozens of hours just spent having fun with my cousin and her friend just playing hide and seek on the map and just screwing around.

However, come season 9 and it’s only then I suddenly feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness when I realize I’m the only left in my circle to still play the game. The friend that got me into the game has gotten bored from the Fortnite craze and has moved on to Apex or other games, my cousin is in university and the overwhelming work there has kept her from playing less and less over time, almost non existent at this point. 

I never really appreciated the time spent with those I know until now when they’re no longer sticking around. Fortnite was honestly the first online game I had ever socialised this much with my friends and family, it bought me so much genuine happiness spending so much time with others. But now that the people that brought me said joy have left the game due to boredom or real life responsibilities, it kinda makes me feel sad.",FortNiteBR

I am a mediocre casual player but I love the game. I love building and I love the mechanics of Fortnite. All of that is being ruined only to create a giant spam fest meta. Every player I run into is a god and every weapon completely deletes my health in an instant. This meta is not helping a player like me it is actually making the game unplayable. I hope Epic sees this and realizes they are ruining the game we all fell in love with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The classic mode was the most fun I have had playing Fortnite since the early days. The guns and load-outs were simple. Most players had a regular AR, regular shotgun,  a TAC SMG, and a BOLT. The only mobility were launchpads. Fights were long and strategic because guns did less damage, and there were not 7 different ways to the team could instantly launch on you. Players needed good aim with their AR or sniper to hit you from far, or they needed to strategically build to you, to get close enough to use their shotgun. Now, as soon as I see players I get absolutely lasered by the toxic weapons in the game and then the launch on me and spam me with drums, combats, tac AR's, etc. This new META does not cater to casuals everyone I run into is a complete sweat, with every spam gun in the game. It's complete trash. Whenever I do make it to the late game the last team has 10+ kills every time, and all the most toxic guns in the game. Every time I try to build I get spammed down and can't do anything. It's just not fun anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, me and buddies are all casual players, and we all agree this is the least fun we have ever had playing the game. We preferred the game when the guns were simpler, did less damage, required aim, and were less spammy. We also preferred when the game had less mobility so players didn't immediately launch on you and there was less third partying. I am getting closer and closer to quitting Fortnite for good after spending the last year and a half grinding this game and it is very disappointing.",FortNiteBR

I gladly accepted as he has some sweet og skins. I unlinked my current account from my Xbox gamertag and linked his account to my gamertag. Now I don’t see any of his skins... his account appears to be completely wiped.

I re-linked my original account and all of my skins were still there... whew.

Just for a sanity check, I signed in to his account on mobile and it’s still wiped! Are his skins gone forever???

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!!",FortNiteBR

A worse game? That's arguable, and I would say FortNite is better than ever. But god is it hard to be a fan of this game. It's hard to enjoy it when everyone is throwing it to the curb as some game with toxic children. People don't see it as an average game that people who AREN'T kids enjoy. I find it hard to be in communities when almost everyone is shitting on fortnite, and it just gets so tiring. 

I find that I don't defend it as a game anymore because everyone circlejerks to the same ""fortnite bad"" without playing it, or even looking into it. But when people say this, it just becomes even more monotonous. ""The game is fine, but the community is toxic/ all it is is toxic kids."" There's a sizeable audience of people who aren't kids who play. All the people see is the clips of mic spamming kids in squad games on youtube and think it's all that. Most people don't even USE mics, or even mic spam. There's a layer of surface garbage that people uphold as the game.

Also, there are people who play it for a good hour and act like all there is to the game is hiding in bushes and sometimes you win. There's depth to the game, very much so. It takes time to get into, time to get good. It took months for me to even get to my skill level, which may I remind you is, mediocre. It takes time, it takes investment. 

But after all of this, I just find it hard to enjoy the game with this in mind. Fortnite hate is in it's peak right now, and every person who think they're different from everyone else comments on fortnite as ""not my cup of tea."" I find it hard to debate. I just get overwhelmed with downvotes, etc. So, if any of you want my account, I'll give it. PM me. I'm done.",FortNiteBR

A few reviews even mention how the CEO lost control as epic exploded(presumably from fortnite). Considering how Epic treats its OWN people, is it really surprising how they treat this community? They haven't even paid some of the pros for their tournament earnings! I've worked in places where upper-middle management created a literal hell-scape and this sounds very familiar. I wouldn't expect many changes until Epic resolves how it runs internally.

Fortnite comes onto the scene and I fall in love with it. I play Fortnite with a controller (XB1 Elite) on PC. My problem is most of the time when I’m aiming (in distance) I tend to over aim my target. I feel like I’m not even applying heavy pressure to the thumb-stick, but my reticle warps across the screen. The thumb-sticks for Xbox controllers are extremely light to me. I read on a bunch of websites that the thumb-stick tensions are around 60grams so after doing more searching I came across this website called ‘Evil Controllers’ where they make custom controllers and they have a option to increase the thumb-stick to 200grams so I purchased it. My controller should be arriving sometime this week, but do you guys think 200grams might be a bit overkill for a thumb-stick?

They take up too much of the lootpool, and if you’re in early game with no tac shotty or drum gun you’re fucked. I get the rng aspect, but there’s too much of a divide between how powerful these same-rarity items are. I shit you not, I went 3 games in a row without landing on even a grey tac shotgun, and everyone else had one but me.

Bottom line is: I’m tired of all these filler items early-game that basically guarantee death. I remember when you could use literally anything from a chest and have a chance of winning over someone with a gold scar, but now it feels like some weapons are a death sentence. Idk why they vaulted the hunting rifle to add back the semi-auto sniper, and I’m really confused as to why they thought a burst smg was a good idea after the removal of the burst rifle (which the majority of people were happy about - and for good reasons). 

Epic should either make common and uncommon tac shotguns more common, or just remove the common and uncommon rarities and keep the rare one - because it wouldn’t make a difference in the slightest with how fucked their current spawn rate is.",FortNiteBR

This may just be a dumb thought but hear me out!

The Main Thing we know about the Polar Peak Monster is the giant Eye. 

The Fortbyte Picture also shows us this eye.

And here is the thing:

The Graveyard in Haunted Hill has an eye on some of its tombstones.

Haunted Hills was added in Season 2 so basically right before the Story started.

This leads me to think that the Polar Peak Monster will happen to do something with Haunted Hills.

(This and the very obvious thing that each corner of the map got changed except for Haunted, Junk and Pleasant)

Also: It is said that the dead people from pleasant park are being burried in Haunted Hills and sometimes their spirits go over to pleasant to ""continue to ""live"" their lives as they used to"". (This is based on a rumor that some doors in pleasent open or close by themself every now and then)

I did read somewhere that the original game was supposed to be an horror game. (I am not sure how true this actually is)

But if its true, it actually makes sense why haunted and pleasant are still there and probably gonna be the last one to be changed.

&amp;#x200B;

(I do read quite a lot into small things, for example i tried to predict a pet chicken back when the animal back blings came out cause some shadow near the first weeks BP star looked like a chicken being barked at by a dog.... So yeh, pls dont hate too much on me. I mean, there was a chicken skin released very soon after that and the shadow dissappeared after the skin was released + the polar peak monster does have the footprints of a chicken or something so i wasnt that wrong i guess)",FortNiteBR

The tac shotgun is the only shotgun you find, unless you get a decent landing in which case there'll be thirty of them. Useless. The tac shotgun is so vastly inferior to the combat shotgun it isn't even funny.

What difference is 2 or 4 damage when you can't do that consistent damage from 1 or more tiles away? There's not enough AR's anymore. The supressed scar was fine. Vault the heavy AR instead. That would be fine. The bow basically makes RPG's redundant. I don't even need to talk about the bugs.

Fortnites answer? Add another Grenade launcher. Fantastic. Just what I wanted. Another grenade launcher. It's just so frustrating seeing the game go in the direction it is. This has been the worst season whereas the previous was the best in my opinion (meta wise). I do love the slipstreams, I love the geysers, and I love the airdocks.

End game is beyond stale.,"So it's painfully obvious the glider Redeploy has 7 too many charges.  It needs to be nerfed down to 3 max charges or vaulted altogether.

There's way too much third partying.
There's no risk reward for building anymore.
It creates sameness in all end game fights.

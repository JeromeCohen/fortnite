But aside from that, they’re honestly all pretty terrible compared to last season’s. Breakdown for tier 95 is a thousand miles behind last season’s Groove Jam at tier 95. Honestly, even Swipe It sucks, but just stands out because of how bad the rest of the battle pass’s emotes have been. Calculated? What the hell is that one? Dude taps his head twice and 2+2=4 appears above his head. What? 

Skins have been pretty good for the pass but the emotes were seriously awful, and I know it’s late in the season to be mentioning this but I figured now is better than never so that hopefully next season’s are somewhat better. The emotes are probably my favorite part of the battle pass, and looking over all the ones that were handed out this season, I’m genuinely disappointed. Unless you count the golf balls/ basketballs/ beach balls, which I don’t. 

Maybe I’m in the minority, but I shouldn’t be. There’s not a single one from this battle pass I have in my locker emotes. That’s not good. ",FortNiteBR

So easy it's boring. Winning a getaway match is in no way comparable to winning a squads match. I'd argue that it's even easier to win a Getaway match than it is to finish top 4 in Squads since you don't have to last till the end. So why does a Getaway win count towards your stats?

Now personally I don't care about my own stats profile. I haven't looked at it in months, I couldn't even tell you how many wins I have. So it's not a huge deal to me personally, but I know a lot of people are out there that do take stats serious. And isn't it pretty cheesy that someone with 4 wins could probably go into getaway and get dozens in a week? lol. It just de-values the stats. It's gonna make it to where you have to take people's squad wins with a grain of salt. 

So yeah Epic you guys should honestly just make it way harder to win. The mode would be so much more fun. Me and my friends played a handful of matches and were already bored with it and went back to regular Squads. The mode has potential, don't get me wrong.

I want to start this off by saying, I think Fortnite Battle Royale is in the best spot it’s been in since it’s release. Even though you receive so many complaints and suggestions daily, you all should know there are plenty of us out there who really appreciate everything you’ve done to make this game what it is today. All of the weapons and utilities you’ve added and changed around, the creative limited time game modes as well as all the really cool map updates (I love the changes you’ve made to dusty divot recently). This game exceeds my expectations with (nearly) every update. I love finding new things and locations each week and the suspense leading up to the season finales is so intense and mysterious. People have come up with some awesome theory’s on what to expect. I don’t think the balance with weapons has ever been in a better spot. I find myself constantly torn when it comes to how I want to fill my five inventory slots. “Do I pick up that blue hunting rifle when I’ve already got a purple burst or use that slot for something close range? Do I follow up my pump shotty with a blue drum gun or a gold compact SMG? Do I want to fill a spot with some blue splodes or should I hold onto this grappler? Would I rather carry ten minis or three big shields?” The combinations of load outs are changing my play style with every match. Also you’ve done an UNBELIEVABLE job trying to cater to everyone’s wants as needs and really listening to the players opinion on what changes should and shouldn’t be made. Not many developers do that and it doesn’t go unnoticed. Even with some of the incredible games that have come out recently I still find myself coming back to play FNBR. I haven’t even begun to get bored with this game. 

So EPIC. Keep doing what you’re doing and know that not everyone is complaining when they play. I have fun almost every time.

This post aims to bring awareness to an issue and perhaps get a pointer to where I can get help seeing that Epic Support has stopped responding to my messages. This also aims to spark conversation on whether its right to deactivate user's accounts for using a VPN or changing their MAC Address if they haven't received a ban prior for cheating.


First off I'd like to iterate that I am upset, but desperate to return the community I've watched grow for 14+ years. It is in my best interest to have access to and work with the Unreal Engine that is miraculously open source for individuals like myself to learn with. I've had a lot of inspiration for my career derive itself from watching Epic and playing games released by this company and it hurts to have to let it go under such circumstances. With that being said I'm looking for a more appropriate place to hold this topic to a conversation, and I've yet to find a place on the Epic Forums devoted to such. *Speaks to the issue doesn't it...*


I was unaware this game will ban and even go as far as to [deactivate](https://puu.sh/BrgSS/80c2996129.png) an entire account for the usage of a VPN or if it detects you've changed your MAC Address. I have never been banned for doing so from any other game out there and I'm baffled as to why Epic Support refuses to look further into this upon request. 


I am certain my account was deactivated for this specific reason because I knowingly played on their servers with a different MAC Address:

On Sunday, August 19th, at 10PM EST~ internet access on my computer was disabled for the duration of the night through some settings applied to the router, and was set to do so every every night going forward. Being the smart ass I am, I changed the Mac Address on my computer to prevent the router from recognizing my machine to regain access to the internet during nights. *Don't ask, I'm sure some of you out there have strict parents...*

On Wednesday, August 22nd I logged in and played with a friend for a couple of hours, into the early morning of Thursday, August 23rd. Throughout the night I was playing with a MAC Address different from my original.

Roughly a week later, when attempting to log into my account again, I noticed it was giving me an [error on the client that prevented me from logging in.](https://puu.sh/Bri08/f0798f3a19.png)


I was pretty upset considering I just lost access to a lot of things at once; Unreal Tournament, the Unreal Editor, the Founder's Edition of Fortnite; Save the World I acquired back in the early alpha stages, and any future titles released by Epic Games.


I immediately began looking into [the EULA provided by the Epic Games' Fortnite site](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/eula)
Archived September 3rd: http://archive.is/phhWr


In Section 2. License Conditions, we are given a warning that the software may contain ""Cheat Detection"" software. 

In Section 16. Defintions, we are given definitions that declare what cheats are.

“Cheat Detection” means functionality intended to identify Cheats.

“Cheats” means programs or other processes which may give players an unfair competitive advantage in the Software.


As far as I am aware, changing a MAC Address or using a VPN does not fall under the ""Cheating"" category here, and as such the EULA attached to this game does not warn users about such activity breaching the agreement. What I believe was detected by the anti cheat software was the program ""Technitium MAC Address Changer"" or TMAC for short. **This program is not a program designed for cheating. It is a program designed for changing the MAC Address, and enabling/disabling Network connections at the click of a button. All of which can be done manually without the use of said program.** Why is this considered to be a ""Cheat Program"" if it has nothing to do with ""giving players an unfair competitive advantage in the Software."" And does this mean they've fish netted other programs that can get you banned unknowingly?


**What about the in-game message that pops up when you get disconnected for using a VPN, etc?**

[The warning](https://i.redd.it/v9prtmf76fn01.png) is poorly worded and doesn't indicate you will then be subsequently banned for continuing to use a VPN or proxy service. My friend and I have had this pop up while playing (They're in Washington Sate, I'm in Florida...) and at the time we both thought nothing of it. Several months had passed without anything happening so we assumed it was just a server side error and everyone had been disconnected from that particular server. 
**I say this is a poorly worded warning considering no where in this message does it indicate you will receive a ban or account deactivation if you continue to play under a VPN, it merely suggests that it will remove you from matches, and recommend you turn the VPN off.**

*The night I played with a different MAC Address, I never received this warning.*




**You were probably banned for cheating.**


In the 14+ years I've been playing videogames I have never used a cheat program or anything of the sorts to give myself an advantage over others. I hate cheaters with a passion and would never stoop to their level. To get a better idea of my experience, [have a look at this steam account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveDeer/), and [Battlelog](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/user/XplosiveDeer/)


Nearing 9 thousand hours on Team Fortress 2 alone, combined with the hundreds of hours spent in the Battlefield and Call of Duty titles beginning with the very first released titles (I still have the CDs!) in those series (i.e CoD, Battlefield 1942, etc) and not forgetting the multiple copies of all the Unreal Tournament games in CD format and on Steam, I have acquired a flexible skill set. Funny enough, nothing from these titles prepared me for the concept of building mid-fight, so when it comes to placing walls and ramps in Fortnite, I suck and I'm certain if I knew of a stats site for Fortnite, it would show my mediocre attempts at playing the game.


[This isn't the first time I've been banned under false premises either.](https://youtu.be/z9GQO_bAPqQ)


The deactivation of my account feels unwarranted as I've had a clean history on the Epic Games services since the day I made the account. Deactivating an account because the user was using a VPN or changing their MAC Address without having first banned them for cheating is quite silly, and I've **never seen another company do this.** 
**[The final response I was given by Epic's support team](https://puu.sh/BriTj/dd982614dc.png) felt like a huge slap to the face. It feels like someone took all of 2 minutes to read my messages and then brush it under the rug with a pre-made response telling me their anti-cheat is almighty and never makes mistakes.**


**TLDR:**

I strongly believe I have had my account deactivated inappropriately. The use of VPNs or the changing of a MAC Address is not listed as something that is against the terms of agreement in the [the EULA provided by the Epic Games' Fortnite site](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/eula)
Archived September 3rd: http://archive.is/phhWr

Deactivating the accounts of users who have used or are using a VPN or changing their MAC Address without having first received a ban for *Cheating,* doesn't make much sense to me as it does not give the user an advantage over others like a *""Cheat""* would as defined by Epic in their EULA.

**I asked Epic Support to look into the ban further, but was denied.** [Have a look at my steam account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveDeer/), and [Battlelog](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/user/XplosiveDeer/) to get a better idea of just how long I've been playing videogames.

I see many people wishing it was easier to get materials. 

I wondered what people might think of the option to add an Auto Pickaxe feature to help ease the monotony of farming for materials. Just like auto run, you could press the button twice and your pickaxe keeps swinging until you turn it off or put it away.

Im not sure if this would benefit PC players as much too, but I personally get tired of having to hold down trigger when I am breaking down things like fences with bushes around them. If i could combine auto-walk with auto pickaxe I could just walk around a house directing my guy while he farms. It would make you vulnerable so it wouldnt be a good option other than for early game farming.

Its just an idea I had to try and make farming a little easier, and honestly just more ergonomical. Controllers are bad for your hands, lets face it. The less time I have to be holding down any button , the better. Which is why auto run was so good imo. 

Maybe this is the ultra lazy, not important feature that people will see as useless. Not married to this idea, just wondered if it had been discussed or proposed before. Wanted to know what people thought. Let me know if it has some glaring weakness or is just a terrible idea. ",FortNiteBR

For reference, I have been playing since season 2 and have a 20% win rate.


Fortnite is a game of skill and a game of chance. While skill is the most important aspect to winning a game in my opinion, the game is highly influenced by randomness. This randomness comes in many forms, the most dominant being weapon drops. You are more likely to do well with a gold scar than you are with a basic assault rifle.


All competitive games have an element of randomness. CS:GO has random bullet spread. League of Legends has the critical hit mechanic. Both can turn the tides of battle in favour of the worse player. Fortnite is no different.


While this randomness is there, I believe that it doesn't actually matter. Why do I think that? I think that because a highly skilled player is more likely to win a fight against a noob, no matter what resources each player has. A noob with a gold scar will do better against a pro than a noob with a basic assault rifle, but the pro is still favoured to win in both situations. The gold scar gives the noob a higher chance of beating a pro, but the pro will still prevail.


So what does this mean for the game? Essentially, it means that there is a trickle-up economy. Over time, the better resources spread from the worst players in the game to the best players. If a good player doesn't pick up a scar early in the match, there's a decent chance that they will still end up with one in the top 3. This is because they are good enough to kill noobs who have gold scars.


What does any of this have to do with loot llamas? Well, it's the same concept. While opening a loot llama and getting 1,800 resources may seem crazy, it isn't. 


If a noob opens the llama and gets the resources, they will most likely get killed by a better player regardless. The better player then picks up the resources which are unspent.


If a pro opens the llama and gets the resources, they have cut out the middleman, and the resources are in the hands they would end up in if a noob picked them up.


So no matter who opens the llama, the economy will trickle-up the resources to the better players, or they will be removed from the game by being wasted. The advantage given to a noob by an 1,800 material llama is neglible compared to the skill of a better player.


The arguement which reduces the llamas to 600 mats is the same argument you would use to remove the gold scar from the game. ""It gives an unfair advantage to the player who picks it up"". Well, yes? That's what makes the game fun. The randomness keeps the game fresh.


""But _Decipher, the 600 mats still gives the advantage to the player who picks it up. Why does it have to be 1,800 mats?"".


I hear you, but this is why I think it needs to hold 1,800 mats. There are four reasons.


Firstly, the llama acts as a magnet. It pulls players to it and forces fights. The greater the number of materials in the llama, the stronger the pull of the magnet. This can be shown in League of Legends. The dragon and Baron Nasher are both magnets which force fights. However, the reward given by Baron is greater, and is therefore a stronger magnet. This means that Baron forces more fights. To keep the mid-game from being stale, you want these forced fights. Each of the three llamas has the potential to act as a randomly placed tilted towers.


Secondly, the risk vs reward. I see so many llamas at the moment. Many more than I ever did when they were released. Am I just getting lucky? Unlikely. It's more likely that people are choosing not to pick them up because they're not worth the risk. Back when they were released, you had to stay still for like 5 seconds to open the llama. This made you an easy target for headshots. And even with the negative, people still risked opening them because the reward inside was worth it.


Nowadays you can move while opening the llama by using the pickaxe and it takes half the time. And yet, many people are not opening llamas. It's because the reward of 600 materials is not worth the risk that someone is watching.


Thirdly, the more materials there are in a llama, the more likely it is for materials to pass on to the next player. This increases the effect of the trickle-up economy, which means that the final 3 players will have more materials without having to gather resources. This is good for the final fight, as it allows people to fight without being held back. You get to display your building, shooting and logistical skills vs someone else who is also not held back. The better player is more likely to win.


And finally, vending machines. If you open a loot llama with 600 of each material, you have the ability to buy three gold weapons from a gold vending machine. This puts three powerful weapons into the economy, which a good player can use to win the game, and a bad player can use to supply those that are good.",FortNiteBR

1 We NEED to be able to edit without holding down a button. Those 3 or 4 seconds make a huge difference on controller especially when you play on a pc like I do! Especially If we have elite or scuff controller we should have the option of using a paddle to one click no timer edit.

2 Please give controller users a Separate Sensitivity for building and shooting. It’s simply not fair that we have to sacrifice accuracy for build speed or build speed for accuracy

You can’t make Fortnite a competitive e-sports game and not address these issues. Your hosting tournaments and Skirmishes while the players using controller are at a dis advantage. I respect keyboard players because I own a pc my self but I also want the console and controller users to be heard! Please guys I need your support on this so we can get this added.  Epic your great at listening to the community so hear us out! No more adding stuff like thanking the bus driver until this is dealt with please! We will happily give you our money for skins but we need these 2 things to enjoy the game. An example is if someone on controller is being sprayed by Smgs, you can’t edit out of the back of your building because by the time you hold down edit your dead. This can’t work for competitive it’s a joke. We had to survive Matt nerfs and all types of building nerds,  don’t make competitive players suffer more than this.

There is no excuse for shotguns being used as a cheeky upfront burst damage with an instantaneous swap to another gun. 

If you're using a shotgun, the weapon has delay between shots. Cheating that delay by swapping weapons is a load of bullshit. 

You can't even argue this tactic isn't op, you see every top player worth a damn doing it. The tommy gun makes it even worse than it otherwise would be, but people were pulling the same bullshit when the P90 was OP. 

if shotguns need buffed to compensate, so be it, but enough of this frontloading a shotgun shot and swapping instantly to another weapon. ",FortNiteBR

I played destiny for almost 5 years, I then switched over to fortnite as my main game but the one thing I miss about destiny is the weekly events. Wether it was iron banner (pvp mode with rewards) or faction rally (PvE event with rewards) these events really made you want to play and grind for the rewards.

I think if epic took this idea and had a rotation of weekly events dropping every couple of weeks for a week it would keep the game fresh and interesting for everyone. I know they already have different LTM that drop but they are just simple variants really not like this new getaway mode that is completely different. If they could come up with a few more of these weekly events, have rewards based on them modes for doing certain challenges in them and rotate them. I.e have 1 or 2 getaway events per season I think it would keep the more casual player base engaged. 

Just a thought of course ",FortNiteBR

1 We NEED to be able to edit without holding down a button. Those 3 or 4 seconds make a huge difference on controller especially when you play on a pc like I do! Especially If we have elite or scuff controller we should have the option of using a paddle to one click no timer edit.

2 Please give controller users a Separate Sensitivity for building and shooting. It’s simply not fair that we have to sacrifice accuracy for build speed or build speed for accuracy

You can’t make Fortnite a competitive e-sports game and not address these issues. Your hosting tournaments and Skirmishes while the players using controller are at a dis advantage. I respect keyboard players because I own a pc my self but I also want the console and controller users to be heard! Please guys I need your support on this so we can get this added.  Epic your great at listening to the community so hear us out! No more adding stuff like thanking the bus driver until this is dealt with please!

Basically, if anyone would be kind enough to add me as a friend to play, duos, sqauad, or their group of friends, it would be kindly appreciated.

The only relief I get from all my woes is being able to play PC. But somedays I get to the point where I'll play a match or two and turn off my system, because I feel so defeated and empty inside. It's simply not fun.

Epic, I've been playing fortnite since the day it came out, and I really dont like playing squads or duos due to reasons I dont want to explain for the 50th time. 

Anyway, in recent days, I feel a bit shafted when it comes to Ltms. Either there's never a solo version of the ltm or it's there for only one day before becoming duos or solos, I always feel like Epic doesnt really consider the people who hate to play duos and squads when they make their decisions. I mean, I guess it's understandable, you know, squads probably makes them a lot of money, it just sucks that that's probably what motivates their decisions instead of the satisfaction of the players. 

And now the getaway ltm. Such a cool fucking limited time mode, but it's only available in squads and I havent seen anything about there being a solo version (honestly, even if there is one they'll probably only have it out for like a day before they take it down) And there are challenges that can only be completed in squads. So now, you have me and probably others, playing in fill squads cause I dont have anyone to play with and literally torturing myself with loss after loss after loss after loss to get these cosmetics. 

I honestly just feel a bit shafted by Epic, and that's not really what game companies want so I thought I would mention it. But whatevs, even if they do see this post they dont have to care, they'll still make their millions no matter what so whatever. ",FortNiteBR

Hear me out. I have an amazing PC but I play on PS4 because I feel like the game plays better.

On PC everything is too easy. Aiming is obviously extremely good but beyond that jumping, switching to build mode, even switching to pickaxe can all be done instantly without taking away from your aim. Also you can switch to any gun you like instantly, the order of them doesn’t matter at all. The speed you can turn and build is also too much without it even affecting your aim. Even reloading, you never take your hand off the aim.
Also editing is instant and you don’t have to lose aiming, edit kills are so easy...

I prefer it when the controls are limiting and it’s difficult to do a lot of things.

If we got full custom controls, seperate building sensitivity, instant edit. It would play just like PC which I’m not a fan of.

I think I actually prefer it before builder pro came out. Building was hard and you couldn’t just spam whatever.

Obviously this is the same for every player and the average PC player is better so I’m not saying console is harder I’m just saying the game plays out better on it.

I’m decent at this game only coz I have a lot of time to play right now. If they add custom controls I’ll have no choice but to use it as much as possible to stay ahead and it will become more like PC.",FortNiteBR

1) I adore Epic, and the effort that they go through to respond and take in criticism. 
2) TL:DR will be at the bottom
3) Fortnite cannot still reasonably be in beta, stop thinking it is. 


**What I'm tired of**
I see a post criticising EPIC, maybe a little harshly but they made valid points so whatever. All the comments are always the same. 

""Stop whining, you're entitled, be thankful EPIC pays attention to us at all""

You are DAMN right I'm entitled, this is a massive company with experience in optimizing games and multiplayer experiences. 

I have every right to complain, I have every right to criticize, especially if you offer a solution. You have no right to tell me that I'm whining, if I'm combining about perfectly reasonable things to whine about. 


**My main issue**
Epic is a massive company, you all likely heard the media exploding about it making &gt;$1 Billion in the last year, they have a huge dev team, and they are also responsible for the classics, Gears of War 1-3. 

This is not an indie studio. This is not an inexperienced team. *Why are we getting results like it is?*

The amount of issues with the game is nuts. Switch gameplay is disgusting, poor framerates, no career tab (seriously you have no excuse for that one, why hasn't it been implemented). This game should be optimized for basically any console. Kinda like the whole Skyrim model, you can run that game on a toaster (I can play Skyrim on my laptop at 30 fps consistently, fortnite? More like 8-12)

The PUBG graphics meme still exists, it's just less common. The beginning loading screen, when opening the game (on XBone), doesn't make a lick of sense, GTAV loads faster FFS. Whenever I place a trap on Xbox, it freezes the entire game 85% of the time. 

You made 1 billion dollars in a year. Hire more staff, or step up your game. These kinds of issues are just not fun to experience, and make you look sloppy. 

**The WORST Excuse**
Something you'll hear alot here is:

""Hey man it's just a beta, they don't need to be perfect""

If you think they're still a beta you are mistaken. Betas shouldn't ever under any circumstances offer any sort of microtransactions, if any other company did this, they'd get flamed, we are on version 5.4, this ""beta"" is a loophole

IIRC Microsoft has limitations on the ability for a game to update, this ""beta"" allows EPIC to apply hotfixes and faster updates. That's it. I doubt we'll see this game be fully ""released"" any time soon. 

**TL:DR**
&gt;Complaining about issues is completely justified, we are entitled to a good experience from a triple A, billion dollar company
&gt;Fortnite is not optimized at all, is plagued with performance issues that shouldn't be complicated, and is composed sloppily 
&gt;Fortnite is not a beta, that's an excuse to release hotfixes and updates faster. 

If you think I'm in the wrong, let me know, I'm open to all opinions, I kinda just wanted to vent because I'm sick of these issues building up and ruining my experience. I'd like to reiterate that I think EPIC is ~~one of~~ the most responsive developers out there, and work hard to creat a good experience. EPIC will always have my support, I'm just a lil salty",FortNiteBR

My theory begins with the Thanos game mode in fortnite. The LTM made me aware that epic is part owned by Disney (as Disney owns parts of marvel)

Now, Thors last standalone movie was Thor ragnorok.

It may not have been made entirely clear in that movie, but ragnorok in thors universe means the end of times. In one animated Thor movie, the hulk went to Asgard and started killing off the gods, this was ragnorak, the end of Asgard. 

Asgard is a very highly regarded place. 

Fortnite is a very highly regarded game.

Season 5 tier 100 character is ragnorok.
The FINAL character is also a nod to the end of times.

Now, based on average playtimes and challenge battle stars, it was JUST around the time that players began naturally unlocking ragnorok that the cube was released on us. 

Coincidence? No. 

Season 4 saw omega launch a rocket, now it is debatable but omega was the villain of last season. Is ragnorok the villain of this season? Is the cube is ultimate weapon for bringing an end to fortnite as we know it? Time will tell... ",FortNiteBR

I sent an email to Epic and received a response a day later: [https://puu.sh/BqWT0/3191b9c07d.png](https://puu.sh/BqWT0/3191b9c07d.png)

So they made it seem like if it was just an error in their system, then it would be resolved. I've never shared my account with anyone and have never used a VPN/cheated so I figured it would be resolved.

The next day I received this: [https://puu.sh/BqWQP/6605cbb733.png](https://puu.sh/BqWQP/6605cbb733.png)

People now think that Kevin holds a terrible evil.

I don’t think so.

This is just a theory, and I’m probably wrong, but I am going to say that Kevin is not some evil artifact. I am going to make a rather large statement, but Kevin is actually some sort of time machine. This may sound far fetched, but I have reasoning.

In the week 10 loading screen (can’t link as I’m on mobile) notice that Dark Bomber has the same color shirt and hair as Brite Bomber. If Dark Bomber was a dark version of Brite Bomber, the shirt would probably be black. There is a dragon on her shirt though.

Why I think Dark Bomber looks like she does is that someone did something terrible to her. Dark Bomber is Brite Bomber from the future. The reason Dark Bomber is time traveling, I think, it that Rex, CTL, or Drift might be our culprit for this happening.

I think after the incident, Dark Bomber was considering time travel to alter the past so that her current state is restored. She remembered the rift and saw her chance.

She does whatever you need to do to time travel, but ends up trapped inside Kevin. The reason the runes are being printed is to release her. This plan goes well until she realizes that Drift, Rex, CTL, and her past self have become interested in Kevin. Cue week 9 and 10 loading screens. What happens next? I have not theorized yet.

TL;DR: Dark Bomber is Brite Bomber from the future",FortNiteBR

I think it would be better if the Emote Wheel functioned exactly as it does in game, if you need to change tabs just cancel the wheel. 

Clicking R3 also shouldn't bring up the wheel. Why not just use down to bring up the emote 
wheel and that chooses what you'll currently emote when you press R3? Most people are used to pressing r3 and immediately emoting and it's also how people NSYNC because it's one button press. That's pretty much impossible now and requires verbal cues and makes it feel kind of lame.

Right now, i just think its unfair that a Double Barrel can do much more damage to the stomach than a pump does to the head in close-close range. Yeah, i know its ment to be a really close range weapon but its just unfair to get yeeted with one shot of the Double Barrel doing 150 damage.

I've really noticed the performance fixes, too. The framerate still suffers in encounters with lots of players, but building loading seems much improved (no more bobbing up and down for ten seconds in limbo, waiting for the building to load!) First pickup freeze seems fixed as well, which makes a big early game difference. AND you added an axis option to the controls, meaning I can finally use my Pro Controller again!

Everyone is intrigued by what appears to be an evil or at least different version of Brite Bomber inside the cube. This on its own is pretty interesting and can lead to assumptions about next season, but that's not the only clue that dropped today.

The [Hacivat](https://www.stormshield.one/pvp/cosmetics/10048) skin was also datamined. At first I assumed this was a skin based on a Robin Hood type character until I saw the corresponding [backbling](https://www.stormshield.one/pvp/cosmetics/10048) that looks nothing like a Robin Hood-esque backbling.

So I googled Hacivat which led to [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karag%C3%B6z_and_Hacivat) which details two characters, Karagöz and Hacivat, who are characters in a play that can be done with puppets, as a shadow play, or other performance mediums, which further connects with [Hacivat's glider](https://www.stormshield.one/pvp/cosmetics/10068). 

Where things really get interesting is the description of the two characters and their relationship. The wiki page described the two as ""foils of each other"" or mirror images. Much like the leaked loading screen.

What is means for season 6 is unclear but having two different piece of datamined content both point towards mirrored images of characters or a similar relationship is a huge tell for what we can expect soon. ",FortNiteBR

Blackout won’t having building, but it also won’t have weapon bloom. They said no weapon rarities for Blackout because the think it’s sloppy game design. So there won’t be a guy with a better version of your AR in damage just because he’s luckier.

Camping is said not be a way to win, and that there are strong counter measures against it.

Also Blackout games are very very fast compared to Fortnites.

No night day cycle in Blackout because they want everyone to be able to see clearly. Fortnite has cycling day and night.

So which do you think will require more “skill” to win? The faster gameplay with a high importance put on good aim, or the slower game with a high importance on building to high ground.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

In this new update (5.4) Epic introduced the new LTM called the Getaway LTM. Now this is a good concept, but with all the text and pop-ups that are in this mode make it very hard to concentrate. Every time someone collects a Jewel, a huge yellow thing appears at the bottom-left and it gets really hard to see someone sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then they changed a lot of rarities- a bit too much.  Don't get me wrong, but i think the no common SMG is fine but although you have a higher spawn right for Epic and Legendary varieties getting rid of the Rare RPG is a bit over the top. And what was the point of removing the legendary Bolt and Blue Pistol? 

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst I do like the fact that 2 of the 3 burst shots are more accurate, I do feel that the rise of the SMGs should bring back a pump that does 200+ damage head shot or at least not do 7 at close range. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I think the next point is probably a result of the new content. After the new update playing the game is super laggy and it's not just me that say this, it's my friends that experience too and at the same time. Say for example, early game when you land somewhere crowded in the Getaway LTM, it lags a lot and I have heard from my PC friend that his frame dropped a lot (don't think it's his PC because he usually has at least 150 FPS). So if you can try and stabilize the game it would be millions of times better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so now you are probably thinking I forgot of the good changes, bu no I do know of the shield stack going up to 3 and dropping the semi-auto to Blue and Green (the right colour for the damage). So, thank you Epic, but a lot of these changes are looked down upon by me and my friends; especially try and fix the lag. ",FortNiteBR

With the new game mode being terrible for solo players, the challenges being delayed AGAIN, and all the unnecessary nerfs and buffs to weapons, it's finally gotten to a point where I've had it with this game.

I started in early season 4, and I'm not even going to make it to 6.. This game has become almost unplayable, and the gap between new players and pros is getting larger and larger by each day!!

I wanted this game to be one that I'll never stop playing, but it's barely been 8 months, and I'm getting sick of it..

Rant over... LET THE HATE COMMENTS FLOW!! ",FortNiteBR

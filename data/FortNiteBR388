At the same time, you would also be a target for a completely different player.


Whenever you kill your target, a different player would become your new mark. Likewise, if an assassin dies prior to taking out their target, the mark would be assigned as a new target for a living assassin.


Friendly Fire would essentially be disabled to prevent the game mode from playing out like any other normal solo match. I'd love the feeling of hunting down my target while simultaneously looking over my shoulder constantly in fear of my assassin tailing me.

Haha I laugh at these noobs and their ..... (builds)....What you want to do is build a small 1x1 and camp in a bush next it.....Boom easy kill....I know what you're thinking(holy shit this guy just blew my mind!)........Yes....yes I did, and that's why I'm the best in the world.

Number 2: Crossbow is really the only gun that you need.....Infinite ammo....Uh yeah you heard it right!  The Crossbow has INFINITE AMMO.....nuff said...

Number 3:  Loot Lake is where you should be landing 90% of the time....Loot Lake has the same amount of loot as Tilted Towers and it's a tenth the size....POINT MADE....It's not called Loot Lake for nuthin!

Number 4:  If you do pick up a gun(because you obviously haven't found a Crossbow yet)....ALWAYS go full auto...More bullets coming out of your gun = more of a chance to hit your opponent!  Just hold R2 and pray to RNGeesus....

Number 5:  If you've followed any of game breaking tips you've probably already racked up a few hundred wins today alone, BUT if you are still having trouble late game and can't seem to pull of the final kill to get the Victory, I still have one tip left.....This tip takes Patience, a little luck, and nerves of fucking steel....Things you will need 1: The almighty bush!(make sure you haven't activated it yet!..there is a reason that it is almost impossible to get!) 2: Smoke grenades(as many as you can carry).....So here is what you do:  It's just you and the last guy left.  Once you spot him, start shooting at him to give away your position, once he starts to push you throw all of your smokes on the ground around you and build a 1x1 with a roof on it(smokes will block him being able to see you)....after you get the decoy base built, you activate the bush while you are covered by the smoke.  The last guy will be looking for you and when the smoke clears he will see a base with a roof on it (and will think you are inside...PS- metal works best because he won't be able to peek inside!)  Inevitably he will start shooting at the base that you just built, or rush and get on top of it and try to break the top, giving you a nice easy shot.....Ur welcome...",FortNiteBR

But holy fuck, the state the game is in is horrible. (at least for me?)

The sound of weapons is ludicrously loud. The sound also lags like crazy and sometimes comes several seconds later than it should. 

I also have alot of framedrops which I didn't have before at all. 

And the worst of all is I wasn't able to finish 5 games today, because the game crashes all the time. 

Please roll out version 2.0 or whatever again so I can play the  fucking game.

Please note that the lagging is definitely not caused due to bad hardware. I have what people would consider a high end computer. (Ryzen 7 1700x, 32gigs of ram and a GTX1080)

I don't care if you add 500 new weapons in 3 weeks. I was fine before the release of all those fancy weapons.

I would love to play the game and throw all my money at the skins. Please allow me to do so by fixing it.

My idea is that we bring a clan system to fortnite!
With custom emblems and maybe even clan battles (total amount of wins scores during a certain time) and the winner earns ""Clan- Bucks"".
These clan bucks can be exchanged for exclusive clan skins or banners!
You can also earn these by completing the daily clan quest(s).
Introducing this would make the game even more fun and a little more competitive during the ""Clan Wars"".
I'm not very sure about the clan wars yet but I'm very curious about a clan system in general.

When u been playing console for 20+ years and then switch to PC, it feels like you're a baby again who can't walk, talk, or wipe ur own butt.

Right when I get good enough to consistently get 5-10 kills a game, I decide to purchase the ultimate gaming pc.

There's no going back now!

My xbox is only good for netflix, and Halo.

Once I get the controls down I will be a god compared to my console self. This is so much fun!

I see a lot of people asking if STW is worth it compared to V-Buck prices, and I have to share my 11-day experience with you guys just to give you an idea of how many V-Bucks the game really gives.

11 days ago the game was 19.99$ and me and 2 of my friends bought it immediately. Our primary goal was to get the Battle Pass for Season 3, and in this post I'll give you a breakdown of how Save the World gives you VBucks.

- - -

**•Are V-Bucks from Save the World usable in Battle Royale?**

YES. Vbucks are Vbucks, you can use them in either game.

- - -


**•How long after purchasing STW did it take you to buy the Battle Pass for Season 3?**

6 hours of gameplay, I could've done it quicker if I knew what to do. But surely, by the end of the day, I had my Battle Pass ready with 50 more Vbucks to spare.

- - -

**•How many Vbucks does STW give?**

Let's break it down.


1.*Login Bonuses*


You get the following rewards just for logging in. These rewards are pretty damn good imo.

**Save the World: Login Bonuses**

Day 11 – 50 V-Bucks

Day 28 – 300 V-Bucks

Day 35 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 49 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 56 – 300 V-Bucks

Day 70 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 77 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 84 – 300 V-Bucks

Day 91 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 98 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 105 – 150 V-Bucks

**Day 112 – 800 V-Bucks**

Day 119 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 126 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 133 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 140 – 300 V-Bucks

Day 147 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 154 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 161 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 168 – 300 V-Bucks

Day 175 – 150 V-Bucks

Day 182 – 150 V-Bucks

2.*Daily Quests*: APART FROM THAT, you get Daily Quests that take about 15-20 minutes to complete that give you **50 Vbucks every day**. Daily missions stack upto three just like Battle Royale.

3.*Other Challenges*: There are ""Storm Shield Missions"" and other side challenges that also give you 100 or 50 Vbucks.

4.*Collection Book*: There is a ""Collection Book"" in STW where you can permanently slot bad/duplicate heroes, weapons, etc for rewards. A few of these are straight up **500 Vbucks** rewards, you can read the full list [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/early-access/feedback/2008-collection-book-rewards-level-1-100-meow). The list has changed somewhat, but it'll give you an idea of the Vbuck income.

- - -

**•Do skills from STW carry over to Battle Royale?**

Just the building. Combat is way too different and interesting, in the sense that you have heroes with abilities and stuff. The game is grindy though after a while, but still a hell lotta fun.

- - -

**•How many Vbucks have you made?**

3100 Vbucks in 11 days.

- - -

**•How does STW compare to Store Vbucks in terms of prices?**

I definitely feel STW is better if you don't want to go for the higher packages of Vbucks, especially when 50% off (which it isn't currently).

If you play BR a lot and just want the Battle Pass and don't like STW, the 1000 Vbuck deal is better for you.

- - -

**•When will STW be free?**

Sometime in 2018, we still don't know when.

- - -

**•Is Save The World good?**

I equally loved it and Battle Royale. I love the pressure/paranoia in Battle Royale, while I love the open style tower-defense in Save the World.

There are some problems with the game, just like there are with Battle Royale, but I'm having a total blast. You have hoverboards (first Fortnite vehicle), all kinds of swords and axes, laser weapons, all weapons from BR, great characters, and most importantly it is a completely different game from BR, but in the same world. A great change of pace after a long BR session.

You might want to check some gameplay on Youtube before going for it.

I definitely think I got value for money with the 19.99$ purchase. HOWEVER, if you don't enjoy it, grinding for Vbucks can become a chore.

- - -


**•You bought it at 19.99$. Is it worth 39.99$ though?**

That is up to you. Check the gameplay, understand the game, and if you think it's your thing, go for it! 

However if you're the kind of person who wants a skin every few days, the grind may not be worth it and you should probably go for the higher Vbucks packages at this point.

- - -

**How do you pay for Save the World?**

One time payment via Credit Card or Paypal (I used Paypal).

- - -

Hope this post helps.

Grab a shotgun, use a shield, slugfest battle someone with the same, repeat. Even when you win those, he said, it doesn’t feel earned. Just feels like you had enough shield to outlast the opponent. 

I have to say I agree. While I enjoy the building mechanic, it’s mainly used in the beginning and middle game to make cover and close the gap between opponents so that a shotgun battle can begin. 

Without completely changing the game, I can’t see how this can be fixed.

But the one thing that bugs me about this game is close quarters fights are decided by who can spastically jump and perfectly aim better. It makes the fights seem so silly. And I guess it's because of the way aiming/bloom works and how they have shotguns coded.

I do remember when they did Shooting Test 1 and it seemed shotguns got a lot more of a penalty for doing this bullshit, I may be wrong.

I actuallly won my first game on shooting test 1 using mostly a silenced pistol/smg and AR. I found the experience personally much more enjoyable because it was harder for people to jump around like a chinchilla on crack while headshotting you for 167 dmg with a tac.


Tl:dr - anyone else sick of the jumping shotgun spam that this game devolves into? Shouldn't shotguns have more penalty with aiming when you jump constantly? 

I basically think the shotgun reticle should expand to the entire size of your screen if you jump  (/s)

But I really liked shooting model 1 and how it dealt with shotguns.

You will be unable to start Fortnite without this program. The easiest way to install it is to just exit the EAC launcher and run the game again from the Epic Games Launcher and click yes when the EAC install prompt comes up from Windows.

If the prompt doesn't come up for some reason you will have to install it manually following these steps:

Navigate to the Easy Anti Cheat folder in your Fortnite install directory [Default is C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\EasyAnt iCheat Folder]

Locate EasyAntiCheat_Setup.exe

Double click the file

Click the install Easy Anti Cheat button

Some of the specs are below (the new 2018 edition comes out in a couple weeks):

Quad-core 8th gen Intel Core i-series processor

GPU: Radeon RX Vega M or Nvidia GeForce MX150

4k UHD Screen


I've done some research on the graphics cards and everything, but there are just so many different types that I don't know whats better. I currently have a 2012 HP Pavilion (I believe it has an AMD Radeon HD 6490M). I have to use the lowest settings possible and it still does not run well, it gets extremely hot, and the fan kicks on high instantly.

I really like the HP Spectre x360 15 in 2018 edition, however I want to play Fortnite with it running smoothly. I know I can just get a gaming laptop, but I wanted something slimmer, lightweight, and sleek looking that I can carry around with me if I need to.

So my ultimate question is, do you think if I got the HP Spectre x360 with one of the above graphic cards, I would be able to run Fortnite on at least decent settings?

Thanks.

Pretty much every time this dance is done it's in situations where they have no business gloating either. It's always after I down and eliminate two of their squadmates while all 4 are rushing me that someone does the dance when the finally kill me. What are you celebrating? The fact that one guy killed half your team?

I've never seen it used in a situation where boasting makes sense. It's never a guy that kills two people for the win or a whole squad eliminating a whole squad. It's always people that win by happenstance that do the dance. I spectated a guy that had one kill while the rest of his squad eliminated two entire other squads and he started doing that dance.

It just makes you look toxic.

For so long, I’ve always wanted a scuf controller, but there was no way in hell I’d drop $140+ on a controller. I lost hope. Every competitive Fortnite console player knows jumping with the X button is *not* a good idea (you have to take your thumb off R3 to jump, which completely fucks your aim). To combat this, I switched my R3 and X buttons, so I jumped with R3 and crouched with X. This worked well and I won plenty of matches doing this, but crouching before/during gunfights was quite difficult, and it got me killed many times. 

Today, I came across the strikepack for $40. This is a detachable device that gives you two paddles on the back of your controller, the whole reason I’ve always been tempted to buy a scuf. Now, my jump button is my right paddle, my build button is my left paddle, and I’ve reverted back to crouch with R3. With this setup, I almost *never* have to take my thumb off the right stick(other than reloading, but that’s not a big deal). It’s taking a bit to get used to, but I know it will benefit me massively once I fully get the hang of it. I highly recommend this purchase to anyone who takes Fortnite seriously.

How do you counter it?  If you're stuck with it, you should be able to check for it on your body by checking your inventory screen.  A small icon will appear in a location where your eye doesn't normally look when switching weapons.  If you see it there, you can pry it off my clicking on it.

I feel it loses some of the best parts of the genre. The drop, the looting, the suspense and the competitiveness. First of all I will talk about the drop. Its too easy and its too flexible. I will be comparing lots of stuff with PUBG for its the only other real BR game thats popular right now and I feel although its a buggy, unfinished and hacker filled mess with poor servers and performance with dumb shit like desync and client side servers it gets the main aspect of Battle Royal perfectly.

So in the drop phase in Pubg the planes route has a large effect on how the game is played. Both maps in PUBG are 8x8km squared. On the plane you can go ~2km by skydiving alone and ~3km by parachuting instantly, this leaves at least ~16km of the map out of the reach of the plane including the water but with routes closer to the maps edge this can increase by a large amount. With this knowledge you can predict where players will and wont be and you can make plans around your drop. Also, the parachute is much harder to land accurately and travels much less of a distance and so is much, much harder to land than Fortnites chute as its just way too flexible and makes landing anywhere simple. The ~3x3km squared map is fully available to all drops and I feel it takes a bit of tactics and flesh out of quite an important feature of the genre.

Now too the looting. Fortnites looting is crap, im sorry. Yeah sure it doesnt have worthless shite like shirts. But the loot is completely random and not weighted in the slightest. This I feel is really stupid. In PUBG, areas such as School, Mil Airfield, Haciena del Patron and Prison have a high chance of dropping good loot and so have a high pop density. In Fortnite, the loot is the same everywhere other than quantity and so luck plays much more of a factor than risk like in PUBG.

Onto suspense. I feel Fortnite doesnt really build it up for me atleast. The small map size means meeting players is common and thats pretty cool, however... I feel Fortnites cartoony art style makes players stand out and makes the terrain easily surveyed. Houses are also well lit and foliage isnt an issue really. In PUBG you can basically walk over an enemy and I feel this adds a ton to the games suspense. Common enemies that stand out is like every other FPS game however rare enemies that are hidden in the shadows and buildings really builds up a sense of fear.

And finally and probably the most important thing I feel fortnite failed with is its competitiveness. I have no doubt a good fortnite player will hammer a bad one and I have no doubt there are those who consistently win games but I feel certain aspects of Fortnite are dumb and ruin the 'battle royale feel'.
My main issues with its competitiveness is...
1)Loot tiers-Utter bullshit, sorry but although RNG is a big aspect of battle royale games, finding a good gun should give you a chance and should give you the ability to kill even the most stacked of enemies. Sure in pubg, pistols are shite, shotguns are unpredictable but an m16 is an m16 and everybody has a chance.
2) Poor gunfights- A bit on loot tiers again but guns are unpredictable, only certain high tiered guns shoot straight barr some scoped weapons. There is really no skill when it comes to aiming. Ive seen people spam jump with a shotgun to make it harder to hit them and they suffer no accuracy penalties.
3) Building- Building... In a battle royale game... A large part of BR is positioning, game sense and tactics. Building a kickass fortress out of nothing just takes this away.

and yeah, thats it. As you can see I dont think much of the game. Do i suck at it? Probably, but I dont respect it much. I won my first fucking game... Yeah, i beat skilled players at the game with virtually no experience other than watchin some friends play and having the look of finding a high tiered scar. Got over 6 kills, won then played it a few more hours until, as I stated, certain things began to annoy me. Am I PUBG fanboy? No, I love how it has in a sense perfectly reflected what a BR game should be like but its Devs seem too lazy to fix issues like servers, performance and desync from high ping abusers.",FortNiteBR

I looted up, and boom, there were 15 people left. 

I killed two more, building cautious 1x1s as I moved into the storms, tearing down bases and maintaining the high ground. I jumped down as I saw the last guy, a bush wookie, half hiding in the storm, I shot with my SMG, ready to do damage, and then, just like that, my thumb slipped and I started choking my aim, aiming above his head. He lasered me. I died. I was his only kill of the game.

Let's get some invisibility in this game!

I assume the easiest way to implement invisibility in the game is by packaging it as a one time use consumable.  Here's what I was thinking...

Add it as a consumable that takes a long time to drink.  I think 10 seconds is a good place to start.

Then the player is invisible for 15 or 20 seconds.  During this time, the player is still susceptible to gunfire (which cancels invisibility effect) and will be unable to use weapons.  

In order to balance it properly, I suggest forcing the player into a visually ""bright"" vulnerable animation for 5 full seconds.  This vulnerable state should be able to be seen from a distance  but not loud.

I don't know.  Tell me what you think.  Can we get Epic to add this ability sooner rather than later?",FortNiteBR

I like spike traps but believe something needs to change; add a warning symbol/sound to alert players. Or reduce the damage taken so they can be used in a more skilful way, such as blocking an area so the opponent either destroys the trap (making noise and alerting you of their presence) or looses x amount of health.

I was trying to think of what could be done to help mitigate it some. Considering a headshot can be landed with the pump at a decent range, many are becoming skilled at the game and this is not as difficult for a lot of people.

Now hear me out. What if shotgun bloom was the same as it is in its current state while grounded, but when jumping it becomes much larger...not minimally.

I feel the reason they are so dominant in CQC is partly due to them being the single best guns to use while jumping with little to no repercussions. If we toned down their capabilities while jumping considering everyone jumps like a fucking kangaroo all the time, maybe there will be more balance?

TL;DR 

If we do something to slightly nerf shotguns while jumping, we might start to see some more play from other CQC  weapons creating more balance. When grounded shotguns would remain unchanged.",FortNiteBR

In our previous [state of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zke1s/state_of_the_subreddit_rules_discussion_edition/) (just under two weeks ago), we gave some stats about the subreddit.

We said

&gt;- Approximately 1500 new subs a day

&gt;- Approximately 2 million page views per day

&gt;- Approximately 15% of those views are unique


However, in the past 2 weeks, we're happy to share that we've been getting 


- Approximately 5,000 subscribers per day
- Approximately 3.5 million pageviews a day
- Approximately 450,000 unique pageviews a day
- Approximately 2,500 new posts per day

These numbers are astronomical, and as a result, we miss a lot of posts or don't get to them immediately (for example, there were hundreds of posts with that ""leaked skin"" aka Save the World character, and we couldn't keep up with all of them and remove them quickly). User reports are a huge help to us, so ***please*** keep them coming! Whenever you see a post or comment that you think breaks the rules, please use the report button. It takes 5 seconds for you, but it is a huge help to us in finding buried content that we probably would've missed.

To help alleviate the constant stress of a backed up unmoderated/modqueue, we will be choosing ~3 new moderators to be added to the team. Here are some things that we need from these new moderators:

- **HEAVY** focus on keeping unmoderated/modqueue and modmail **clean**
 - aka we need more help doing the repetitive and mundane modqueue
- We currently need more coverage in peak EU/Asia times, so being active at those times is a **big plus** to your application
 - Don't have to be an EU/Asian resident to be active during those times
 - Even if you're not active in EU/Asian times, please still apply

You can access the application at the link below: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqdw423dl7X44Y3N-V9J5ysVWdP75oqIMf_8iWhedKqPvzhA/viewform?usp=sf_link

Additionally, the survey results, rules update, and filter overhaul will be announced along with the new chosen mods, which should be within the next few weeks.

358,irr1449,1520449205,82qs1w,78,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/82qs1w/a_pubgers_guide_to_fortnite/,576,A PUBGers Guide to Fortnite,"I was a Fortnite hating PUBG player until about 2 weeks ago.  I have 500hrs into PUBG but got fed up with the hacking and lack of updates.  This is what I've learned in the 2 weeks that I hope can save some PUBG players some learning curve time.

Some of this might sound basic and obvious to Fortnite players but it should help those coming with a PUBG mindset. 

* Learn to use shotguns fast.  Fights are a lot closer range than PUBG.  The majority of your fights will be shotgun fights.

* Remap the building keys to your mouse buttons or other buttons that you can access while moving and fighting.  Build just for sake of building until you get the hang of it. 

* The default inventory key is (i) in FOrtnite.  Remap this to Tab and it will feel similar to PUBG.  Arranging the weapons in your inventory is important.  You want to try and keep your weapons in the same numbered spots.  IE: shotguns go in #1, AR's go in #2, etc.  You will need to switch weapons a LOT compared to Pubg.  It should become instinctive, ""I need a shotgun,"" press 2.  You don't want to be fumbling for weapons in combat. 

* Remap your pickax key to ""x"" or some other key.  Move all your weapon keys down one (IE: #2 remaps to #1).  You will be constantly changing back and forth to your pickax.  Removing it from the number keys prevents you from selecting it by accident in the middle of a hectic fire fight.  Nothing worse than trying to fire a gun and then realizing you have a pickax out.

* Don't freak out when you see other players.  You will often see players that are fairly close but out of the effective range of your AR or other guns.  In PUBG the first to see another players was most often the winner.  While Fortnite is similar, you have a much greater ability to fight back and win an engagement, even if the other player attacks you first. 

* Always carry a close range weapon (shotgun), mid range (AR/Burst AR), and long range (Scoped, Sniper, Crossbow).  Fortnite engagements are often won/lost based on using the right weapon for the engagement distance.  For example:  Someone with a shotgun will usually beat some with an AR in a close range fight.  If you get stuck in one of the final circles without long range, your probably going to get sniped.  In PUBG a lot of weapons (AR's, UMP) could be used at close and long range.  In Fortnite you need to have the right weapon for each range. 

* Don't go crazy trying to attack and build like some of the better players.  Building is going to take a lot of time to learn and master.  It doesn't translate from PUBG or any other games.  Keep building in safety until you master the controls.  Slowly introduce building into your combat as you feel ready.  Do not force yourself to build because others are doing so.  This will come in time.

* Forget everything you think you know about jumping out of the plane.  Because the Fortnite map is smaller you will almost always be landing near other players.  This means that getting to the ground first is EXTREMELY important.  Being the last to drop in even a semi-populated area, is a death sentence.  One of the most common things I hear when I get my PUBG friends to play Fortnite is, ""How do I get down faster.""  In PUBG you can control how fast you drop with the parachute.  The Fortnite gliders max drop speed is achieved by ""gliding.""  Where as in PUBG you might circle-drop over a target, in Fortnite this doesn't really work because you won't be dropping at the fastest rate possible.  You want to start gliding way before your target and time it so that you hit the ground right at you reach your target.  To practice this just land at Tilted Towers and experiment with timing your drops.  

* Your glider will open up at different altitudes depending on the terrain height below you. Think of it this way, the distance above ground that your glider deploys is static.  Try to drop over ""low elevation"" areas so that your glider will open later in your drop.

* Small shield potions can only get you to 50 shield.  Similar to how PUBG bandages only get you to 75% health.  

* Large shield potions can stack and get you to 100 shield.  If you feel safe, it is often helpful to wait on applying a large shield potion.  If you happen to find small potions later, you can boost over 50 shield.  

* Bandages work just like PUBG.  Med kits work just like Med Kids.

* Don't freak out if you can't find Epic/Rare weapons.  The difference in damage between weapon colors is not huge.  Don't drop your only long range for say a second shotgun because of the color.  Having the appropriate weapons for engagement distances is more important than having high tier weapons.

* Try to keep extra shield and health in your inventory.  When I first started I would be running around with 4-5 weapons and no health/shield.  It is not worth dropping bandages for a weapon just because it is a rare weapon.  

I hope this helps some PUBG people.  I will say that I'm having a lot of fun with Fortnite.  In my opinion the initial learning curve is much shorter in Fortnite.  My first PUBG chicken dinner took over 100 hours.  I was able to get one in Fortnite in only 10.  At the same time the skill ceiling in Fortnite is very high.  If you watch some streamers who play the game, you'll really appreciate the skill required in building.  

Please correct me if I posted anything that is factually inaccurate.  (Which is definitely possible!) ",FortNiteBR

Played it roughly 20+ times with only my friends as I cannot for the life of me find this game entertaining.

For starters, a lot of fanboys rabidly defend this game and it’s apparent “innovation”. Where has this game innovated in any aspect? It’s extremely simplistic, and to a degree the only thing making it unique is your ability to form building blocks during combat after mining, cough cough Minecraft. 

I do not understand what makes this game so popular. If someone can show me something I’m missing I’d appreciate that. And before anyone says “hey ur just bad lol get good” I’ve won a decent amount of the games I played. It’s painfully easy to get good at. 

I feel like this game is just a trend that’ll die out when the next triple A title comes out. Sorta like when all the youtubers were doing streams of DayZ, now they just do fortnite because it’ll get them views. ",FortNiteBR

Spread is fine! As long as spread isn't too big, you can make consistency with spread. Having pistols/smg have bigger spreads with less recoil while having assault rifles with more smaller spreads with stronger recoil. This would also make upgrades feel more like upgrades instead of just slight damage upgrades. I really wish epic would see this since they mentioned in their blog about the shooting model would consist of perfect accuracy + recoil which sounds like a nightmare to balance!

Back in early 2010, while slamming a few brewskis with the boys, we came up with an exciting concept using the Chinese cult film 'Battle Royale'. Filled with the passion and determination of any gamer, I set out to create a game on this idea. Since it took two weeks to devise the game idea, I called it 'Two Weeks'. 

I approached many a game developer but was shot down by each and everyone. However, when I approached a then little know Epic Games, they leapt at the chance of creating this game. While no official contract was devised, I had their word that I would be a project manager and help bring this revolutionary game to the masses. 

Yet, Epic Games and their k1ke lawyers stopped answering my calls. At the time, I figured they had simply abandoned the project. Recently, to my utter shock, I found they had gone and used my original idea for their personal and financial gain. The map is very similar to the one I had originally created. For example, if you look at Tilted Towers from the sky at a 36.5 degree angle, you will see my name (Marvin) appear on the buildings. 

While I am hurt that the guys at Epic Games would do me dirty like this, I hold no hard feelings. All that I ask is for some official recognition of my work. Even if this was to create a character model based on me, I'll attach an image of me with 1k upvotes. 

Anywho, feel free to ask more questions, I'll include my Patreon later if we get a bit of buzz going. #justiceformarvymarvin #bringbacktwoweeks",FortNiteBR

What existing emotes can we use as sign language?

I think the Positivity symbol [+] can be used for ""I need health""

Ammo requests can just be made by clicking an empty gun before them.

How do you tell them which direction an enemy is in and that you need help ambushing them?

I haven't played 50v50 and saw some videos on it. Definitely feel like communication should be a thing. Not vocal of course.

But if I'm standing in front of a teammate (have a tight limit for how far they can be) and:

1.I sent them a request to chat

2.They may accept

3.If they do, I get to send them two symbols (we'll have a couple of in-built symbols for this chat)

Me and my friend have come over to fortnite from pubg where we have about 120 hours each. Therefore we are no stranger to these kind of games but not experts either.

We played on the weekend the other night and won our very first duo game to our shock, we had the hang on the gunplay and we were able to duel relatively well and it felt very fun and fluid. 

However we have been on a serious downhill slope ever since then to  the point that last night we played about 15 games and got absolutely stomped in each and every one of them, whether it was expert architects that were able to build to Jesus and back or people running and gunning with a sniper we just got destroyed.

Therefore we have massively tilted and are back on pubg and we don't usually let difficulty of games stop us but it was just so frustrating to get eaten alive every game whilst reading ways to improve.

Is there any advice anyone can give? Have we been flagged since we won the first duo? Are we increasingly getting matched against much better players?

Thanks if you took the time to read =)",FortNiteBR

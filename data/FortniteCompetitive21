4,EnvoFN,1553452788,b4zrw7,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b4zrw7/the_competitive_state_of_the_game_right_now_is/,0,The competitive state of the game right now is absolutely appalling.,"There are a multitude of things/mechanics that are still in this game that, in all honesty, epic should be very ashamed of.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start off with stinks.

Why is this still an item, epic? I can carry up to 6 of them per stack, and each one can literally be thrown to put someone in the storm of the final circle, 10 damage per second. There is no counter-play whatsoever, you will be taking 5-15 damage at the minimum. What if I fight someone with 6 of them? Every time I attempt to push or box up and heal, I will be instantly thrown into a cloud of gas that hits for 10 hp per second. He could easily kill me with just his stinks alone, regardless of his skill. Let me say it again, absolutely no counter-play at all. Nothing that can be done to avoid the 5-15 damage (at least) every time a stink is thrown at me. That is an absolutely disgusting aspect of the game that really makes me lose faith in epic.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, snipers.

Sure they are fun for clips and stuff in casual play, but what am I supposed to do when I'm rotating mid game (in a scrim or a gauntlet) and I get sniped in the head? Just build? Sorry I don't have a reaction time of .01 seconds. Again, literally no counter-play. The anger any competitive player feels when the have a good loadout and a good position only to get head-sniped is very strong. I know recently a reddit post/comment was made from an epic employee talking about how they have no plans to remove/nerf the heavy sniper, let me ask, why?? Does it not appall you that there's a gun that can do at least 3/4 of your health from any distance, one shot you to the head from any distance, and break literally any wall? 

Let's put this into a scenario.

I'm set up in my turtle right before endgame and I'm edit-peeking out of my cone to stay aware of my surroundings. Little to my knowledge, there is a player holding his heavy sniper and crouch-walking up to my base from behind, using the foliage/bushes for cover. Suddenly, he presses left-click and is in my box. This happens in an instant, with no time for me to react. This surprise factor gives him a free pump shot to my head, killing me instantly. What am I supposed to do to counter that?? It is in no way a skilled play by him, just him abusing a weapon to kill me. Fun competitive experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Mobility.

From the blackheart cup yesterday, 7 of my 10 games ended near an enormous mountain (polar, lair mountain, viking, etc.) Many of these games, I have no rift-to-go's or launch pads. What do I do? 1500 mats is simply not enough to rotate up viking against enemy fire while the 10-tick zone is right behind me. Just because I'm simply not lucky enough to find a rift out of a chest (unlike my competitors) I can't successfully rotate up one of the largest mountains in the game, causing me to die? How is that in any way competitive? A man named DonnySC said that you (epic) should make the final zones stay more or less on the same horizontal plane, meaning the elevation of the ground level in zone won't change too much. This is an incredible idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Good ol' 'splodes.

I've seen PLENTY of twitter clips of people getting spammed by huge amounts of clingers, dynamite, rockets, and grenades. It is almost impossible to counter, as some nades will just slip through and hit you. Furthermore, if one person is sending loads of clingers your way, other people will begin to do the same, seeing as though you are in a very, very unfortunate situation, and they are hoping to pick up a quick and not very skillful kill. This kind of thing can absolutely ruin your game. I strongly think that 'splodes as a whole should be removed from the competitive side of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I'm gonna squeeze hamster balls and the point system into the same quick paragraph. 

The location of these hamster balls made me switch up my landing spot because of how necessary they are to place well endgame. That alone is bad for the competitive state of a game. Endgame without balls is very difficult for two reasons. One, rotating on foot without any source of consistent mobility is hard enough, but when you take into account the mats you use, the damage you might take, and the mountains you seemingly have to scale every circle, its almost impossible. Two, everyone that has a ball tends to stay alive for a very long time, making it harder to get placements points when you don't have a ball. Regarding the point system, 1 point for one kill compared to 10 points for a win incentivizes w keying way too much. The amount of 'braindead' players I had to fight int he blackheart cup was disgusting, and placement should be incentivized in a heavier manner for open tournaments. If you want to talk with me personally/have a civil debate about anything I said, hit me up on discord @ Envo#4907

I hope that i can summon the same energy and insights as the first time around.

&amp;nbsp;

As with my previous guide, I'll start with proof: https://i.imgur.com/l7j6bPm.png You may notice that I'm playing on my alt in some of these clips, so my stats will be lower if you look that character up. In my post about reaching a 7 day 52% solo win rate, I covered a few key points: Never take any fights, loot unpopulated areas, and hide as much as possible. I'd like to share a few more thoughts about maximizing this strategy. I'll also include some short clips that you can choose to watch or not. I was considering making a video tutorial, but I didn't want you guys to hit me with a tl;dw.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the most important aspects of this strategy is your loadout. I've stopped carrying meds altogether. If you execute this strategy properly, you won't be taking any damage, therefore you won't need to heal. My ideal loadout is pump shotgun, AR, stinks, stinks, and stinks. In this clip, I demonstrate how 3 stack of stinks can help you turn a bad situation around: https://youtu.be/f0hBLj98T0Y It's not easy finding 18 stinks, so there are some acceptable substitutions you can make. Dynamite, clingers, RPG, and boogie bombs all have excellent applications in a 1v1 situation against a weakened final player. Here is an example of a boogie bomb helping me triumph against a 6KD player: https://youtu.be/d0n8A3crmD4 I've won matches by carpeting over the final player who is out of mats and dropping a stack of dynamite into the tiny final circle without my opponent ever having an angle on me. Being able to go into the final fight with max mats while your opponent has 0 mats really puts the odds in your favor.

&amp;nbsp;

An important part of this strategy is understanding your goal and remaining calm. Ideally, you want the final fight to always be 2v1. In this match, my partner was yelling that we have to get out and fight, but I cautioned otherwise and told him we can dodge even if we don't have cover: https://youtu.be/fsl6p9u7ayA You can see that the aggressor dies because he was focused on passive players while the players with guns are focused on him. Here is an example of the evasive maneuvering you can do in a tight circle with many players: https://youtu.be/_j0WRXzxNKQ The ""never get out"" rule is not set in stone and there are times when you might determine that the final players are weak enough to engage. If you see the final two enemies fighting, they've traded shotgun blasts, and taken a few ticks of storm damage, it's a safe bet to apply pressure. If they shift their attention to you, don't be afraid to get back in the ball. Here is another example of how detrimental it is for an enemy to fixate on you: https://youtu.be/H5U5my6NIs4

&amp;nbsp;

If you are patient enough, your enemies will often outplay themselves. Here are two clips of easy wins because my opponents were too busy storm fighting each other on the ground while I grappled up a mountain: https://youtu.be/j7S9L1Mvv6w and https://youtu.be/rjyPXDkYCSc If you have high ground, you can drops bombs on their heads(remember you're carrying 3 stacks of explosives and your duo partner has another 3 stacks). If they take high ground, you can often shoot them out: https://youtu.be/5FmKmhN0hOc Remember, a win doesn't always have to be complicated, sometimes it's really this easy: https://youtu.be/vXlP3AyCI1E These may seem like simple tips, but there are often simple avenues to winning. You must utilize the baller to give yourself these windows of opportunity.

&amp;nbsp;

The greatest strength of duos is the amount of pressure you can apply together. A turret or two will often turn the tide of battle against a superior player. Here are two clips of players with 15 kills being defeated by a team with 0 kills: https://youtu.be/Aog98aQ3NYc and https://youtu.be/vxEGI_b4thw This is a perfect example of patiently waiting for the right opportunity to strike and hitting the enemy with your full force: https://youtu.be/-cLU77NxKnI The most difficult part of this strategy is finding a player that doesn't have ADHD because you're both going to spend a lot of time hiding together. Your opponents will often be going HAM for their 20 bomb Youtube videos, while you're tactically conserving all of your resources.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like to end this post with a couple longer clips (3-4 minutes) showcasing the full potential of the baller. I don't mind if you choose not to watch these, as I understand tl;dw. https://youtu.be/zoRuxHS7aNU and https://youtu.be/iPOTdFAHgUA",FortniteCompetitive

And they (streamers) respond: see what you did wrong in replay mode and what you could have done differentely, maybe check what your enemy did to kill you. ( Most of them say this). Also, you could watch those tips and tricks videos around Youtube and this sub reddit. And that it's correct.

But I like to think that it's not enough.

So yesterday, after finishing the blackheart EU qualifier for the finals(didn't qualify, 30 points) I went to watch POACH   
 stream of the blackheart qualifiers. It's always good to see pros playing the game and taking notes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, EVERY TIME you die WRITE(not digitally in your computer, I'm saying in a paper, there is a huge difference):

\-What you did wrong

\-What the enemy did to kill you

\-What you could've done different

Don't just think about it, if you write it, next time you will have a similar fight, your brain will tell you to not do what you did 4 games ago.

So now, watching videos and streams about new strats:

As I was saying while I was watching POACH stream yesterday, I noticed that he would make friends with a ball, then he ""betrayed the enemy"" throwing a boggie bomb at him and pump him for an EZ kill.

So I write it down. Even if it is pretty situational , write it anyways.

All of those tricks that you see whether be in this sub reddit or youtube vids, just write it.

Before you sleep read all those things you wrote in that day. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am not the best player so that's what I do to avoid mistakes and learn new strats, I reccomend this to everyone.

**Summary**

We will be adding gauntlet flairs in the coming weeks. The reason we are taking a while with this is that we want to make these pins have an incentive for the community; we want to create an icon that is different from the other pins to showcase and distinguish the Gauntlet Cup at a glace. Only points from the semi-finals and finals from both Gauntlet Cups will be added. Thank you for being patient if we haven't got to your request just yet!

**OR**

How often do you land on a roof of a house and someone lands on the floor. You get no chest or any weapons in the upstairs, but the enemy gets a pump and mini's? Even more often. 

Both incredibly tilting ways to die.

Epic Games Launcher privacy breaches accusations," I don't know if this has been posted here yet (Tried to post into main sub but ofc it's such a garbage it doesn't even show on new)

[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/epic-promises-to-fix-game-launcher-after-privacy-concerns/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/epic-promises-to-fix-game-launcher-after-privacy-concerns/)

Epic Games has been accused in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/) of privacy breaches in their launcher. The main concern at the moment is that it seems the launcher is gathering information of what Steam games you play through the function of connecting to your steam friends. Therefore a breach in the current GDPR law.

There's comments of actually programmers saying this is literally spyware. There's also others defending Epic and saying it's nothing invasive. Honestly don't know in what to believe but I'll still share the following:

Epic's CEO and Epic's VP of Engineering both have replied in this post. [CEO answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/eikbeya?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and [VP of Engineering answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/eijlbge/).

The VP of Engineering reply is honestly very weird (Keep in in mind EPIC is 40% owned by a Chinese company and there's allegations EPIC might be giving information to Chinese government which have their own dodgy privacy laws. Now take a look at the last line of this comment):

&gt;We use a tracking pixel (tracking.js) for our Support-A-Creator program so we can pay creators. We also track page statistics.  
The launcher sends a hardware survey (CPU, GPU, and the like) at a regular interval as outlined in our [privacy policy](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy)(see the “Information We Collect or Receive” section). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Runtime/HardwareSurvey/Private/HardwareSurveyModule.cpp).  
The UDP traffic highlighted in this post is a launcher feature for communication with the Unreal Editor. The source of the underlying system is available on [github](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Engine/Plugins/Messaging).  
The majority of the launcher UI is implemented using web technology that is being rendered by [Chromium](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) (which is open source). The root certificate and cookie access mentioned above is a result of normal web browser start up.  
The launcher scans your active processes to prevent updating games that are currently running. This information is not sent to Epic.  
We only import your Steam friends with your explicit permission. The launcher makes an encrypted local copy of your localconfig.vdf Steam file. However information from this file is only sent to Epic if you choose to import your Steam friends, and then only hashed ids of your friends are sent and no other information from the file.  
Epic is controlled by Tim Sweeney. We have lots of external shareholders, none of whom have access to customer data.  
Daniel Vogel  
VP of Engineering  
Epic Games Inc.

Which an user replied with:

&gt;Why are you doing this at all? Without explicit permission to do so which is clearly replicatable by following the smoke signals. My profile on Steam is set to private, yet you are snooping around my local disk scanning Steam and I've not even connected Steam to Epic. Using the unreal excuse is nice, I don't use it why are you doing it.  
You clearly aren't sending just friend list hashed because there is way more being lifted. You can't excuse this one on the basis of data collection because this isn't your application you are lifting from, especially when we haven't even allowed you to do so. This is straight up spyware shit and it's fucking disgusting.  
Also thanks for that weird as fuck last line. I'm glad to know it's just Tim goggling at my private data.

Also the VP of Engineering got 8 upvotes and was gilded 5 times?? (4 gold, 1 silver) This looks straight trying to manipulate opinion?

[Also this reply with literally a code showing your playtime in steam?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/eijrgsm?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) wtf

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bugs:**

The amount of bugs in the game is ridiculous, especially with the amount of money put on the line. During my time playing the blackheart tournament I have experienced numerous bugs and some that I've even died to. Some include: shotguns not shooting, hitmarkers/ghost shots, laggy servers, enemies walls appearing as your own, Ballers phasing through walls, and ballers randomly popping.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Heavy Sniper:**

In my opinion, the heavy sniper is absurdly broken. The fact that it can deal 150 to the body, which is already quite ridiculous for a BODY SHOT, and break any material in the game in one shot is broken. This weapon is basically a long range, higher damage, slower, pre-nerfed deagle. You can get wall replaces so easily with it, and sync shots with your teammate to pretty much KO anyone in a box standing still (happen in this cup as it was solo, just thought I'd point that out), which is the safest place you could be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Audio:**

For a competitive game, good audio is a must. You need to be able to hear where an enemy is clearly, and with pinpoint accuracy. This is something that you cannot do in Fortnite, a game with millions of dollars in potential competitive earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Shotguns:**

Shotguns are really inconsistent, and before you say its aim, its not. I've watched numerous clips going frame-by-frame to see exactly how many pellets hit and where. I've seen 3 pellet headshots deal more damage than 6 pellet headshots.

&amp;#x200B;

**Desync:**

The more I play, the more I realize how bad the desync is in this game. A number of times have I watched a clip back just to see that the enemy missed me, but actually had it register on the server. Just today, I was one pumped by a player who wasn't even looking at me when they fired their gun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Building:**

The .15s turbo-building delay is so horrible, I know they're working on a fix for it, but its just so horrible. Being shot through a wall that should have placed is the worst feeling. Recently, builds have also been seeming to go farther than usual, alot like how they were before the patch that (sort of) fixed it (not just my opinion, multiple others agreed from a previous post).

&amp;#x200B;

**Phasing:**

Phasing is something that has bothered me since the launch of this game. The fact that someone can have the tiniest bit of their head peeking through a foor/stair and still be able to shoot you back is really weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Zone started moving and my frames must of dropped below 15, I couldn’t aim properly my movement was horrible and this resulted in me dying and not picking any elims. Meanwhile there’s players in my lobby who are probably sitting above 80fps, now how the fuck I’m I supposed to compete with that whilst I’m struggling for 20? Don’t get me wrong I do believe controller players can definitely compete with mouse and key board, but console simply cannot compete with pc no matter how talented. I know it’s been mentioned a lot but the idea of separating console lobbies and pc lobbies in events is a fantastic idea. This gives talented console players a chance to make a name for themselves and get some form of recognition that they simply wouldn’t get by competing with players with better machines than there console. This would make the events completely fair in my opinion.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm writing this point to discuss how both of these modes can benefit from a second, smaller map that will be used exclusively for the latter game types. I'm going to break the post down in to blocks for each respective area that would benefit from this.



**ITEMS**

*What will change* - There are many items on the island that will never be used in an optimal loadout in competitive play, and essentially increase RNG on the initial drop. Such examples are pistols, infantry rifles, thermal, and a few others. On an exclusive island these items can be completely removed and new items will only be added once amply played with on the regular item. Aside from inventory items, movement options and vehicles can be changed or removed, as they would be less necessary on a smaller island. I am by no means saying rid of rifts to go and launch pads; those are 100% necessary on late game rotations. But this is rather addressed towards vehicles such as planes and ballers that have no business being in competitive playing and turning the game in to super monkey ball, but are very fun to use in public games.
*Why this is helpful* - It will reduce the moments of early game drops, looting a whole house, and having absolute crap, and the guy in the next house over gets shields, a shotgun, and smg despite his house having less spawn points or the ""if only that gun spawn I ran over wasn't an infantry rifle"" moments. This will rid the island of useless items that reduce useful items' spawn rates, but on the other side of the coin will allow those who wish to play with overpowered items for fun can do so on the main non-ranked island. In pubs the baller is a super fun item, is by no means overpowered, and it's a shame that competitive play leads to these weird spawn rate nerfs, and will most likely lead to further nerfs to the ball because of how ridiculous it can be in comp.
*Counter Argument* - My other points have counter arguments so I have this section, but not really sure what can be said about this one other than ""jUsT aDapT""



**Game Population**

*What will change* - The map will be smaller and will be designed for say 50-80 people. Queue times will be reduced drastically, and it will be far more likely to match with people of similar points or rank. Matchmaking will be far less impacted by point distribution and game population.
*Why this is helpful* - Queue times would be far less for those with high points, and those with low points won't be matched with those much further ahead of them. You can also argue that if the game is drastically different and new comp only mechanic is added, it may draw those who don't typically play gauntlet in to the playlist to try something new, increasing the overall population of the playlist. (no definitive proof of this last point, but it's something to consider)
*Counter Argument* - More people is more fun! Also in professional tournaments there will be more heats and less of our favorite pros will be playing in the same game together at once.




**END GAME**

*What will change* - As I said earlier, this map will be smaller, and will have a significant drop in the max number of players, say 50-80. This will reduce the number of people who make it to endgame, and will also require less time to get there.
*Why this is helpful* - Once you get to higher point gauntlet the end game runs like a powerpoint slideshow compared to public games. The map will have less people, and therefore endgame will run a little smoother. The island will also be smaller, and there will be less things to load on to the server overall, which will put less strain on the way the game runs as well. Changing the game is far more achievable than magically fixing the servers to account for an extremely resource heavy game that has 100 people connected to a server, and where the map dynamically changes drastically because of building. Also with there being less people end game will come sooner, and those games where you farm up just to get in an awkward build fight because someone W keys you for no reason and you all die to storm, die to a third party, or lose all you mats/healing won't be as tilting or frequent because mid game (and the game overall) will be shorter. In general, less people = less RNG. It's why march madness is madness when there are 64 teams.
*Counter Argument* - Again, one can argue more people = more fun, and sometimes the fun of end game is the chaos, and less people in the game will tone that down some. Some will argue they should work on server performance (~1 billion times easier said than done) rather than circumvent that by just having less people.



**Exclusive Game Mechanics**

*What will Change* - Good question! I don't know... But certain mechanics like health on kill were first implemented in, and were exclusive to comp, and this will be an area where core game mechanics can differ from the main game. Something such as a respawn van can be trialed in the public game modes before going to comp, as it would definitely change the comp game. One thing I personally would like to see is if the material cap could be bumped a little, and I'm sure many of you have great ideas of mechanics that will be great just for comp.
*Why this is helpful* - Pubs play differently from competitive games, game mechanics should reflect that. Shield on kill, new things like storm surge can be tried out, etc. Personally I think a mat increase would be helpful as my partner and I find ourselves running out of mats more and more despite every midgame box up we have we post up on a material source and build out of said material source to stay at 1500 total mats apiece. Too much expenditure of mats when you need to rotate without a rift or launch pad. But I can see the other side of the argument, and this is a discussion for another post. But my point is that a change such as a material cap increase can benefit comp, but there is no need to change it in pubs as it helps players who don't want to spend 10+ minutes farming just to die. And there is also no need to have over 1500 mats in a public game with all of 10 people being there as the third circle is coming in.
*Counter Argument* - None really, because if something works in both game types it will be in both, and if it works in one, but not the other that can be achieved as well. This is more or less accomplished in pop up cups in general, but can be further pushed with having a new island. So I guess ""jUsT aDapT"" again?

They already changes ADS/Aim assist in patch 5.30 (or maybe 4.30 I don't remember)

But it just feels very awkward, especially at long distances with an AR, it just doesn't feel like it even locks on at all sometimes, or if I'm shooting one enemy and want to take shots at another, it feels nonexistent.

I guess maybe they nerfed it because of a lot of people calling for a change to L2 spam, which is why controller/console needs to just be separated in tourneys and stuff, console/controller just is not meant to keep up with PC.

I wish EPIC would just revert sensitives (X'Y and ADS) to the state they were in older seasons and separate console and PC in tournaments, but I know that is never gonna happen.

The game in general just feels really clunky.

I come from a background in MOBA games, starting with HoN and then transitioning to LoL in 2012. For 2 years I spent my time stuck in what I believed to be ""Elo Hell"" and was in a constant state of bitterness and negativity surrounding my improvement. I hovered around the mid-Silver level and occasionally dipped up into Gold only to return to Silver after a bad losing streak. Around the time that Season 2 was coming to a close I decided to pick up Rumble as my go-to Top Laner and played him exclusively for the better part of 2013. I devoted an incredible amount of time to learning the ins and outs of itemization, stat optimization, and matchups for this one champion. What I found was that by reducing the amount of conscious thinking that I needed to do during matches by pouring countless hours into learning the options for item builds and matchups I could focus my entire attention on executing. By staying in the moment and allowing my sub-conscious actions to take over while playing it allowed my conscious thoughts to veer towards thinking creatively and anticipating opponent behavior. In Season 4 I practiced this methodology and enjoyed watching my teammates complain about a Silver-Bordered player on their team in Challenger matches. By applying this same methodology to Fortnite I have found equal levels of success in picking up and mastering a game from a completely different genre from the one that I'm comfortable in. The following steps are a part of an unwritten process that I have been subscribing to for a few years and I have been able to achieve great success across a variety of games while having this mindset.*

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Repetition to Sub-Conscious**

Most of us don't think about each individual key press while doing 90s in games, its just muscle memory. This process of committing a technique to muscle memory needs to be done for each regular and irregular build pattern that we plan on using in game. To minimize any conscious thought about movement or mechanics is essential to being able to tap into our ability to think calmly and creatively in high-pressure environments. Some examples of patterns to commit to muscle memory:

* Right 90s
* Left 90s
* Self Cone/Floor
* Double Ramp Cone
* Cone Jump into Double Ramp
* Cone + Ramp Jump
* 1x1 Turtle
* 2x2 Turtle
* Straight Tunnel
* Bizzle Tunnels
* Thwifo Cone
* Ramp/Floor Edit Down
* Ramp/Wall Edit Forward
* Tfue Floor Shot

&amp;#x200B;

The above list is not comprehensive, but is a good example of items that should not require any conscious thought while performing. These builds should be reactionary when you imagining the desired outcome. For example if you decide to do a cone jump as a reaction to an enemy blocking your ramp you would already be thinking about the subsequent retake method after completing the cone jump rather than worrying about jumping at the right time and pressing the correct keys.

	

**2) Silencing of Self-Judgement**

This is an often overlooked point in the improvement process. When we inevitably make a mistake our conscious mind will criticize our actions and become more aware of the patterns that we have committed to muscle memory. When our conscious mind takes over in this way we change the pattern in question from being automatic and sub-conscious to manual and labored, causing our performance to tank. Instead we must acknowledge the mistake objectively and unemotionally, and reimagine the result while continuing to allow our sub-conscious to control the muscle memory of the pattern. It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in the sense that by thinking about the action you're trying to not mess up you end up having a much greater chance of messing up said action. The same can be said about succeeding and performing well. When you're dominating in a match and exceeding expectations you've set for yourself, you may wonder what you're doing differently to achieve such great results. The moment your conscious mind adds this positive judgement to your actions your performance is almost guaranteed to decline. The process for quieting the mind and staying in a calm and focused state is one that must be learned gradually by recognizing when emotions are being drawn into your play. When we recognize that we're being emotional or judgmental of ourselves we must acknowledge that this behavior is occurring and allow our focus to drift elsewhere, similar to techniques used when meditating to acknowledge that our minds are drifting and to veer to stay on course.

	

**3) Reaching the Flow State**

The ultimate result of this process of muscle memory building and silencing our conscious judgement results in achieving what is known as a flow state, which is described frequently by members of the rock climbing community as an optimal mental state that produces performance, creativity, decision-making and innovation. You have almost certainly experienced this state before, having games where you feel unstoppable and constantly one step ahead of enemies. This state is achieved by giving complete trust to your sub-conscious to perform activities related to muscle memory and movement, making room for your mind to think creatively and strategically about the task at hand. Playing within this state is a near-necessity in high level end game scenarios. There isn't any time to tense up and think about mechanics in the final minutes of a match during moving zones. A great tip from the book The Inner Game of Tennis is to think about the image of your desired outcome in situations where you are having difficulty silencing your conscious mind so that your sub-conscious can take over the muscle memory that you shouldn't be focusing on.

I've been PC gaming for about 10 years. I'm an ex R1 wow player and I typically played FPS on console until Overwatch &amp; Fortnite were released.

I have been playing Fortnite at 800 DPI with my X&amp;Y at 0.075. I would consider this Wrist aiming. Would you all agree?

Also, I have been going back and forth between sensitivities trying to find the perfect sens and it isn't easy tbh.

Maybe that's because I switch it up too often..

At a lower sensitivity I find it a lot easier to hit shotgun shots, but the downside is building/edits and close up 180 shotgun shots are harder. At 0.075 I tend to over compensate a lot when aligning shots but my quick builds and edits are great.

Would would you all suggest.. Sticking with 0.075 and slowly adjusting my sensitivity down or start low and adjust up?

Again, what do you all think the middle ground sens is between wrist and aim?

Almost 3 weeks into the M&amp;KB switch. I've improved a ton already, but I'm having a problem with my weapon slots. I always fuck those up and it makes me choke so hard to often. I hate the numbers, so I have C, V and B for slots 1, 2 and 3 (usually pump, SMG, AR) but it's just not optimal. I gave it over 2 weeks to get used to, but it still just feels uncomfortable and I still choke so often. C for my shotty feels good, it's an easy to reach slot and I have the muscle memory down. But V and B are annoying to reach, I accidently press C or B when I wanted to press V, sometimes I accidently press space bar, etc. Should I reconsider using the numbers, or should I change up something else? Currently I'm not using shift, so I was thinking about moving edit to shift which clears up F for an easy to reach slot (SMG/ pump follow-up), and I was thinking about moving cone to X (which I'm currently not using) which would clear up a mouse side button for my AR slot. Would this be decent? Any other recommendations? Currently I have wall on Q, ramp on E, floor and cone on mouse side buttons, edit on F, reload on R, crouch on caps, inventory on tab, pickaxe on G, edit on F, slots on C,V,B, 4 and 5.",FortniteCompetitive

Obviously boxing up is a very strong defensive tactic but by doing so you let the aggressor dictate the pace of the fight. So what I’ve noticed is you have to play faster, don’t let them dictate the pace of the fight by playing passive the only way to deal with these people is use mobility to get out of there which could be saved for end game and also risk them following you or trying to return the aggression.

Putting your reset on the same button as your edit button (unless your edit is on a thumbstick) has a few noticeable pros. First and most obvious, you don't have to take your finger off of your edit button so it's fast and the most simplified it can be. The second advantage is that a lot of other reset binds coincide with other buttons and can cause something to perform an unwanted action if you mispress a button.

Not only did I hold top 3% for 3 days running up to the Scallywag Cup, I also moved to top 1% on Friday (\~43+  points was top 1%, and in the picture below, I was at 47 points, which is where I stopped before the deadline).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img bklwyzcpajn21...*

However, on Saturday, the day of the Gauntlet cup, the cup was locked with absolutely no explanation besides ""you are ineligible for this cup."" My teammate, who I was planning on playing the cup with, had the exact same problem, AND he was top 2% before the deadline.

According to Thanos (yes, that's his real  name...sus, I know) the reason I wasn't allowed to participate in the  event was because...wait for it...I ""MAY HAVE NOT BEEN ELIGIBLE.""  Real helpful. Great information. Much knowledge. This explains absolutely  NOTHING!

Thanos goes on to say ""what  I'd recommend is that you keep an eye out in the Events tab in-game so that you will not miss out on any other upcoming events you can take  part in, and in the future, possibly participate in the final event of  another cup or tournament.""

This  literally means nothing. ""Keep an eye out in the Events tab?"" Is that what would make me eligible? Even if I were to take that seriously, it's not like I hadn't touched the Events tab. I had repeatedly visited the events tab, inspected the Scallywag Cup (as evidenced by the second  screenshot in this post), looked at event leaderboards, etc. Epic just straight up didn't give me an explanation for why this happened.

This makes the game even more inconsistent. If everyone is abusing an item such as ballers the fix shouldn't be to lower the spawn rate, this just makes you more desperate for the item, and possibly even forcing you to take an early fight just for a baller. Some of you may disagree, saying that the less common the item the less likely it will interfere in your game, while that is a valid point, it just makes the person with said item at an even greater advantage. Imagine you were in a endgame circle and only you had a baller, everyone is to worried about who might shoot them while they are rotating or perhaps looking for pick, no matter what, the very last thing a smart player will do is spray a ball for 300 dmg in front of multiple enemies, and a 10 ticking storm, that likely has a player at max mats and full shields. Instead of just making an item more rng by reducing its spawn rate and giving a few players a golden ticket to top 12, lets remove the ball from comp que altogether or nerf it in a way that doesn't give it such an advantage.

I currently play on the xbox one x, and primarily play duos with my bud. We are highly competitive and console pubs are pretty much a joke, (we have 4.5 kd with a 25/30% win rate over the past two seasons, i only mention this to establish im not some whiney console noob) so we enjoy competing in the tournaments for the extra challenges and “sbmm”. Constantly, consoles limitations show, as pc players have the ability to do much more.


*Some simple things pc players can do that console can not*

1) custom res

2) turn off shadows. (Shadows on the xbox one x are so dark i cant see A THING indoors especially at night)

3)much much higher fps, console rarely ever reaches 60fps.

4) on pc, jumping and aiming simultaneously is natural. On console, you cant do both at the same time.  (This also applies to building. If you are shot in the back, you can jump, twist and build in an instant. Not happening that quick on console, and can be the dif between taking one shot and getting knocked)

5)even with elite controllers/paddles, i can jump and aim at the same time, but there is no ADS in the air, and therefore no aim assist.

6) pc can instantly switch to any weapon slot. Console has to toggle through, limiting extremely quick switching to a variety of weapons/items during a fight.

7)end game. Once we get up to 30ish points in the tourneys, end game the xbox about explodes and drops to less than ten frames. Making it impossible to do anything.

8) edits are much smoother and consistent on pc. The limited button mapping on console and inability to flick seamlessly on console prevents the crazy edits that occur regularly on pc.


Im aware some low end pcs can face some of these issues, but i didnt choose to play on pc, i am a console player. Yes, PC is the true place to be if you want to be serious at the game, but im not making the switch and spending hundreds for one game. Id love to face other players in the same position as me and see where i stand. Saying pc and console is a level playing field is like saying mobile should play with console players because equal.

Learning pc is much much harder than console, and the elite pc players out there deserve credit for the work they put in. That being said, in a game with such an extreme skill gap, it becomes tiresome to be forced to play against people where i am constantly at a disadvantage.  i dont see any downside for having separate pop up cups. They dont need to have prizes or tourney invites available either, just for us to have an idea of where we stand.

But the casuals they love these things and would flame epic if they removed it. The casuals think it is a fun item and they play for fun. Once it gets vaulted the casuals would say «another great item removed by the competitive community». 

So epic you should balance the competitive and casual side separately. In all pop ups like gauntlet, scallywag, blackheart the baller should be removed. And in regular gamemodes the baller should stay. You would not hear stuff like «epic is catering to casuals» or «epic is catering to competitive players».

I am not talking about zone locations and I am not talking about the loot pool.  These are both normal factors of a BR game.

Im talking about phasing, packet loss, micro stutters, weapons not shooting, blank hitmarkers (even when there is no build being placed) and inconsistent shotgun damage.  

&amp;#x200B;

Phasing: The biggest issue with phasing in my opinion is the inconsistency of it.  There have been so many times where im holding a guy out that is spraying an SMG/AR into my build and next thing i know he slides right in.  This creates an unexpected action.  If it was a known case that a person walking into and spraying a weapon at your build will result in phasing then players can play around that and be more prepared for when it happens, rather then being surprised.  This also applies to phasing through your own builds.

&amp;#x200B;

Packet Loss: This is an issue that many attributes to blank hit markers and pumps not shooting.  Regardless, there is an issue with the server that is causing data to be lost causing game breaking errors in gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

Micro stutters: I mean, do I need to really explain this one? Random stutters can contribute to random jump fatigue if it occurs while jumping.  People falling off builds, moving out of cover, missing key shots on an opponent.  Again, with no way to predict when it is going to happen.  Not saying it should be a predictable part of the game, but it increases the negative impact of these stutters.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons not shooting/blank hitmarkers:  How many times have you went to hit that perfect head shot with your shotgun and.....nothing. You expect to shoot, switch to your secondary but then your surprised because your shotgun never shot and now your whole flow is just thrown off.  Blank hit markers on a guy flying through the air? cant even argue that the ping has anything to do with that with how it does when an opponent builds a wall as you shoot him.  Needs to be fixed.  Also, shotgun damage seems very inconsistent.  How can i hot a guy in pre game lobby that is not moving, without moving my cursor, for different damages? 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, we need epic to look at the performance and gameplay of fortnite before we get new items in the game.

I don't think that you should get the same amount of resources that it took to build that structure, for instance getting 5 or more of that material type for each wall fully destroyed.

**SKILL BASED MATCH MAKING:** At this point in time, their is a big skill gap between the community, when ever I go against anyone, they are ether someone who has no idea what they are doing, or a streamer, thinking they are the next Tfue, and are getting signed to Faze. You get the point, it's not fun ether destroying, or getting destroyed every time you play. every game, you should be put against people who have the same K/D as you, therefore, everyone having in the match having around the same skill as you.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**VAULT AND WEAPON OPTIONS:** IMO, their is way to many weapons and items that I will never pick up. Half of them are useless, and just not powerful enough, or useful.

Vaults:

Tactical shotgun: Who uses this endgame?

Silenced scar: Not good enough compared to the AK or regular scar.

Silenced Sniper: Bolt and Heavy are better options.

Scoped assault rifle: snipers are better options and it's never used.

Thermal assault rifle: same reason as the scoped assault rifle.

Rocket Launcher: If you have this, you have a advantage that is too big.

P90: Getting old, and suppressed SMG is better 

Scoped Revolver: Not worth one of my weapon slots.

Bush: I know it's a Fortnite staple, but, who bush camps anymore?

Turret: no one likes it, not worth the legendary rarity, plus it's really easy to get sniped in it.

Mini gun: OP as heck, if your low, and have little to no mats, say good bye to your life.

Pump (Blue and Green:) replace with heavy.

Dual Pistols: SMG's are a better option

Suppressed pistol: Not the best, only time you use it is when you don't have an AR.

Infiltry rifle: Worst gun ever put into the game.

Baller: Just annoying, really annoying.

Pistol: Early game gun that gets replaced the second you find any other gun.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Unvaults/New stuff I want**

Heavy Shotgun: Replace it with the green and blue pumps. Make it green and blue.

Grappler: Really fun to use and good in general.

Shockwave grenade: Great for movement, and fun like the grappler.

Zapatron: only a few people have tried it, it would be fun to some how reintroduce it into the game.

Smoke grenades: useful for getting out of build fights, and confusing the opponent.

Tactical SMG: Balanced, and to add another SMG option to the game.

Bouncer: this was probably one of the best items they have ever added in the game.

Double barrel: Tone it down to make it a grey weapon. 80/135 damage.

Bolt action: It was really good, better than the silenced sniper and heavy IMO.

(New)Uzi: Epic:18 Legendary:20. Extremely high fire rate. DPS:230. Replaces the P90

(New)Molotov cocktail: Slowly burns the player, Epic rarity, lasts 3 seconds, 12DPS. Burns down wood and makes metal weaker.

(New)Speed potion: makes you run 2x faster, lasts 15 seconds, blue rarity.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Competitive Game Mode:** 

On Twitter, Fortnite should make a straw poll, and let the community, decide what weapons, features, and map they would want in this game mode. It would make the community happy, and not complain as much.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Team Based PVP.**

Add a team based PVP mode, everyone get's to pick what guns go into their inventory. Some game modes would be.

Capture the Flag

TDM

FFA

Domination

Kill confirmed.

https://i.redd.it/gb8ky6chjdn21.png

Basically If they add a field of view slider it should set the diagonal field of view and should preserve the diagonal fov when changing aspect ratios.

Currently when you change aspect ratio away from 16:9 you always get additional fov. So when you play at 1:1 it preservers the horizontal fov and increases the vertical fov. When you play 21:9 it preserves the vertical fov and increases the horizontal fov. So pretty much if you are playing at the default aspect ratio most monitors use you are always at a disadvantage.

|Aspect Ratio|Horizontal FOV|Vertical FOV|
|:-|:-|:-|
|16:9|80|50.53|
|1:1|80|80|
|21:9|95.52|50.53|
|4:3|80|64.37|
|9:16 (Monitor flipped vertically)\*|80\*|112.33\*|

If the Field of View was preserved diagonally across different aspect ratios the horizontal and vertical field of views balance themselves out much better than what fortnite currently has. With Dfov preserved if you change the aspect ratio away from 16:9 the narrower you make the aspect ratio you will lose hfov but gain some vfov. If you make it wider you gain more hfov but lose vfov. Main thing is that diagonal fov is still preserved so even if you use some crazy aspect ratio like 9:16 where you flip your monitor vertically the hfov and vfov just flip.

&amp;#x200B;

Here list of hfov and vfov at different aspect ratios when dfov is capped at 110.

|Aspect Ratio|Horizontal FOV|Vertical FOV|Diagonal FOV|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|16:9|102.4|70|110|
|9:16 (Monitor flipped)\*|70\*|102.4\*|110\*|
|1:1|90.6|90.6|110|
|4:3|97.6|81.2|110|
|21:9|105.4|58.7|110|
|32:9|107.9|42.25|110|

Theres a bigger list of values on this blog so you can see fov values at different aspect ratios.

[https://vrguy.blogspot.com/2013/04/converting-diagonal-field-of-view-and.html](https://vrguy.blogspot.com/2013/04/converting-diagonal-field-of-view-and.html)

&amp;#x200B;

So if they add a fov slider it should set the diagonal fov and they can set the range from 90 Dfov to 140 Dfov or whatever they want.

110 Dfov gives you closest hfov value to overwatch at 16:9.

90 Dfov gives you closest hfov value to fortnite at 16:9.",FortniteCompetitive

Soon I’ll be getting a Pc, to try and progess competitive due to me playing on the Xbox.
I come from a cod background having little experience on kbm. 
On controller I have about a 5 kd with like a 20%wr (to me stats don’t mean anything) 
I do the pop up cups and I do good enough. I get through the rounds etc but as the games get better and more people survive my Xbox starts to crash and basically I’m looking at a photo. 
I got around 22 points in wr qualifiers and have been doing scrims since May of last year.
When I get my pc would you recommend I switch to kbm or stick with controller? ( I’m a quick learner when it comes to games and I’m in that category of professing quickly like majority of us here. But I’ve had no experience apart from playing dota 🥴 and runescape. Which are not shooters.

Currently you can land on a scoped pistol, scoped AR, hunting rifle, infantry rifle, white/green pistol, just ammo or even a blank floor loot. As for shotguns, white tac is still in the game despite there being a clear consensus that it simply can’t compete with the pump or the heavy pump.

Some items should simply be vaulted from competitive playlists. Yes, RNG is part of the game, however it can still be controlled enough to reward high skill more consistently.

Some ways to improve the game competitively:

-no floor loot should be empty

-no more just ammo floor spawns (increase ammo from ammo crates)

-remove white tac shotgun variant

-remove 2-3 out of the following: hunting rifle, scoped AR, scoped pistol, pistol, infantry rifle

-increase shotgun drop rate ",FortniteCompetitive

Nothing about what del said was the truth. He literally stated aipha was never considered to be a part of TSM.

Note that I love tsm but honestly they can't hear themselves right now. 

Aipha would have been the 3rd/4th best player in tsm after Zex and Vinny had he been signed. He consistently places high in pro scrims and pop ups. Also places higher than myth in tourneys. 

Decent player indicates that myth is calling aipha an average player which he's not. An average pro? Maybe. 

All myth had to say was that the truth hurts. He also said ""so it's not professional to have an opinion?""

Yes, it's not professional to have downgrade and straight up disrespect a player like aipha. 

The truth hurts? Well I'm gonna state facts that might hurt some here - 

1) Aipha is better than Myth and half the tsm roster 
2) Myth isn't even a good competitive player anymore, poor decision making 
3) Leena might be a great person but isn't being professional. 
4) Don't get me started on Dellzor lmao 
5) Myth is the biggest competitive joke after hamster balls 
6) Vinny and Zex (And Kaysid) are the only good comp players on tsm. 
7) Aipha is better than the entire tsm Jr roster. Including cloud and commandment. 
8) Myth doesn't even take the game seriously anymore. Memes every fight, does poorly in solos. Hopes to get carried in duos. 
9) Not apologising for being unprofessional is just more unprofessional. 
10) If aipha is decent, the whole tsm roster is below average. (Except new signings). 

Don't give hate to any of these guys, all great people. Myth just made a poor argument protecting tsm when he should have apologised on the teams behalf. Tsm don't know how to handle this. Could've just said ""Sorry, Aipha is an amazing player but yet to prove himself. If he keeps grinding, he'd be on our roster for sure."" which is much more the truth than ""Aipha is a decent player or not a beast player"" 

Sorry, The Truth Hurts.

&amp;#x200B;

We all have seen the tweets, posts, etc asking about the performance of the game, esp in late game competitive situations. It's been noted by console and PC players alike for weeks now. I think everyone is correct in wanting some form of communication on this issue from Epic, but lets look at it from another angle. There is no other multiplayer or BR game out there that has as much going on late game as Fortnite. 40+ players moving, shooting, building, editing, healing, etc. And because they're all in close proximity to one another, all of that information needs to be rendered and communicated to the server for every single player left alive. It's not a huge issue early game, as the game doesn't need to render what's going on in Pleasant if I'm in Retail. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we've all seen examples of streamers' games struggling to push even 60 frames per second late game with 2080tis and 9900ks and custom graphics settings. Now if you look at a stock PS4's specs, it's pretty amazing the game even runs late game considering all you have an almost 6 year old machine with a 1.8 ghz cpu, RX480 level gpu performance, 8 gigs of RAM, no custom graphics setting(shadows, view distance, etc), plus the game is stored on an old SATA II HDD. Couple those specs with whatever background processing power is needed to run the PS OS. And before anyone comments, well I have a PS4 pro or XBox 1X! You're look at a slight upgrade to RX580ish graphics performance and a step up to 2.1-2.3 ghz in the cpu, which is about a 17% jump. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you really think about it, it's pretty incredible they've been able to squeeze that much performance out of these consoles given the raw processing power they have. I didn't make this post to excuse Epic, I think the performance of the game does need to be boosted, but the fix is insanely complex since it most likely requires updating the game engine itself. I don't think Epic ever envisioned their game would be played like it is (at least in the competitive scene), and they don't have a magic wand to make the game run better. ",FortniteCompetitive

Might be a good addition or not, but apart from that I think this is a missed oppurtunity to finally get rid of some of the shitty weapons. We have literally 6 types of pistols right now:

\- Regular pistol (common/uncommon, floor loot only)

\- Silenced pistol (uncommon/rare, floor loot + chests)

\- Dual pistol (rare/epic, floor loot + chests)

\- Hand cannon (epic/legendary, floor loot + chests + supply drops)

\- Scoped revolver (epic/legendary, floor loot + chests + supply drops)

\- Knock-back pistol (common/uncommon, floor loot only)

That's just to much. With the knock-back pistol being common/uncommon, the chances of finding a shotgun as floor lote have decreased even more. We only have two types of shotguns, from which only one is useful. In addition to that, we still have materials and ammo as floor loot. 

I think this is a missed opportunity to at least get rid of some of the shitty weapons. What's the point of having both silenced and regular pistols, and in which scenario is the scoped revolver a viable option? Nothing is more disappointing than getting one of those out of a supply drop which you've been contested for.

Also, turrets are still in the game despite literally nobody using them and everyone dropping them out of their inventory. The increased harvesting rate is fantastic but makes materials as floor loot completely useless and we can get rid of ammo as floor loot by slightly buffing ammo chests. 

So much RNG that can be solved by a few very subtle changes. ",FortniteCompetitive

They're low risk vs a high reward: easy rotations, protection, save mats. When adding new items epic should ensure there be obvious risks using an item/vehicle that come close to matching the reward for their use. Epic seems intent on continuing to add mobility items, so simply vaulting isn't a solution.

I wanted to take the time to share my thoughts on vehicles in fortnite, gauge the communities thoughts , and offer some analysis as to what makes certain vehicles balanced/how to go about balancing them. 

To me vehicles, and mobility in general, seem to be the new norm in Fortnite (here on referred to as FN). Epic seems intent on introducing new ways to get around, and we've seen the various forms of mobility grow increasingly sophisticated over the seasons. To date we've had: impulse grenades, shockwave grenades, jetpacks, shopping carts, golf carts, atks, port-a-rifts, rifts, bounce pads, jump pads, redeploy, atks, planes, ballers, hoverboards, zipline, thermal vents, cannons, and grapplers (forgive me if I missed something). 

All the mobility items have had their own strengths, weaknesses and levels of viability. Now let us turn our focus towards the generally most agreed upon problem items and why they were viewed as such; while noting that this will mainly be with an eye towards competitive play. 

Jet packs-sort of their own category, in that they were never prominent in competitive play, but general issues were that enabled player to build minimally while gaining high ground on a player, and retake high ground with relative ease. 

Bouncers, grapplers, port a rift, jump pads- I lump these three together in that much of the complaints around them were because of the RNG of getting said items, and the advantage provided to players with them vs those without. It is worth noting that generally these items were not viewed as a particular problem in themselves, with perhaps the grappler being the exception, and most complaints were largely around availability (I am not stating that as dogma or that the scope was limited to just that, just making some generalizations in order to limit length).

Planes, ballers-this grouping is its own, and while they share similarities, they both achieve much of the same power in distinct ways. Initial planes had no hp loss on destruction, bowled through builds, had increased hp, and 100% spawn rate. After rounds of nerfs we ended with 50hp damage on destruction, 50% spawn rate, ""inability"" to go through structures, and increased damage upon collisions. Even with the nerfs planes remained a staple in competitive play. Much of the strength of planes both pre and post nerf though came from their ability to allow the player to move with relative safety, quickly, with precision, to conserve materials, and that generally late game focus firing a plane rather than another player on the ground simply didnt provide enough payoff for various reasons. We are seeing those similar attributes now with the introduction of the ballers. 

Generally speaking the power of this last group are truly on their own. All the actual vehicles in the game have always had some built in aspects that limited their power. Shopping carts were only ever used competitively to get in from early zones so can be ignored. Golf carts were limited in speed, the terrain they could traverse, and offered little in the way of protection from enemies. Atks are still competitive and are used for long early rotations and, though less often, for 3rd and later circles as well. Atks however are limited by: limited protection, dont move fast enough to avoid fire/escape unless used for flying, and offering little control over micro adjustments to flightpath and landing. Like the other vehicles, ballers and planes also dodged one of the larger weaknesses of grapplers and rifts in that they dont take up an item slot. 

So the advantages that we can say separate these vehicles are: speed, precision movement (more so ballers), ability to cover any terrain, protection, and opportunity cost for enemies to attack you vs non vehicle using players. Throw in the added strength that the baller allows for players to shift much easier from piloting to fighting because of their ability to fit nicely inside a 1x1 and are then ready to be taken out to rotate again at a moments notice.

What we end up with are two in game items that offer enormous upside, with minimal downside. Epic needs to begin by thinking about these different dynamics before inserting new items like this to the game. 

If they are intent on keeping vehicles in game, they need to begin by there being less apparent upside and making rotating without a vehicle have a closer actual value than it currently does. Some proposed ideas I would have for the baller would be: damage upon destruction, inability to pick up ammo, mats, and traps while still inside, the baller taking damage when colliding with player built structures, baller being damaged by storm, and perhaps lower health as well. While this is by no means a comprehensive list, it would help to address some of the strength they currently have. Other changes could be limiting grapple charges (or outright removing it), using a ""fuel"" concept as mentioned before on this sub for planes, and decreased mobility with it. Another idea might be that after a set use time, players are required to ""spend"" (lose) mats in order to continue operating the vehicle, at a rate of let's say 10 mats for every 5 seconds. 

The more balanced mobility items all have downsides that offer a clear risk/reward. Atks easy to be shot, not as viable for later circles, and limited precision movement. Rifts are great but theres the item slot it takes, limited use, and the risk of being defenseless and shot out of the sky. Grapplers had limited use, and players were left vulnerable while grappling. Jump pads have advantage of not taking an item slot, but again risk being shot out of sky, limited use (by how many you have), terrain limitations (somewhat), and the small inconvenience of having to have a clear area to use and the need to be placed. 

The ability to be able to rotate easily, with protection (and complete protection in ballers case), without being limited in use beyond vehicle hp is simply too strong. Even planes were limited in later zones by the amount of space required to stay within the zone and the turning radius they offered. Whereas it is common to see ballers still being used within the final closing circle because of there agility and precision movement. There is also the opportunity cost of spending time shooting players in vehicles during later zones; this is time that could be spent shooting other players to get kills, leaves you more vulnerable to other players, uses ammo, and even if you break the vehicle you still have to deal with knocking the player. This is compounded by the fact that the baller is often stored until needed, thus the first opportunity to shoot it might be when you have to rotate yourself, offering little to no time to actually focus fire it. 

When introducing new forms of mobility to FN Epic should put more emphasis on considering the aspects and advantages offered, and balancing items around having weaknesses that counter the strength they provide. 

If you made it all the way through this, job well done. I apologize for the length, I just wanted to be thorough in my analysis. Feel free to add in anything you wish, that I missed, or critiscism. Thanks for reading! ",FortniteCompetitive
462,xzotc,1553035115,b3406d,20,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b3406d/dont_be_scared_to_try_out_new_keybinds_just/,12,Don't be scared to try out new keybinds just because of what you read,"I've never changed my edit key from G. I'd been contemplating for MONTHS (probably upwards of 6 months) whether to change it or not (and that is after already having changed a main build keybind), but I've always been lazy, because seeing how I don't utilize my thumb for anything other than space (jump), I couldn't think of a keybind to place it (my E is Wall and F Use).

Then the influx of threads that showed how pros use weird-ass keybinds and it works perfectly for them (a few months ago), especially the fact that MrSavage uses F,G,T,F4 and Y for edit has completely had me convinced that my 'G' is perfectly fine. My main builds have their own dedicated finger (M4/5, Q &amp; E), so if MrSvage can edit just as fast using nothing but his index finger, *and* while his edit key is even farther to the right - why couldn't I?

However, just because something is pretty convenient for someone, doesn't make it necessarily just as fine for you. While I have relatively long fingers, pressing G has always been awkward for me, and I think it kinda made me want to avoid editing as frequently.

I just said fuck it and switched my Use and Edit (F and G), and editing on F is so smooth and fun. Feels better right off the bat. It's so close to WASD that I don't have to jump through hoops to fucking press it awkwardly. I figured that G as my Use is fine enough. It's not like you always have to spam that button, and even if you do, you know it in advance and it's not in tight and frequent situations just as edit.

So **tl;dr**: just because it's true that whatever keybinds you have can work, note that they first have to be convenient. If you've been playing with some keybinds for ages now and think to yourself: 'Shit, I'll just get used to it because I know it can work, just like it works for &lt;insert name here&gt;' - don't force it. Other keybinds might be better for you, individually.

I know it sounds obvious when put this way, but just wanted to drop by and say it - don't be lazy and give it a try.",FortniteCompetitive

i always thought that the new pumps are just straight up better than other pumps not only in damage but also the pullout time, but since im too lazy to do the tests myself I asked our u/imspeedygonzalez for some help.

Turns out the difference between the old and new pumps in pulling it out is 66 miliseconds, which is an insane advantage between top tier players.   

Thoughts?    
Do you like the new pumps? Or not really?  
My personal opinion:  

&gt;!I would like to see the new pumps being removed, the only three shotguns I would like to have in game (keep in mind, this is my personal opinion are: blue tactical (slightly buffed pullout delay and damage), blue pump (feels good) and golden heavy shotgun (i think it was a very balanced gun)!&lt;

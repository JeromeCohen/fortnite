There's no banner or loading screen for week 10 (you unlock the 10th loading screen after completing week 9). There's no real incentive to completing week 10 unless you just need the tiers or levels. It would be nice to reward the people who have grinded all season challenge by challenge with something special. A banner or something maybe, I don't know. But there's no real sense of accomplishment to doing all of them other than self enjoyment, but you don't get anything to show for the amount of time you've put into the challenges. Just a thought.

Then there are the people that you spectate, who if you’ve played the game for more than 30 seconds, you’ll clearly see that they are on a sensitivity and a level of accuracy way way higher than a controller can offer.

I seriously hope these new matchmaking changes that are soon to be implemented do something to XIM players, they are literal scum.

All friends were removed, the 2k Vbucks were spent that I had sat on my account. My credit/debit card details were actually REMOVED from the store instead of being used and abused by the hacker. I've never encountered anything so puzzling.. No money spent, they simply removed the details from being saved. Could've easily jacked me of hundreds of £££.

I've enabled 2FA.. Yes, I know this is basic and I stumped here. But I rarely play and it didn't really cross my mind.

All the knight skins in fortnite (black and red knight, and the squires) have fortnite map locations in their description, right?
Red Knight has Anarchy, which was replaced by Lazy Links.
One Squire (can't remember) has Moisty Mire, which was replaced by Paradise Palms
And the other has Tomato Town which is replaced by Tomato Temple.
Do you think Epic made all the knights homeless, as to make room for let's say... A castle for them?
But the real exciting thing is.... Black Knight has Wailing Woods, which isn't gone right? Well, Wailing Woods has the bunker! And I think the bunker will destroy Wailing Woods, leaving the knights to live in their castle!

With the release of BO4, the devs already know they must listen to the fanbase (which they always do for the most part) to continue their journey with a new game. IMO BO4 won't hurt Fortnite too much, competition is always good. Real good. I'mm going to be naming off some things I predict they will do within the next 12 days or hope they will do. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the drum gun going away, it's one step closer to ending the spray meta. The drum gun was my all-time favorite weapon to pair with the shotgun which i'm sure a lot of you feel as well. However, for the first time actually, I see a lot of people claim that they're happy that it left since they died to it many times, and I feel for them as well and I think Epic made a good decision. Can't nerf a gun that's not there ammirite? 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll start off with the SMG's.

**P90** \- I think the P90 is in the best state that it's ever been. When it first came out, I'd take it over the drum gun. Who wouldn't pick up a new gun right off bat anyway? As they nerfed it, we quickly learned the DPS isn't strong, 40 clip is not enough, and the drum gun was simply better. I think the next step would be to either vault it completely, bring the clip size down to 35 like the tac sub, or to replace this with the tac sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Silenced SMG** \- This gun is in one of the best state's in the game as well. It's a great gun to pick up and does quite the damage whether it be bodyshot/headshot as a starter weapon in the game. No need for changes.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMG** \- I personally think this is a pretty balanced gun. I know it's weaker than the silenced sub and P90 in certain aspects but the gun has great hipfire and is very usable until the very end of the match. No need for changes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pump Shotgun -** I hate to say it, but I think the pump's are fine right now. Yes it's worse than it used to be but it's better than hitting 260's to the head. I think Epic took out double pump at a bad time since they nerfed shotgun damage. With the nerf, double shotgun was actually usable while pump to tac sub was already almost better than it. People were able to choose what kind of gun fight they wanted to get into and let the better player to come out on top. I do think double pump will come back soon since the spray meta is still in use. People that have gotten used to pump to sub will have their advantage but people that know how to double pump will also have their own advantage. I think it'll be a cool thing to see. This is also why I'm OK that the drum is gone. If double pump comes back, drum would still laser. (rip to the drum + double pump loadout though).

&amp;#x200B;

**Tac Shotgun -** People on Twitter that keep begging for common pump and Purple tac to come out are just annoying. I personally choose the blue pump over the blue tac but that's just me. I think the Blue tac becoming purple again is just useless. Epic knows what they're doing and they make changes for the better future. They are trying out things and nothing is forever. This is a good time to keep in mind to NEVER get too comfortable with a specific gun or meta. I remember being dependent on double pump and as much as I loved it and how much I hate the spray meta, it gave the game a cool twist for newcomers that aren't used to a two shotgun loadout. Now tracking back to the tac shotgun, I think the gun is also pretty balanced. A good fire rate, not too OP at all, a great first gun to pick up in the beginning of a match that fight off a sub-machine gun in very early game. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Heavy Shotgun -** Remember when people used to keep the blue pump over the purple heavy? Jeez, those were some broken times. This is definitely one of my favorite shotguns, I'm glad they can really compare to the double barrel since both are excellent guns. I've heard people wanted a faster fire rate but in that case I feel like they should lower the damage. Or just not change anything at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Double Barrel -** A great shotgun, very balanced as well since you HAVE to be up close to use. a little OP for scrims but I have a huge feeling this gun will be vaulted if double pump ever comes back or keep the delay with these so that no one is able to *double double barrel.* 

&amp;#x200B;

That's honestly it for the guns. I love the state that every other gun is in, they're listening to us about the bursts, slowly but surely changes are happening. Every season is huge, it's just a matter of time before changes happen. There will always be people complaining but remember, change is good and never get too comfortable with a specific meta. If it's your first season, pick up different guns and stop going for the win. Work on your K/D trust me.

(looong),"I want to get something straight before I rant. I still rely on my parents money for video games or any dlc/microtransactions. This doesn’t make me a squeaker cause I am in the awkward age where I have matured past screaming at everything but not so that I have my own source of income. I didn’t want people screaming at me saying your just a kid who uses his mom’s credit card and completely disregard his opinion. Thought I’ll tell you that.

Fortnite (IN MY OPINION) has grown too popular for its own good. Everything in Fortnite this and Fortnite that and frankly I’m sick of the game. The new SMG meta is the worst and most overpowered thing to happen to this game since Zapotron Sniper. I just wish Epic gave the same response to that than the spray happy SMGs or guns similar to that which plague the game. 

There is only one singular reason why I continue to play this game. Friends. They play the game and since it’s Im not the best socially it really the only interaction I have had with them until school.That is it. 

I have been playing since late Season 1 when I was near the first for my friend group to play. Only me and 1 other guy I knew played the game  and holy shit did we have fun. Dicking around in Dusty Depot and the factories was some of the funniest moments of my life. I fell in love with it and I constantly played even though I was dogshit. The last time I remember this feeling was when the shopping carts came out and I hopped on and fooled around with them and that was an isolated case. 

Fortnite has lost its charm, what made the game stand out from all the other shooters in the market. It was silly goofy and no one took it serious. Now everyone’s tryharding to become the next Ninja or win some big e-sports event. That is not what the game meant for me. The game takes it self too seriously.

My friends obviously do not share the same views that I do or make them public and suck it up as I do. I want to buy a better shooter style game that I can play with my friends but as I said it’s not my money that I “waste” on these games. BO4 R6 all seem like great games I would love to try, but they cost 80 or 50$ Canadian and that’s a lot of money. I have also tried free games like warframe and Destiny 2 but, I don’t get that same feeling. 

All of my friends still play Fortnite. Call me a sheep or a follower but I want the relevancy you get when playing a game that everyone else does. That why I can’t quit. I’m not the most social person and playing Fortnite is something that I have in common. 

I don’t know what I want to get from this rant but my opinion to be heard and people to give me theirs or agree/disagree. I just want to say something that been in my mind for awhile but never had the courage until know to say. Thanks.

ARs

Scar - I believe that the scar is in a balanced state and doesn’t need to buffed or nerfed.

Silenced Scar - I know this gun is new but I think it may need a small buff, maybe lower the bloom from continuous shots.

Burst AR - This gun is actually really good in the right hands. It may need a small buff though because it is barely used by most people.


Snipers 

Semi Auto - This gun is pretty bad and either needs a full rework or just vault it.

Bolt Action - This gun is very good but is nothing compared to the heavy sniper. To buff it I think it needs to have a shorter reload to make it a actual choice between it and the heavy.

Heavy - I think this gun doesn’t need to be touched because it is quite rare and is not worth taking over a scar, shotgun or SMG.


Shotguns 

Heavy Shotgun - This gun is great with a SMG but on its own it is pretty bad. Maybe just increase the fire rate.

Dual Barrel - If you can hit your shots it is a awesome gun but if you have bad aim (like me) it is absolutely terrible.

Pump - I’m going to get a lot of hate for this. This is the worst shotgun by far. If you want use a shotgun on its own without an SMG use the tac, if you want to pair a shotgun with a SMG, use the dual or the heavy.

Tactical - This gun needs a couple of buffs to make it a stand alone gun without a SMG. First buff the range then lower the bloom.


SMGs

P90 - This gun is overpowered now that the drum guns gone. It needs a big nerf to the small amount of bloom it gets.

Silenced SMG - Now this weapon is not as good as the P90 but better than the other SMG.

SMG - Not much needs to be said. Worst SMG but still very usable.

I just need to say again that this is all my opinion and feel free to put your opinion in the comments.



Like for a part two where I will talk about pistols, the minigun and the LMG because this took a lot of work.

Maybe you are like me : you bought a Battle Pass and you didn't make it to the tier 100 in time... not good enough, no time or whatever is your excuse. And you weren't into the game enough to put money for extra tiers so bye bye Black Knight, John Wick or Omega with lights... ~~This is so sad Alexa play Despacito~~

&amp;#x200B;

But I understand that the players who made it to the final tier are proud to show their OG skin to the rest of the lobby, and won't agree with the battle pass being rebuyable for anyone, because it's a reward from being here at the time it was available.

That is what makes the charm of these items : if you can floss, worm, gangnam style or wave, it shows that you are here from quite a long time now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking : **why not giving a Last Chance for people who bought their uncompleted Battle Pass ?**

It will keep the ""OG"" aspect of the items, and the players who made it to tier 100 will have no reason to complain.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conditions to buy the Last Chance :

* You must have bought the original Battle Pass during the period of time it was available
* The Battle Pass you have decided to choose must be uncompleted : below tier 100 and/or tier 100 challenges uncompleted (especially for Season 4 with Omega)
* You can buy one Last Chance for each uncompleted Battle Pass
* You cannot buy another Last Chance for an uncompleted Battle Pass if you failed\*
* You cannot buy a Last Chance if there is already one active Last Chance's Battle Pass\*\*
* You must pay 1000 V-Bucks for each Last Chance\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

# Here is how it works :

1. *You pay your Last Chance in the same menu where you buy V-Bucks and skin packs*
2. *A message asks you what Battle Pass you want to try, depending on what is available for you*
3. *A confirmation message warns you that it is not refundable, and one-time offer for the specific Battle Pass you have decided to choose. Maybe add an input text box where you have to write ""CONFIRMATION"" to confirm your choice*
4. *When you recieve the old Battle Pass, you start in tier 1 no matter which tier you stopped at (the item will be greyed to show that you already have it)*
5. *You have the same amount of time to complete your Battle Pass that it was before*
6. *The weekly challenges of the Battle Pass are the same than before. For challenges of gone locations (RIP Moisty Mire and Anarchy Acres), maybe change the name of location (Moisty Mire --&gt; Paradise Palms; Anarchy Acres --&gt; Lazy Links etc...) or replace it to a random challenge if not possible*
7. *You have daily challenges for this Last Chance's Battle Pass\*\*\*\**
8. *The XP bonuses you earn during a Battle Pass cannot apply to the other Battle Pass*
9. *The Last Chance's Battle Pass is a solo grind : no XP bonuses from friends (it should be hard to complete)*

&amp;#x200B;

Alternative ideas :

\* : You can buy another Last Chance if you failed : increase the price at the next try by 100% (the name ""Last Chance"" will need to be changed so)

\*\* : Or maybe you can, to save time for players if they did not complete several Battle Pass. Not having the possibility to buy several Last Chances at the same time will increase the amount of time spent on the game for these players

\*\*\* : It could be more or less than 1000 V-Bucks, depending on what do you think is better. Maybe a higher price would be better considering it would be amazing to have the chance to get the items we missed

\*\*\*\* : Maybe add XP with the battle stars you earn during the daily challenges, so the grind is not too hard.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR : for 1000 V-Bucks, you can redo a Battle Pass you bought and didn't complete to have the remaining items.**

&amp;#x200B;

This idea is super viable for Epic Games because there is so many players who didn't complete their Battle Pass and regret it. Some of these players spend a lot of money into the game, and they won't leave the opportunity to finally complete it.

So they will spend money and time on the game.

And the items stays OG, because you need to have purchased the original Battle Pass to have your Last Chance : that means you are OG too !

Some players think this OG aspect is ridiculous, but it is essential to keep this hype about skins in Fortnite. That is the main part of the economy of this game.

In my case, I will definitely buy one Last Chance for Season 2 Battle Pass, no matter what the price will be because I play Fortnite a lot, I bought all of the Battle Passes and my favourite skin is the only final tier skin that I missed.

Red Knight is a way better skin, and it was overhyped, you barely red knights in the lobby anymore, people just wanted it because is rare, and that is such a stupid reason to get a skin, I get a skin because I like it not because is rare.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say Epic decides to re sell skull trooper and ghoul, they will become the most overused skins for weeks before people stop using them, just watch. Most people that want them back are children that went them because they are rare.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say Epic brings back all those rare skins, guess what's gonna happen, people will start begging Epic to release Recon Expert, again ugly skin, but its RaaRE. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I would buy if old things came back would be reaper and thats it, not because is rare but because I like it, I still hope Epic does not release any of those skins back, the only reason is because it would be nice to keep seeing people beg only for a skin that they will release is not that good if they ever got it.

Bandages heal 15 HP in 3.5 seconds, let’s compare this to all other available heals, assuming time between heals is negligible.

Mini Shield - 50 shield in ~4 seconds.
Bandages - 15 HP in 3.5 seconds

Big Shield - 100 shield in ~10 seconds
Bandages - 45 HP in ~10.5 seconds

Medkit - 100 HP in 10 seconds
Bandages - 45 HP in ~ 10.5 seconds

Chug Jug - 100 HP + 100 Shield in 15 seconds
Bandages - 60 HP in ~14 seconds

As you can see, every heal in the game heals more than twice as fast as bandages. This is not to mention that bandages can only heal you to 75 HP. While bandages shouldn’t be better than any of these items, they’re extremely useless right now.

My proposal - Cut heal time from 3.5 s to 2 second, reduce max stack size to 10. 

With this balance, bandages would remain the slowest heal in the game, but would not be so slow that there is almost no reason to pick them up. Reducing stack size to 10 to combat storm healing in late circles. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

I recently tried to claim the skin via a demo phone, needless to say I was too late and didn't get it.

Yesterday I found a guy who was willing to do it for me. I might be impatient but I still haven't got it(soon 24hrs), and I heard people get it after 8 hours or so.

What are the odds that:
1) the first attempt on the demo phone blocked the account from claiming the skin?

2) that this time it takes more than the usual?

3) I tried looking at the career stats via the PC to see what gamemode he played and it seems like the last track of career on each mode was not set to recently meaning either the PC's tracking and the galaxy tracking are not synced or that he simply didnt do it eventually?

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

At the end of Season of Season 4 I was at my most consistent with a 4.5 K/D (and quickly on the rise) exclusively playing duo squads. As of right now for Season 5 my K/D is sitting at 3.97 and declines basically every time I play. I used to run solo squads/duos all the time and feel confident taking on teams and now I almost only play solos and feel extremely inconsistent. Yes, I know that a lot of people would say that is good, but if I'm not improving, I'm not really having fun. 

I didn't make this post to complain, just curious how many people feel like their skills have just declined without double shotguns? It's unfortunate because I'm a much better player now IMO than I was before, but I feel so unsatisfied and inconsistent with this meta.

For you is Fortnite BR coming to an end? 

By this I mean is the playerbase fall a common thing due to new things not being added or is it really something with a bit more traction. I have played this game since Nov 17' and while I do deem myself to be decent, I feel there is a real aura around that this game is actually going downhill; For Evidence Fortnite while still being streamed the most is not the force it use to be reckoned with; Everyone on Twitch and their dog use to be streaming it but now its only really the main guys who even now are picking up new games and streaming that instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say this because I feel like myself has had enough of Fortnite, I don't want to play it anymore, I don't want to buy any skins and the game just feels more a chore now due to everyone being Bob the Builder with subpar shooting but why does that matter if you can build 200 pieces a second; Now you can just say ahh you must doo doo then but I have a respectable 400 wins on PS4 + Xbox meaning I am no pushover, But I just feel like the core mechanics of the game are not there anymore; The Old fortnite was much simpler and had 3 main elements of the game Pump/ AR/ Sniper : From this I mean Pump was for up close, AR was for Medium/Long Range and the sniper is for long range; Now days those rules seem to have been skewed and any gun can be used for short range now (in some cases the AR comes out on top due to damage output and if landing all sprayed bullets).

The release of a new map would solidify Fortnites dominance in the gaming world. Don’t get me wrong, even though it is has already made history and as of now is almost untouchable, it is still in a delicate state with players still questioning if it has what it takes to last for years to come (I doubt epic would ever ruin this game but as my parents fought me always prepare for the worst).

With fortnite battle royales birthday around the corner I feel like a late present wouldn’t hurt anyone with the upcoming season 6.

This is the season we epic needs to make the most rememberable, this is the big one. I’m sure we all know that one person who is just burnt out of the game, maybe it could be yourself. Whoever it may be, you know that person needs that one refresher, something to get them glued to their seats once again.

Ever since the introduction of season 4 we’ve all been curious as too what is beyond the horizon, could we possibly explore the galaxy.

Personally I would love a new map that functioned the same way but with a completely new theme, for instance instead of metal you can now collect obsidian. And instead of your guns shooting bullets they could be literal laser beams!

My silly suggestion aside, this is what I feel the game deserves and would make players not even feel like trying out these new releases.

According to Week 10's loading screen, we see a different version of brite bomber, with a different chest logo and evil eyes, possibly hinting towards a new style for brite bomber in season 6. I saw another post saying the leaked Hacivat skin is actually a character that mirrors with another character in a Turkish play. With that being said, I believe that Epic will add new styles to a variety of skins. To re-release ""rare"" or limited time skins, Epic could re-design the skins so that when it is purchasable in the shop, you cannot receive the original skin, but a re-designed skin that will probably look a lot better, keeping value in the original skin. Original skin owners could get the re-design for free, too, or through challenges. It would be interesting to see a Skull Trooper re-design that puts the standards up to par with the design we see in current Fortnite skins, because the Skull Trooper is, let's be honest, a poorly designed skin when Fortnite was first released.

But anyway, season 5 was a trainwreck. Season 4 was so a trainwreck, but it was far better than season 5. Everything about it was horrible. It all started with the “ShOtGuN MeTa” which lead to them all (except the heavy) getting nerfed to the ground. This lead to the main gun in fortnite not being a go to option anymore, leading to annoying shotgun damage. By far the worst part of this season though was the meta. You can ask any streamer and most casuals, this meta was hot garbage. It started with the smg buff, then to tac smg vault, then the addition of the drum, p90, and smg. These all lead up to the spray meta, which quickly turned “Just build lol” into “Just spray lol”. Epic stated they wanted diversity, but there is none right now, as it is an AR, shotgun shot, followed up by an smg. 



Now let’s get to the storyline, which is still very lackluster and confusing. Let’s take a look at some of the previous seasons storylines: season 3 - a mysterious comet comes

season 4 - comet crashes, gives birth to the Visitor who flys a rocket to his “home” creating rifts

Season 5 - ?


It is full of lightning and a purple cube. Kinda bland considering the badass previous storylines. All of these points lead into the fact that season 5 was horrible, and it would be very hard for epic to make Season 6 worse.",FortNiteBR

Do you think it was the lackluster season 5 (terrible meta and unnecessary SMG buff along with no story) or is it something else? I don’t know why but I could care less if season 6 happened or not, just am hoping for the faster edits for console and maybe some other feature changes. Regardless, season 6 is almost here!

Many people in this community believe it was better in season 2, but there's still the separate part of the community who believe that this game is in a balanced state and is thriving. A game mode that simulates the peak gameplay of season 2-season 3, but is keeping up with the map changes and challenges while keeping the base game modes would be something to appeal to the ""OG's,"" as people call them and players who enjoyed the older state of the game, while keeping the same current base game modes that other players seem to enjoy. It would be sort of like 50v50 and Playgrounds where it will be permanent, and some vaulted weapons would return, and new weapons will stay out. Materials would be reverted to what they were before the nerf, older stats on the dreaded ""inconsistent"" shotguns will return, and other newer mechanics like phasing would be reverted. The tabs on the right determine whether or not you want to play squads, solos, or duos, which gets rid of the problem of people having to wait weeks to play a game mode with all of their friends. I understand that a game mode like this would take a long time to develop, but its only a concept for a game mode and a suggestion to the developers. :)",FortNiteBR

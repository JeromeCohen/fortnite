I’m wondering if there’s a strategy behind it, like waiting for a team to be in an engagement, waiting for a storm, etc.

I know liquid is one of the best if not the best teams, and I’m probably not going to get a perfect answer from people who aren’t on TL, but I want to start doing solo snipes and the knowledge of *when* to push for high would be super helpful to know so I can improve on it.

Hey all,

over the last one and a half months I've been maintaining a list with non-gameplay altering features, (bug) fixes and optimalizations for console (PS4, XBOX and Switch); usually often requested, but sometimes overlooked, but important nonetheless. So far, I've posted 5 versions on the main fortnite subreddit some 1-2 weeks apart ([latest version](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/93q208/the_complete_console_wish_list_v5/)). This post is not to promote these posts, but because I need your help. I've hardly been playing for the past few weeks, so I can't keep the list up-to-date... so this is where you come in. DM me, or comment below, the stuff that is missing, outdated or whatever.

Thanks.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Looking for a player that needs a consistent partner. I am NAE, Xbox. I dont want to cross play. I could care less what your stats are (wins, k/d etc) because mine aren’t great either. I want a kind of partnership where we strive to make each other better, with constructive criticism, and constant scrims. Age doesn’t matter all that much to me as long as you can be mature. 

If this is something you are looking for shoot me a PM, dont just leave your GT in the comments and say “add me”. Seriously want committed people. I’m also open to squading up if there is a good group of people.

I play an occasional tournament (won a few) but it seems the only challenge I get nowadays is solely in wagers. I've tried snipe matches but it seems as if I rarely get into lobbies and if I do, the players aren't as skilled.

To use the product you have to have a wired connection to the PS4 at all times which I thought was gonna be eh. However when you connect the controller, it turns it from a wireless connection to a wired and removes all lag from the controller input. After trying it out, I did not realize how delayed everything was before. My edits are registering smoother, and I can build multiple things in quicker succession e.g Do ramp floor wall much more quickly now.

It's supposed to be the definition of high risk and and high reward, with only two shots and a really long reloading time. However, switching to a SMG right after firing both shots completely removes the risk factor.  
This was the case with the Pump, sure.  
But being able to dish out 85 damage if you're lucky pales in comparison to the pretty consistent 300+ damage you get from the barrel in about the same amount of time.  
I hate this gun so damn much.  
It's literally everything that makes this meta so unfun.  
It basically punishes you for getting the highground, by making half of your pellets get into your own building.  
There's no reward for headshots anymore, as most of the pellets will still hit the body, even when being perfectly aligned with the head.

I decided to send it and run two shottys in my layout. It worked great to my surprise


Basically, all you need is a double barrel, drum gun, and blue tact. What I did was I would get in one players face and get the high burst damage with the double barrel, then switch over to the drum gun. If the double barrel didn't finish him off, I would switch over to the drum and finish him off then switch over to the tact and I would /maybe/ get a slight delay but in this situation after you knock the first guy you'd probably build right after, so not a big deal. Then you'd use the blue tact to kill the other guy, or build away to reload the double barrel. 

This strat worked wonders for me,  but unfortunately I lost the game because I got trapped in a 1x1 and decided to try and trap him, but wasn't quick enough and he moved to the opposite side to not get hit and kill me. Stupid play on my part. I should've ended up with 15 kills using this setup but instead got 12. Anyways, this loadout was great for solo duo at least, not sure about the other modes.

Let me know what you think about it. Is it practical or does it take too much space? I personally, will try it out more often because it felt like old times shotgunnig people. ",FortniteCompetitive

77,DFSRJames,1533655196,95cjen,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/95cjen/a_more_precise_look_at_what_needs_to_change_about/,11,"A more precise look at what needs to change about building, spam, and mats","I think basically everyone in this sub can agree that we want the outcome of a given fight to be based more towards skill and less toward ""spamming"" and ""rng"" than the average player, but after seeing countless posts about how ""building needs a buff"" or ""spamming needs a nerf"" I think the arguments have gotten far too imprecise for Epic to take them seriously. Here's my try at breaking down the issue in a more granular way.

1) Every single person can agree that mats should be easier to farm. Contrary to what epic seems to believe, mats taking forever to farm actually just hurts the casual player more than the skilled players. As you've seen in scrims and skirmishes, skilled players will almost always take the time to farm the mats they need. In pubs, pro-level players never run out of mats. In skirmishes, pro-level players mostly run out of mats due to unlucky circles (i.e., not being able to take as much time to farm due to having to run) or extremely prolonged build fights. 

If mats were easier to farm, new players would be less likely to think to themselves ""Why am I hitting this tree for 7 wood when I could be running around looking for loot?!"", and in general we'd spend less time crouch-spamming and pressing M1.

2) It is very hard to balance material strength across solos, duos, and squads. If you watch pro level solo matches you can see that building can still basically counter high-ground spam. Building floors and pyramids repeatedly while moving around will keep off one dedicated spammer for the most part. This leaves the player with the high ground with a difficult decision - should he drop down and rip through a wall, but give up his high ground advantage, or should he continue to press the issue from above? Buffing mats too far could take away from high ground advantage even further, and make turtling so strong that going after a turtler isn't worth it. We want building to be effective counter-play to play defensively or catch our breath for a second, not so effective that it deters people from even attacking us and getting into a war of attrition.

On the flip side, builds are pretty easy to rip through if you have more than 1 player trying to do so at the same time, hence the concerns about great players having more difficulty 1vXing these days. I'm not sure I have a great suggestion here, but I just wanted to highlight that mats/spam interact very differently based on the number of players on a team, which is something this sub rarely seems to acknowledge.

3) It's okay that some weapons destroy buildings like a hot knife through butter, but it's generally not great that those same weapons are also excellent for killing the opponent. An ideal interaction in my mind would be, use your explosives to tear down the builds, and then kill the opponent with your guns. Or, use your LMG or minigun to rip down the builds, at which point you can quickly switch over to your fighting weapon and go from there.

As it stands, the delay in switching weapons (a very real culprit in tightening the skill gap) makes it infeasible to rip down a build with one weapon and switch over to a shotgun or whatever, and the ability of various weapons (notably the drum gun and the p90) to wreck builds AND wreck opponents means players rarely have the incentive to prioritize certain guns for certain situations. 

The interaction with explosives where the first hit the build and the ones after that hit the player is also kinda dumb. It makes no sense realistically and also leads to accidental spam kills. I think explosives could be faster at shredding builds, but that they should just explode one another simultaneously the way they would in real life to avoid the feeling of dying ""out of nowhere.""

4) Adding another inventory slot would allow for more specific use items and take away the need for one-size-fits-all items like the drum gun. It's okay that players need to make tough decisions occasionally based on style - do I want too carry minis AND big pots or should I grab this hunting rifle? - but IMO it's more fun to have the skill be based around switching between your inventory in the moment rather than leaving behind an item you might really miss later.

TL;DR:

1) Make gathering mats take less time. This helps everyone and helps casual players the most since they are the least likely to invest the time to farm appropriate mats.

2) Balancing material strength across solos, duos, and squads is very difficult, and some patience is warranted as Epic tinkers with the balance there.

3) More weapon specialization in conjunction with removing/minimizing weapon pull-out delay. It's more fun and takes more skill to switch from your LMG to your shotgun to your SMG than it is to just pull out your drum gun and pressing W and M1.

4) Add an extra item slot to take off the pressure of having guns that can do everything while making it more fun for the players.

Thanks for reading! Hoping for a good discussion as we try and pin down the real issues in a precise way, rather than just throwing out general and non-specific complaints.",FortniteCompetitive

Well, this patch proved those people wrong.

\&gt;Vending Machine rebalance.

What could possibly indicate that vending machines needed a buff? more importantly, who cares! nobody complained about them, vending machines just existed, not even the casual players were crying vending machine buffs.

Then \*why\* did Epic go out of their way to buff them? what could be the motive? especially when a lot of other balance issue should have been prioritized. 

Don't get me wrong, i am not opposed to the buff, but this change is non existent, vending machines are still useless, farming is hard as is.

Truly feels like they throw this change out there to fill the re-balance quota, seems very lazy to me.

\&gt;Added a higher accuracy penalty to jumping and sprinting for Dual Pistols, Submachine Guns, and Hunting Rifles.

why. what could possibly motivate a dual pistol nerf ? i just don't understand what kind of data they collected to justify such a nerf (Yes, it affects the dual pistols the most, because that's how most people would use it), dual pistols are probably the worst weapon affected by bloom.

Also feels like they added in SMG just to say ""Look guys, we did nerf smg's!"", when in reality, this change is minimal when it comes to SMG's, what's worse is that the people in the main sub will use this ""nerf"" to shut down people who criticize the smg meta, and dismiss those people.

In general, terrible patch, even worse than the update that P90 was introduced.

why? because a lot of people have gotten sick and tired of this BS meta, this was Epic's chance to redeem themselves, but they only showed that they do not care, and i told myself i will stop playing this game until i see big meta overhauls, and i will stand by my word, Epic lost my hope and trust in them. so for now all i can do is wait for them to redeem themselves.

In conclusion: it's apparent that Epic is doing balance changes on the fly, nothing is consistent, there's no real goal.

none of the communities big concerns has been addressed.

Play the game EPIC has for us, not the one you want. EPIC is by far the best video game team I’ve EVER seen, I’ve never played a game that gets weekly updates, I can’t even recall games where monthly updates were common.

Please take your 2 week break, heck don’t even ever come back to Fortnite if your attitude is so negative towards this great team and game.

Fortnite is actually in a pretty good state right now and is not the equivalent to a slot machine.,"So first let me preface this by saying it definelty isn’t at its best, and there is definelty room to grow, I simply think that the state it is in right now is pretty good and I don’t think the supposed spam meta is that much of an issue.

Now again let me preface this by saying that I am only going to be speaking about solos and duos here and also only about public matches (not scrims), I personally do think that squads truly are in a terrible place. 

Finally, before I start, here are my stats: [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/LYT%20No%20Skin](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/LYT%20No%20Skin) 

Obviously I’m not the best player in the world but I think a 5kd and 15 percent win rate for an ultra aggressive player is pretty good. (Season 5) Also I have half as many kills as ninja so far and he plays about 3 times as much as me so that should show you just how aggressive  I am.

I see a lot of posts on this sub about how people have gotten so much worse during season 5 and the meta is in such a bad state that they don't even want to play anymore. While I understand that Fortnite has been and most likely will be in a somewhat better state than it is now in the future I just don't understand how people can hate the game so much right now. 

I'm still able to get 5 - 10 solo wins a day and drop 15 or more kill wins at a consistent and growing rate while using the same play style i used before the smgs became godly. I still rely mostly on my building, use basically the same load out with minor exceptions such as running a drum gun, and still get the majority of my damage done using shotguns. 

Maybe I'm just better than everyone else (very unlikely) or maybe everyone is just exaggerating a lot and whining on this sub constantly. I feel like people are dying to a drum gun in a completely legitimate way once and then getting mad and using this sub as a way to release their anger. 

Maybe I'm just crazy but as a player who has been playing since season 1 i just don't see why people are complaining so much... FORTNITE IS LIT!",FortniteCompetitive

- https://www.twitch.tv/videos/293838733?t=00h40m12s

- Mongraal is an **insane player** and watching him use his building ability to outplay two other players in a 2 vs 1 situation is **mesmerising** especially when the odds were not in his favour his health was low he still won the build battle. This is where fortnite shines, the ability to outperform/counter others on such a high level all depending on your building ability, is what attracted me and so many others to the game.

- As soon as he defeated those two players another two players attacked him. Both spamming miniguns holding W and mouse 1 and using barely any skill involved. With this strat they were able to put him low health and mongraal is **forced** to play extremely defensive and retreat from the battle.

One single player that has mastered the game should easily be able to eliminate two players using strategies which undermine building. The battle is [**building**](https://i.redd.it/u7kbps98ae511.jpg)

This is my biggest issue with the game right now, rewarding players in situations where they should not be rewarded. There is no [**counterplay**](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/counterplay-and-play-styles) in that spam strategy. No thought that goes into it. Just a mindless and unskillful element that has saturated fortnite. 

Its not a good look for competitive and players who have spent months, weeks and countless of hours learning how to build just look stupid.

There are many ways mindless spamming with certain weapons can be fixed..

- Adding an overheat function to the Minigun / LMG.

- Increase shotgun damage to encourage players to take that small chance when being spammed

IMO the game is not in a healthy state right now, I know its a **controversial** opinion but that clip of Mongraal shows the state of the meta perfectly? What do you think?

174,The_OG_Snorlax,1533574807,9530xj,118,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9530xj/comprehensive_list_of_proposed_balance_changes/,778,Comprehensive List of Proposed Balance Changes - The What and the Why,"The goal of these balance changes is to promote pushing/aggressive play, lessening the effectiveness of the ""spray and pray"" meta, and to shift the counters of turtling from fast fire rate guns to utility options such as Stink bombs, clingers, C4, and replacing/editing of walls.


**Wood** - Wood changes are reverted, both starting health and total health

**Why** - Wood is primarily used for pushing enemies, with the recent wood strength change it has become too easy to shoot down an enemy who is pushing or trying to build up. The main reason this was done was to address turtling and boxing in. Those will be addressed through other points/items.


**Edit Peeking** - Like sight in to the storm, when peeking through the edit viewer distant objects will be obfuscated, and near objects will be visible.

**Why** - The edit peek change did not serve its intended purpose of preventing players from gaining visibility when camping in a box. Players get around this by using pyramids and ramps for peeking. What this change did do is hurt aggressive play and assist turtling. This was done by making a wall edit to shotgun far less ideal, and helped turtling because someone who is in a massive build structure can more easily hide when the player attacking them can no longer replace their walls and look for them.


**Drum Gun** - Reduce damage, reduce clip size, and possibly add in damage more penalizing damage falloff.

**Why** - The drum gun is arguable the best gun in the game. Its DPS is very high, and its utility is top tier in terms of providing reliable damage to palyers, shooting structures, and having a very large clip with a medium fire rate.


**Stink Bombs** - Increase carry rate to 6, increase drop rate.

**Why** - They come in stacks of 3, make the total stack 6 because OCD and to increase their viability as they are a great turtling counter. Increase drop rate to further promote the use of stink bombs. 


**Shotguns** - Tricky one here... Remove pump pull out delay. Slightly less damage fall off for all shotguns (aka slightly able to shoot further, verbiage for this changes from person to person). Increase damage to tac and pump (do not allow pump to 1 shot)

**Why** - Pump delay is unnecessary at this point. Helping the shotgun at range/with damage is needed to counter SMGs which currently dominate shotguns at short range and at short-mid range.


**Burst Rifles** - Slight increase to structure damage, reduce bloom.

**Why** - Make them suck less. They are awful at dealing with structures, and can be more viable as an option to sneak in shots on someone turtling. The 2nd and 3rd shots of burst rifles are far too inaccurate at this point, but they should not be increased to the point in which if the first shot hits they all do, then they would be overpowered in terms of player damage.


**Deagle/Revolver** - Reduce damage falloff, allow first shot accuracy to be reached in slightly less time. In air bloom is reduced to be on par with bloom with boots on the ground.

**Why** - These guns do barely more than a scar shot from range, and they take too long to reach first shot accuracy to justify exposing yourself for that long. Lastly the in air buff is to give these guns a niche role of dynamic in air weapons. Just imagine getting a quick turnaround 180 deagle shot for 150+ damage that didn't happen solely because you got ""good bloom"".


**P90x** - Reduce clip size.

**Why** - This gun can be shot for far too long in its current state. 40 would be ideal. I also do not want to neuter SMG damage at this point with the wood health reversion. They do have a high DPS still in close quarters, but the shotgun buff should help with that, and the wood health increase will allow a shotgun+quick wall to be an effective strategy against spray.


**Minigun** - Increase bloom. Minigun overheats after extended use. 1 to half second cooldown and must revamp the fire rate.

**Why** - This one can go either way, but figured I'd throw it out there. The miniguns role is for damaging structures, not players, so bloom should be increased a tiny bit. The minigun can be held down against structures for far too long with the 1K small bullet cap. It is also very easy to walk and spray after someone as the mini gun outclasses the scar in DPS (by 15%) and is on par with the drum gun in terms of DPS.


**Explosives** - Have a dynamic blast radius with falloff in terms of structure damage. (Does NOT apply to C4)

**Why** - Happy medium of the massive damage to structures they do now and the only one wall they would take down in the old days. The main issue with the RL/GL in this state is that they can take out a multilayer ramp push in one shot, which makes it near impossible to push a player with a RL in a metal 1x1. This will be the happy medium, and the best use against a multilayer ramp push would be to go RPG, and they AR down the remaining health of the walls that were only slightly affected by the reduced ""outer layer"" damage. Slows shooting down a push in terms of overall DPS, forces some more thought in managing reloads and switching weapons.

This is all I have recommendations on at this point. I'm sure there are some great ideas for C4, clingers, SMG damage, and others that I couldn't think of. Overall I think C4 and clingers are in a pretty good spot as they are bad against players and great against turtling. The main issue I have against SMGs (and kind of minigun) is that they are the best option against players and structures, so you can seamlessly shoot down a structure and then mow down a player.

I don't really want to add to the ""this meta is bad"" circlejerk (and a well-deserved circlejerk it is), but it's just infinitely better to have a shotgun-based meta to solve any ping-related issues since it's nearly impossible for someone to shoot a shotgun through a wall. 

It's rare to ""hold a wall"" against a sprayer (it's not really the best thing to do in a lot of situations), but the few times where you'd have to do that with low HP might just happen like every 30 games or so and you'd have no chance to win.

I have a logitech mouse with 2 side buttons but other than that a normal keyboard. What i ask of you guys (what would be really helpful), is to review my keybind ""draft"", and maybe you guys that have played pc fortnite for months, could spot a weak spot or two in my binds.
What i have thought out is this:

Weapon 1 (shotgun): q
Weapon 2 (smg/drum): c
Weapon 3 (ar): t
Weapon 4 (sniper,splodes/meds): 4
Weapon 5 (meds): 5

Wall: Mouse button 4 (the front one)
Floor: e
Ramp: r (i am more comfortable pressing r than e)
Pyramid: Shift (i would be playing with sprint by default)
Trap: Mouse button 5 (the back one)

Reload: The scroll wheel button
Pick up: f

* Constant snipes. Our NA Discord has only been up for 12 days, and we already have over 11,000 active members. This allows us to constantly hold snipes of 50+ players at a time. This provides great practice for you and your team. 
* League Matches. Our NA discord currently has league matches on Wednesday, Friday and Sundays at 7PM EST. League Matches are were you and your team can compete against others for points, and teams with the most points at the end of the season will be moved up to our Champs League. We would then review the top performing teams in the Champs League to possibly be moved up to the Pro League to compete with highly skilled teams such as TSM, Liquid, FaZe, etc.

We have recently launched our EU branch! So if you're an EU player no worries, we have you covered.

This video made by Martoz 2 months ago shows why a shotgun being able to hit for 200+ is extremely important to the game. Especially in the spam meta we have now. 

Countless times, I have been spammed and hurt needing to heal up in a box. And now with the new spamming movement of guns we have, a shotgun doing 200+ damage is needed. When someone is spamming your walls with a gun that shoots faster than you can possibly build there needs to be an out in a situation like that. When someone shoots until they morph through your wall you can’t rely on an SMG/p90/drum gun spam off to win a fight. If a player is in a tough situation like this, they should be able to land all of their shotgun pellets on someone’s face to counter the spam. 

Many people may disagree with this suggestion, but in my opinion, shotguns being able to do 200+ damage again is a great way to balance out this close range spray and pray bullshit that has been added to the game!

I've seen a lot of discussion on how bringing back double pump or double shotguns in general will help remove the spam meta, and I've seen many things in the game that make me think that wont happen. 

To put it simply, bringing back double pump and doing nothing to SMGs as a whole will NOT change the meta of just spamming until you kill your opponent. People will quickly realize that the spam can easily outplay builders with double pump around 80% of the time and will stick with SMGs. Unless they are given an extreme nerf, either to their overall damage, or to their damage against structures, SMGs will stay as the meta if double pump is brought back. Even if they only nerf the damage to structures, people with good/decent aim will still use the SMG due to its raw power and its ability to rip through shield and health very quickly. Players will soon realize that double pump is indeed a poor choice with SMGs in their current state in the game, and nothing will change.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm pretty sure that this sub has seen how shit are pro scrims right now, it's all about looting for 15 minutes and then turtling after the 4th storm and see who has more healing available. If Epic suddenly reverts all the nerfs to building and SMGs, explosives and miniguns, professional play will be even more turtle based than it is right now.

So what can they possibly do? Revert everything and literally shit on professional play to satisfy the casual players or keep trying to figure out how to balance professional and casual play?

I honestly don't know what can possibly be done to accomplish this, but what comes to mind is that building has to be reworked entirely. Not how it works, but how it is used. If the game keeps favoring playing around forts, turtling will always be the most effective strategy to win.

I think Epic should leave some of the ""ego"" behind around the original idea of FORTnite and instead start adapting to how the game is wanted to be played by professionals, where aggressive playstyles are encouraged and building is mainly used as instant shielding/mobility instead of camping.

I'd like this sub to start brainstorming ideas to aid Epic instead of following /r/FortniteBR 's meta of posting complaints mindlessly.

I'm pretty average or below average. I don't have as much experience as many others here but I think I have enough to discuss the community response to the current meta. There has been a large outpouring of dissaproval for the ""just spray lol"" meta that began a week ago. Even after the nerfs the complaints seem to have gotten worse. Do you guys believe all the complaints are warranted?

It's not much but I generally survive to the last few circles and get to see beginning, middle, and end game. I have my fair share of wins. The spray and pray meta definitiely happens but it isn't nearly as prevalant nor destructive as the general fortnite reddit community makes it out to be. Many of the clips outraged at the meta that I see posted here can be chalked up as misplays against a player with an smg or minigun. 

In my matches if I run up against an smg/splode it's no problem to just hold my ground, if not temporarily slightly retreat then pop the guy trying to spray my walls. 

When I played other mmo's that had achieved these levels of success I saw the same thing happen to them that is currently happening to Fortnite. Tons of community input, sometimes misinformed( like the ""change the ""bug"" wall placement distance"" post), and a growing group of people voicing their disatisfaction with the game. All these games that became successful had a group of individuals who would come to the forums to voice their disatisfaction with the game, which was seen by the many lurkers there. The negativity spread like wildfire. Eventually those forums progressed into a toxic environment of people who just wanted to complain about the game rather than look for solutions. Reddit is by no means that bad but there are definitely elements of that toxicity.

Personally I feel that Fortnite could use a few drum gun/smg nerfs and slight mats buff to be in a healthy balance between weapon strength and build integrity. However, it seems like its not the best idea to revert back to the days where a 1v1 against a decent player meant using 1000 mats(as can be seen in the post earlier today ""remember build battles in season x"".  However we also dont want smgs to melt our walls in mere miliseconds. 

Ultimately, the reason I wrote up this essay of a post is to bring awareness to the fact that the vocal minority are making Fortnite appear to be in a much worse state than it is. The spray/splode meta is not nearly as bad as portrayed on reddit. I think that given a few more weeks people will learn how to counter the nerfed smgs and splodes( like not standing in one spot turbo building spamming walls but instead backing up and layering walls with ramps etc, see the ""this is fortnite..."" post) and ultimately the meta will level out to a place where builds and weapons are on an equal playing field, and where shotties and smgs are on a level playing field.

DeX allows you to hook your phone up to a monitor with a mouse and keyboard so it can basically be used as a computer. There has been the controversy with console and kb+m. I am curious what the community thinks about the idea that mobile players could use kb+m against touch screen users. 

I understand that this is fairly speculation at how it will play out but as of now it is confirmed to be available. 

Article below states that their sources have confirmed DeX support.

Obviously these two things aren't foolproof, but they should in theory work better than what you guys are doing.

The first one seems like a pretty obvious suggestion. If your not getting enough time to heal with a medkit, big pot, or chug, then stop using them. If your going to be fighting often in the middle of the map, priortize bandages, minis, ans slurps.

The second tip is only for situations where you're healing post fight. It might work mid-fight, but its far less likely to. Build your normal 1x1 with stairs, a floor, and a roof. Instead of healing on the bottom, go to the top and edit out your roof without confirming. This allows you full vision in between minis/bandages/etc. without exposing yourself. If you do see someone, simply edit out of the roof in their direction and start ramping. The only downside to this method is that you are vulnerable to attacks from the top. However, this should be countered by the fact that you can see your opponent before they see you.",FortniteCompetitive

In my humble opinion, the last 2 to 3 weeks of summer skirmish have proven to me that the EU scene is looking way more entertaining and professional than the NA scene. 

1)The average level of the EU player seems to be slightly higher. Now this doesn't mean NA doesn't have fantastic players, it does, but this is an AVERAGE. The gap between extremely good pros and streamers/not as good players in terms of skill level seems to be much wider, whereas in EU there are hardly any weak competitors. Take for example Loeya, whose performance didn't even land her a point yet she demonstrated very high skill that other NA girls can't hope to reach. 

2) EU players are way more aggressive, but also smarter. In my opinion, EU players were making better calls and rotations than NA players. Less people died to the storm, more people got 4+ kills compared to NA. And due to everyone's ability in EU, matches were way more entertaining to watch. 

3) Streamers are seen as the ""best"" in NA, whereas that's not the case in EU. In NA most people end up with disappointment where their favourite streamer who they call the best, for eg ninja, underperforms in a pro tourney. Now this isn't really the case in EU, it seems like EU is full of quote on quote real pros who are genuinely grinding and working on their own skill level, whereas NA streamers get a false sense of security from the ""you're the best at fortnite &lt;33"" comments, their massive following, and their content pub-stomping.

As we all know, the current meta influences players to spam guns like drum gun and p90 because they shred through builds so easily. This has obviously angered the community because the rate at which these weapons shred is ridiculous and it requires very little skill to do so.

This has altered how much skill is a factor in fights, which basically means a crap player is now much more capable of killing a very good player, this should not be the case.

**Why did epic make these changes?**

I ***Personally*** believe that epic made these changes for money. A large majority of this playerbase is bad at the game, so if you alter the game to cater to them, then it keeps them playing. If they keep playing, then its more likely that they will buy more skins and contribute to more fortnite events. Which is more money

NotVivid is a great player but just because he did well in these past couple games doesn't prove his the best as most people label him to be. Wait and see what he is capable of before labeling him something.

People used to label myth as the best player and now he constantly gets trash talked for ""falling off"", and then in the very same day people make posts about how he is popping off in the solo scrims. Daequan has constantly been highlighted as an incredible player, a couple games of him doing poorly (he was ill mind you) and now he should drop off and become a full time streamer instead of a pro player. But Kayuun did some great plays a couple times so he is definitely someone who should be in TSM right? Nothing against him mind you he definitely shows potential, but showing potential isn't enough. He should prove himself first. 

The best example I can give is Tfue. He has constantly and consistently proven himself to be one of the best players in the world but even he hasn't been dominating the summer skirmish scene. But we don't say anything about him because we know what he is capable of, he is an incredible player and we give him the benefit of the doubt because he has proven himself. Why don't we treat other players the same way? What benefit do we gain from bashing other pro players and telling them to drop off their respective team? Is our collective judgement so good that we can do the management of an e-sport organizations roster?

After a while when the stream view counter reached ~30k views they decided to host him.

Love watching competitive but hate how slow players play? Not entertaining to watch top 3 players with 1-2 kills while the 8 kill person dies at 5th-10th place?

Its time to stop the camp meta.Comp will not last long if it keeps the camp meta. 

**Gamemode**

The answer is simple.  Team Deathmatch / Rumble

First player/team to a certain amount of kills wins. (8-10 kills trigger victory) 

Or most kills within 15 minutes gets the Victory. Give points for 2nd and 3rd. 

Then give the bonus money to whoever had most kills in the tournament.

Make it Blitz rules- First circle already shown, Double the mat rate, More launch pads, bounce pads and traps.
Watch your favorite players go off. Shorter faster paced games with plenty of quick engagements. 

You get nothing for camping or turtling. 

**SMG's/Minigun**

Also a note on how i think Subs would be balance. Reduce the clip in the P90 to 40 and remove headshot multipliers on SMGs    if they are designed to destroy mats, then let them do that, but a couple of 40HP headshots are too deadly.  
Make them kings of building destroying but let shotguns be more viable in the shortrange. Making the subs do a base damage without headhsots reduces the flukey, shred times. They will still kill quick but not as loony as if you connect with headshots.   Give the mini gun the same no HS multiplier. and give it a slower firerate while it overheats. that way it never stops you from shooting but slows to half paced after 100 rounds, obviously the rate of fire or when it slows could be tweaked. 

Also reduce drum gun to 40 ammo



I think these would be great changes to the comp scene. Epic could even make a gamemode like this solely for comp playing and add a ranking system to it. 


**TL;DR **  Use blitz rules and make it Team deathmatch rules. Most kills wins and reduce the spam guns letahlity. Fast paced, kill fest.

So discussion time, how would your future competitors stop the turtling without the spam meta and explosives being so strong?

While the shotgun META was amazing for Solos and normal ques it was not ideal for pro play, turtling was at it's high and was impossible to even have a chance to fight someone, the spam meta as unfun as it is, helped a lot with it.

I have seen some popular suggestions such as:

* Capping material to 500, while increasing harvesting and/or give extra material when eliminating a player.

* Removing turbo building

* Limiting the number of structures placed on the same space/Unit, this would nerf turtling but also would nerf boxing yourself. (This would only work with SMG structure damage nerf)

* IMHO, there is absolutely no way to change the turtling meta with the Placement over kills format. What I mean by this is as long as placements is guarantee more points than kills teams/players will always find a way to stay defensive and turtle themselves for a garantee high placement, this is a very BR type of strategy and goes back to the first ever BR game.


So should Epic give up on trying to nerf turtling with the spam or explosives and work on their format or should they find a different way?

The problem is compounded by the fact that when you kill someone, they also have less ammo because they haven't been looting ammo boxes either.

Maybe this should include the drum gun that uses medium bullets?

Just a thought, this would put the minigun as the best spam weapon again and the smgs more in their place which is fast time to kill close range.

The game has evolved throughout its time so much its unbelievable and the skill ceiling is always rising because of new mechanics, new ways of playing etc. Rocket league is so popular because of this, there is always something new to learn, some new move to master and its amazing (coupled with the GREAT ranked mode).

So when we look at what made fortnite such a popular game, its obviously building. Looking through the evolution of building it follows the same pattern as new mechanics in rocket league. Compared to the start, building has evolved so much, it used to be only used for quick cover to shoot from, then it became a way of fighting where the mechanics started to evolve, pyramids used to be useless or used instead of stairs but now it has a spot of its own and anyone who can use them effectively has the upper hand. I think if building wasn't nerfed so much and there wouldn't be smg's or drum guns that make those walls look so punny the games skill ceiling would rise exponentially. But it wont, and epic don't want it to become that way, I don't know the reasons and I cant explain this weird balancing but the AMAZING potential of this wonderfully crafted game is diminishing.

Epic, I urge you to reconsider your balancing decisions and think about this long term, because in my eyes, the higher the skill ceiling, the longer your game will be played.

P.S this is not an ""Ebic pls!!1!"" post, I just wanted to share my views on the games direction and I hope you guys understand where I'm coming from

Myth is at the very top of the game and has never dropped from there. He just clearly does not try in pubs, at all. I see him leave auto sprint on whilst reading chat for 20-30 seconds or going to get food etc, he does not care about pubs so stop judging him by that. He is putting in mad amounts of work scrimming solos and doing playground 1v1s with the Liquid lads and he performs really well in everything I just said which means A LOT.

This narrative is not edgy, you don't know more than everyone else with your insight.

They are getting better and better and I look forward to them all week but they prove something that this subreddit has been talking about for awhile. 

If Epic has any clue at all they must now know that they can ABSOLUTELY NOT nerf the material gain. I literally watch Courage hit bookshelves and fences for fifteen minutes in a single game and he still ended up low on mats by the time he died. The casters were bringing up how low players were on mats literally every fight, and the players are already spending the first 3-4 circles hitting trees and rocks. They are trying to make Summer Skirmishes faster paced by making them kill based, but nerfing material gain will be counter intuitive because then players will spend even more time just hitting trees and not fighting. Not to mention even more so every fight will just be decided by who ran out of materials faster. I think resource management is as important of a skill as everything else in this game but already players are often running out of materials, if they lower the cap or nerf material gain to cater even heavier to casual players these pro matches will be unplayable. Epic, please stop trying to handicap the players that took the time to learn how to build.",FortniteCompetitive

I am not good at this game, and a lot of other people aren’t either. I look at /r/FortniteBR and /r/FortniteCompetitive and I can’t even relate to these posts about the shotgun delay because I physically don’t have the reflexes to switch to shotguns that fast. I’m also willing to bet that there are also many others that are just as bad as me, and we all get completley mowed down by people who are extremely good at this game.

I know the obvious answer is to play more, but I also don’t have the time or even want to invest a large amount of time to really delve into the game to get better. I play around 8 hours a week.

I personally do not think it is fun to kill a mobile player who can’t build a wall, or get killed by someone who builds completely around me and uses his master editing skills to open a window and kill me before I even see him.

My personal thoughts are that there should be a Competitive mode that assigns skill rating to accounts. Playing against players that are my skill level would be incredibly enjoyable and not so rage-inducing.

The responses vehemently suggested I stop playing solo squads. Over the next two days I grinded 14 hours of solo squads and got my first solo squad victory with an 8 bomb where I pushed everyone and played really aggressive. I dropped either tilted, el paso (mini desert tilted) paradise, lazy or valhalla only (depending where bus was). I get 2-4 kills every game now and I am getting better at fighting four people at once. I improved more in the last week grinding solo squads than I have in the previous three months. 

I get one gun, 100 mats and then I try to kill everyone I see as aggro as possible. This is not what I was advised to do, I was told to play for the win every game. Fuck winning I said, I play to improve. If I'm out in a field and 4 people are on a hill, I push them. This is how to improve, not play solos or squads and play like a coward. ",FortniteCompetitive

Instead, I'd like to start a thread where we can post three players we believe will either win or place very high with a description of why.

I'll start, and keep it interesting by naming players most of you probably aren't that aware of:

\#1 Twitch\_ Ranger - As far as I know, he's yet to play in a summer skirmish and I firmly believe he is among the top 5 or 10 best players in the world. Insane stats, building, aim, all of it. I've died to him twice personally and I have never felt so outclassed against anyone.

\#2 Twitch Nolanlul - I mod on a Discord FN league and get to grade vods of the winning teams. I'll sometimes watch the top teams to see how their players do, and this guy has always impressed me. Not to mention, he's rocking a 59% WR with a 17 KD for solos in season four with 325+ matches played. 

\#3 CoL Hogman - I realize i'm probably biased on this one since I've been a CoL fanboy since their HoN team won the big tournaments back in '14-'15, but this dude has a ton of scrim experience and is definitely a solid player. As the captain for CoL, he'll likely make smart decisions that will result in him living til the final circles and potentially getting points for landing in top 3.

That's my three, what about you guys?

That's ridiculous and most of you were only able to do it because of OHK pump and animation cancelling.

Time to earn some money boys.

Following on from last week, where SkyBet put excellent odds on top players, I won £100 on a £2 bet on Zayt and Saf last week, and almost won £680 on a bet on Liquid, this week provides just as many shocks.

Each way terms: 1/4 for first 3 places.

Ninja comes in as the favourite at 4/1 (That's just ridiculous).

Not all players have been added yet as it seems they've not added the showdown performers (no Chap or 72hrs), but POACH and Strafe are both there at 40/1. Imagine a world where you can put a bet on Poach or Strafe and get 10x the amount of money you'd get than Ninja,

Tips:

Ghost Saf - 250/1 WHAT THE FUCK - Saf is the same odds as Kittyplays

Tfue - 10/1

Poach - 40/1

Strafe - 40/1

Daequan - 20/1 

HighDistortion - 25/1 

Ghost Bizzle - 40/1

Nick Eh 30 - 50/1

That said, the smg/spam meta is ruining 1vX fights, and here's why. In the spam meta, since building is so easily shredded, 1vX fights are no longer determined by the he difference in skill between the Solo player and the squad, but rather a skill cutoff that the squad has to reach. For example, take a squad of let's say 3kd players vs a 4kd player. Obviously the squad will win, as they should - the solo will get simply outgunned. However, take that same squad vs a 15kd player - the outcome will still be the same. No matter how good the solo is, four competent opponents can simply shred through building from different angles. And here lies the problem, due to the meta of spraying builds, 1vX fights are no longer determined by the skill gap between players but instead by only if the squad is competent. The same concept applies to pinches in solos, which presents imo the biggest problem with the meta right now - outplays are no longer skill based in many situations.",FortniteCompetitive

        Towards the end of season 4 Epic made a post saying they wanted to diversify their game allow different playstyles.
Haven't they done just that? No weapon is a necessity anymore:
shotguns can be substituted for smgs and dual pistols 
ARs can be substituted for scoped, thermal, supressed smg or even deagle
Loadouts are more diverse than ever and you can choose to run so many things other than Healing , AR , 2 shotties and snipe/splode which was pretty standard and repetitive for multiple seasons.
(Long post ik)
Also gameplay wise, with rifts and ATKs the game allows you to choose your landing spot more than ever, be risky and land a highly congested spot and come out with 5+ kills and plenty of weapons 
Or
Land somewhere safe maybe pick up 1/2 kills and get 200 hp with average loadout with plenty of ammo and materials 
Both allow easy rotation to the zone (majority of the time) without feeling time constricted.

It's harder to get used to because you have so many buttons to manage but because of this pro players are extremely good when they master all the movements and techniques. Controllers are obviously way easier to learn with even if you are using a elite controller which only took me about 3-5 days to  get good with. We all know the downsides to using a controller. Aiming is more difficult and you have to double tap buttons or click and hold in order build which takes more time then playing on MnK. Also for the people that don't have elite controllers, they have to take there finger of the joysticks. 

As someone who has played PC lobbies, crossplay lobbies, and console lobbies there is the tiniest of difference between the 3. Honestly the only real difference I have noticed between the lobbies are when I run into people that can build like streamers. If you not building and editing as fast as pros there is someone on console that is just as good as you. I drop 5-10 kill games in all three lobbies, I usually average about 1-3 kills in all three lobbies, and I die right off the bat every once in a while in all three lobbies.

I think those points have been exhausted several times over on here (bloom battles, anti-push, difficult to 1vX etc.)  and although I agree, I would like to point out why console gameplay is even dumber than PC currently. I'll try to keep it short.

1) Aim Assist, AA is ridiculously strong in this game which means there isn't a significant skill gap between players spraying SMGs at each other as it practically locks on to a player if your reticle is in the general vicinity and you ADS.

2) Tracking is very difficult on console while moving and hipfiring. The game felt much smoother when centered around shotguns as it was more about flicks and precision rather than constantly following an enemy while holding down trigger. It may have added a new skill facet actually but one thats not really suited to a controller.

3) Editing is fucking horrible. When you are boxed in against a spammer, they have to be pretty bad to let you escape because it takes forever to edit and often bugs out that you have exit build mode and re-enter to be able to edit again. The spam is certainly a issue on PC but good players can often reset or buy themselves time by editing efficiently, on console there is barely any room for error.

4) Not being able to switch to the weapon you need. This is related to the boxed in issue above. Since you can't edit out, you often are forced to take a 50-50 fight against 3rd party Johnny who is spamming your heal box. Upon exiting build mode console players can't immediately switch to the weapon they need and have to scroll through the inventory to get to their shotgun/spamgun. Pulling off quick heals in between reloads sucks because their often isn't enough time anymore to get back to a gun before Johnny breaks into the box. This issue again is mitigated on PC as it allows specific weapon binds which means PC players can react quicker and take a 50-50 fight in an instant where on console we need a little breathing space to get our shit in order before taking a 50-50.

TLDR: Spam meta sucks but sucks even more on console due to the reasons listed above.",FortniteCompetitive

The gameplay on console is terrible and potentially the worst it's ever been. There's been no major improvements to help improve some of the issues and the new meta has the game going in the right direction (in my opinion). 

1. Performance issues - Epic hasn't made any adjustments to fix the constant bugs that console players are running into. Whether it's the game not rendering at the beginning of games, CONSTANT hitches and freezes during games or ping spikes (30 --&gt; 100, 200 and at one point, I had 1,300 ping). These are just a few that I've run into and they're all nearly unplayable. They can't be controlled by better internet or monitors. I've ran a monitor on console since I started playing and I've ran a wired connection the entire time. 

2. No console gameplay improvements - What update has console received since Builder Pro that did us any favors? 

- We can't edit quickly or efficiently, our builds don't place properly (too far, not at all, etc.), we're constantly Harry Pottered (new patch + 60 FPS in build battles + hitching). 

- Aim assist still bugs out when you have multiple enemies next to each other (tracking with hunting, AR's). 

- No building sensitivity

- Bouncers/Campfires/Launchpads CONSTANTLY switching to traps and placing


3. KB &amp; M and Xim - Epic allows them, can't do much about them. Still trash to use on console. 

4. The new meta - The reason you don't see console players build? Why would they? You can just hold forward and the RT. You literally just shoot through walls and builds. In a bad player vs. bad player fight, it's just who can hit more bloom shots. Bad player vs. medium player, bad player probably lands shots, but might die due to positioning, etc. Good player vs. bad player, good player wins 7/8 out of 10 times, but it's near impossible to not take damage on console. It's extremely repetitive right now and it goes like this... you run into a player, they shoot out your builds and just spam until their clip runs out. Rinse and repeat. Epic has narrowed the skill gap and eliminated the need to ever build and if you manage to get close to someone, you can just barrel stuff somebody by walking through their builds. This is due in large part to the recent nerfs to wood starting health. I could go on for a while about the meta, but you guys have already heard it all. The spam meta is extremely annoying. 

I'm probably missing some things in here, but in my opinion, the game has not got any better for console players since Builder Pro. It's been much worse lately. Epic keeps bringing back novelty items like jetpacks and the homing missile instead of focusing on improvements to any of things I mentioned above. I hope some of these issues can be fixed soon because Fortnite has been fun for so long and the game is starting to lose that fun.

Lastly, I just want to address anyone who says I might be overreacting. I've played 307 matches this season and won 134 games. Even as a skilled console player, the game is getting stale and repetitive. I really hope it changes soon. ",FortniteCompetitive

I'd say at the moment, mine are 


1. High Distortion. Dude is just a pubstomper.

2. Ninja. I know he sounds so cliche but he is a beast when he's on the roll, and have found he can build great when needed, but also great at knowing when to disengage a build fight.

3. NickMercs, mainly because he's a console player like I am, and even though he may not be the best builder, this dude slays out consistently. His aim is off the charts, and he plays on 6/6, which I switched from my 7/7 to 6/6 and has vastly improved my pubstumping because I found I was sacrificing good aim for fast builds. I wonder how good he'd be if he got used to 7/7 or higher lol.


I watch so many so it's hard to even decide. Obviously if this was for scrims, then my list would be diff as Liquid boys would take up my top 3 lol.

Which built more and comparison of the Pro's Build Fights.,"After seeing some of the post on the top of /r/FortniteCompetitive talking about the differences between console lobbies and pc lobbies, I decided I would take a look at the 1st and 2nd place finishers for Week 2 Summer Skirmish, iDropz_Bodies and FaZe Cloakzy.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etF6HymHkfQ51g0Y-EcJ5tqZkwZvsuyjXE0ofNN_GI4/edit?usp=sharing

While there aren't many ways to quantify player skill in Fortnite other than looking at stats, I decided to look at how many players built at all after being shot at by the pro player. This is the easiest way I could think about to determine how many bad players the pro ran up against. 

If a person doesn't build at all, that means:
 
1. The Pro does in turn not need to spend many resources to kill that player.

2. The Pro spends significantly less time killing the player, allowing him to chase after other kills.

________

Through watching the VODS I have determined a few things about the matches:

(O) = Observational Opinion

(F) = Statistical Fact
#**We should note that these observations are strictly about the games I watched and may not accurately reflect the entirety of the player base of the console**

1. (O) The players in iDropz_Bodies lobbies were significantly worse than the players in Cloakzy's lobby when it came to building after being shot at during the mid to late game.

2. (O) The quality of build fights in iDropz_Bodies lobbies were worse than the players in Cloakzy's lobby. (See Build Fights Links)

3. (F) iDropz_Bodies killed more people in the first 3 minutes of the game than Cloakzy, but killed just as many in the mid &amp; late game.

4. (F) iDropz_Bodies killed more people who never built in 3 1/2 games than Claozky did in his 10 games.

______

##TL;DR

Significantly more people built at least 1 ramp, wall, or floor when faced up against Cloakzy on PC than PS4 players built against iDropz_Bodies but iDropz_Bodies did not stream/save the VODs of most of his games. In my opinion, the quality of build fights was higher on PC.

 | iDropz_Bodies | FaZe Cloakzy
---|---|----
Built | 50.70% (36) | 72.50% (87)
Did not build | 49.30% (35) | 27.50% (33)

Console on the other hand, good players and really good players aren't separated by that big of a skill gap. Aim assist, non instant editing, etc makes it seem as if they are harder opponents than they actually are. 

And console players tend to judge their gameplay against pro pc players which is an obvious fail logically ",FortniteCompetitive

I averaged 5KD but had a really low winrate (3%) which I attributed to poor aim in late game situations, so I decided to make a change with my sensitivity after doing some research. 

I bought a QcK+ mousepad and have lowered sensitivity to 400DPI/0.10 ingame a couple of days ago. I'm having a ton of trouble adjusting overall, as I'm slow to build and even aim now, averaging less than 1KD since. My wrist is also hurting a lot as I feel like putting a lot of pressure on it trying to compensate for the lack of sensitivity (I'm used to using pretty much just my wrist for everything mouse related due to tiny desk space in the past). I feel like I'm doing something wrong so I'm looking on any tips how to adjust.

I also realized I hold my mouse like [this](https://i.imgur.com/hDv6B6B.jpg), which probably isnt good for low sensitivity. What kind of arm placement should I be looking at?

Without cross-platform competitions, everyone is coming into the game on (mostly) equal footing. Minus kbm on console (which I don't believe is nearly as prevalent as people think) the only thing that is separating people is individual skill and RNG, which skill counters in a lot of ways. The reason there's a lot of console players in the leaderboards is because there's a lot of console players. Period. I'd bet my left nut Epic knows this and that's why they're not concerned with making things like Solo Showdown platform-specific. 

What I DO believe is that if and when we see more cross-platform competitions with PC players and console players in the same lobby, PC players would generally rank much higher than their console opponents. Assuming a perfect scenario where two players with exactly the same skill, guns, etc get in a fight, I see the PC player winning those the majority of the time due to limitations of controller input.

Thoughts?

P.S. Even if Epic doesn't separate prizing for Solo Showdown, it would be nice if they had leaderboards to show who the best Xbox, PS4, PC, etc players are. Or at least make it clearly visible. If I was on Switch and got 230th place but the highest ranking on their platform I would like to know, regardless of prizing.",FortniteCompetitive

**Buff its strengths and nerf its weaknesses**

What makes the pump unique as a shotgun was its ability to burst someone with a well placed headshot, its weakness has always been with its small mag size. With double pump however, its weaknesses no longer existed and that's what made the gun imbalanced.

Thinking of a solution I thought about this and essentially what it is to have a ranked sort of system. So what epic would need to do is that in the next solo showdown type of gamemode they would need to track your amount of wins and kill to death ratio and then determine everyone into a group. This would make it so that there would be two solos (causal and ranked) where you would be matched with similar players and then you would actually feel like you spent your time well. Also another concept is to increase the amount of damage a wall is,  bring back peaking through edits, double shotgun,mat collection speed and other advanced techniques. ",FortniteCompetitive

I actually like that smg's a a viable secondary weapon, but yes I agree they might be too strong. (drum gun is an smg btw, so falls under the same category.

I think a nerf to the damage smg's do to structures would be a good way to go about it. This would still make smg's a good followup weapon after a shotgun, without completely nerfing them to where we won't use them.

In pro games the storm needs to close in on multiple smaller circles instead of 1 big circle. 


Why?


Because it solves the problem of campy, slow paced games that lag with 40 people in a tiny circle. 


How? 


Pros don't avoid fights because they are scared of a fight. They avoid them because of fear of being third partied. To fix this force smaller groups of players together multiple times, before forcing the last teams or players together for the finale. If players are comfortable with there backs to the storm they can focus on the enemies in their small zone.





Basically this removes the edge of zone camping that makes pro games kinda lackluster. There is a lot of things to consider about exactly how to make the change to the storm circles and that's what we can figure out together.


Some things to consider include:


How many smaller zones should there be and how should they form?




Should storm damage be relative to the position of the zone?




Should players be able to build and or jump over the parts of the storm zones?



Should the final zone close in all the way or leave room for a fight?

All shotguns should be aimed to around that level of effective imo, to encourage ""diverse playstyle"" rather than the current SMG-centric meta. If each individual shotguns can perform like the Heavy does now, there isn't even a need to introduce double shotguns for balance. 

Heavy could, perhaps get a slight buff after balancing the other two shotguns. To be fair, with the tighter cross-hair, landing those full 10 pellet shots actually takes a bit of aim.

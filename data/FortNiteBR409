--2.3 i7

--16gb ram

--Nvidia 750M 2gb (forced, I have two graphics cards)

At first this was unplayable.  There are still some major problems, but I got it going.

--Settings &gt; audio &gt; quality = low

--Settings &gt; video &gt; epic &gt; apply

Then go to lobby

--Settings &gt; video &gt; low &gt; anti-aliasing &gt; medium &gt; apply

Go back to lobby and play

I have tried a ton of combinations, this seems to work the best.

Side note——- if your character does not look blurry try the steps again.  I believe that the settings are not staying set, and bumping up quality after you hit save.

Now there is a bug for sure, when you mess with these settings a 10+ times or join squad things get weird.

I normally get about 100fps in lobby, but even doing above I get 55 FPS in lobby. When this happens I restart the game and go through the process above.  Usually fixes it.

You still lag jumping from the bus and — loading new areas you have never been or new situations you have not seen — but for the most part playable.

Maybe you will find this helpful...and maybe epic (awesome by the way) will catch this.

One last thing you will notice.  If you only select “low” video quality and click apply, then go to lobby and return to settings.  Video quality low is no longer selected ( all the buttons below it are, but the low button is not), this is a change from pre 2.2.0.

Does anyone else have some tricks?

Hey, I got my first W with these  settings so it can be done!!

--Player: manumoomoo

--Servers: US

--Lag location: basically everywhere, mostly deploying shoot and reloading new areas of map

--Platform: OS X


OS X, I know—I know.  If you have any other input or help please post here.  Maybe it will help Epic!  

Thanks again Epic for a great game!

I was super excited to play 2.2 but discovered that the lag I experience since updating to 2.2 is nearly unbearable after jumping from the bus. my FPS drops to 1-2 and then after several moments on the ground it returns nearly to my FPS cap. 30.

Prior to 2.2 in 2.1 I never dropped below my cap of 30 fps.

Everything in the game was perfect. The weapon balancing, the sniping (yup my bullets went through plenty of players) the rockets, the holiday updates. It all came together.

Yeah there were some hitches (as I said above) along the way, a few things that needed fixing, but that is expected.  And I have to admit, being a gamer for my whole life (30+ years) you have restored my faith in a world where developers just want more and more money.  

Yeah, I spent upwards of 100$ in the game already.  But it is OPTIONAL.  I didn’t have to purchase anything and I still could have had the same amount of fun.  The bigger statement here is that the $ I spent, was WELL WORTH IT for what we have gotten so far.  The community feedback and interaction with us players is second to none.... oh and The black knight and shadow ops are amazing btw 

You guys have truly outdone yourselves with his update.  It feels exactly like the same FNBR I have played for so many hours, but in the same breath, it feels like a completely different game, and that game is amazing.  I have had 0 performance issues, no stutters, no lag, no major issues at all since this update. 

The new map and textures look insanely crisp and gorgeous.  The wooded areas look lush and look like it should.  The new swamps and trees look brilliant. The new cities and POI’s are very well made.  I can tell that a lot of hard work went into making this update what it is. A perfect refreshing update to FNBR.  

Updates like this usually cost 19.99.  They aren’t free.  Updates like this usually are not as complete or as robust.  In this fact, I truly thank you. 

I applaud everyone at EPIC.  You guys have really outdone yourselves with this update. It’s everything I never knew I wanted in this game, but somehow, you found a way to balance it all, and breathe new life, into a game, where life was already thriving. 

A sort of TLDR;

THANK YOU EPIC.  You have something really special on your hands, know it, and aren’t blinded by the success. It means a lot knowing that anything you guys and gals do to this game will be great. I plan on logging another 500+ hours, and I can’t wait to see what more the future holds.

This flaw is sniping. Epic Games has now added a distance to how far you have sniped someone and displays it on the kill feed. This gives an unfair advantage to the team getting sniped because they can now pin point a location of where someone got sniped from. Epic needs to fix this!,FortNiteBR
20,HavocDefused,1516334447,7rfoxc,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7rfoxc/west_coast_servers_desperately_needed/,4,West Coast servers Desperately Needed!,"Hello everyone, I am making this thread out of sheer frustration that many west coast players have for the laggy encounters in FortniteBR. I should mention I play on the Ps4 console and have run into very similar scenarios on pc. The ping in California is in the 90's at best, it doesn't matter what your isp is and the average ping in Washington is 115. Meanwhile everyone on the east coast, and Midwest, and south have around 50 pings on average due to the servers being in Virginia and Ohio. In this thread, I will link multiple videos showing just how frustrating this lag can be and how ridiculous it looks on my screen. I understand lag and ping can be an issue for any gamer but when connection completely dictates the outcome of every close engagement this becomes beyond tolerable. Most of you are thinking well you probably have terrible internet , I can assure you my internet (Charter Communications) not only has great bandwidth of 200 down and 20 up, but by far the best networking in my area for latency.
Fortnite servers are supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS), and when looking at CloudPing.info, this is what shows up.

US-East (Virginia)
100 ms
US East (Ohio)
112 ms
US-West (California)
35 ms
US-West (Oregon)
48 ms

You can clearly see how the addition of the servers on the west coast would help tremendously. For any serious gamer out there the difference is obvious when playing on 100 ping as oppose to 35/48.
Before you view these clips I do not claim to be the best player or even a great player that's not what I am here for, I am here to show how terrible the lag can get for us west coast players and how desperately we need servers if we wish to continue playing this game.

(ALL CLIPS ARE IN REPLY BELOW)

CLIP#1
In this clip I take 90 damage form a pump shotgun that clearly misses me if you pause at 0:05 seconds you can see the whole pump spread completely miss me. The threat indicator clearly shows I am taking damage from the person which doesn't even have line of sight on me.
Pause at 0:05 

CLIP#2
In this clip I am clearly behind cover at around 20 seconds and I immediately get shot through the built ramp as if i were standing on the side of it.

CLIP # 3
In this clip I backed up the left behind cover and you can see the bullet hit the air next to me and still end up killing me.

Clip # 4

In this clip I jump to the left to become a harder target for my enemy and see the bullet wiz past me at the bottom right of my corner where I was positioned moments ago and still take full damage as if my character is still there.
Pause at 0:12


I know most of you are thinking “well this only happens every now and then it isn't any reason to stop playing the game”. Without exaggeration I can honestly say, this happens more than once per game it is the number 1 way I die. I honestly could make a 30 min montage of clips like this. This isn’t fair to your west coast players at all and I will be playing fortnite considerably less until this gets fixed. If you are a west coast fortnite player and are experiencing similar issues I encourage you to upload your clip and share it, Epic needs to make this a priority and your involvement can help this issue become one.

So during the Christmas bush period, bushes we're updated to be partially transparent for the user when aiming the sniper rifle (the bush would be around the scope) or over the shoulder partially removing a piece of the bush - so you can see where you're aiming.

But with this latest update, it seems (at least on PS4) that it's back to the pre-Christmas state.

Some of the bugs are:
-Game freezes for 10-15 sec after jumping out of the bus (you basically can’t control where you land now)
-fps lag spikes almost constantly
-no crosshair on scoped weapons

As enticing as money is, games like H1Z1, swtor, or even Minecraft have proven that ignoring the future of the game, and only focusing on getting as much money as possible NOW, is truly bad for a game if it plans to remain relevant and fun for a long time. Right now, the game needs a serious rework, A.K.A. recoil replacing bloom, and the head glitching that has plagued this game from it's release, and now the new map glitches.

Great Job, Epic!","THIS is what I felt was lacking in the vanilla game. Finally, we have a POI that is so very different, that brings something totally new, and that feels large enough that it feels like its own little world.

I loved places like Retail Row or Pleasant Park, but the truth is, they tend to feel similar when you see Pleasant's recycled houses, or Retail Row's basic layout.

But Tilted Towers introduces vertical gameplay, complex building design, and a feeling of playing something much grander than any other POI in this game. It feels like a giant step forward from the vanilla POIs, and it feels as if Epic put a lot of effort into its design, flow, and complexity.

--

Areas like Shifty Shafts also brings about a very fun CQC playstyle. Snobby Shores also has refreshing building design for what is another suburban POI. 

What makes me most excited is that it's clear Epic has learned a lot with designs like Tilted and Shifty, and I am so excited for a new map (whenever that comes), because I can only hope their level design is going to be as creative.

From the unique houses, to the large buildings, to the biome's distinctions, the entire map really feels like its finally at a finished state, but Tilted Towers specifically evokes a unique feeling that I'm going to remember fondly like playing Sidewinder on Halo, or Arica Harbour on Bad Company 2.

First of all, I hate the colour changes. I get that they were going for some sort of divide between the 2 halves of the map, however it seems just kinda shit. Going from the game being super vibrant to being pretty dark on one side of the map and then just completely dark green on the other is just a huge step down visually for me. Honestly its comparable to H1Z1, going from a nice vibrant colour scheme to one that just looks plain dark green and nothing else.


I would just recommend they change back to the old colours, IMO the entire game is a bit of an eye sore now, compared to a few hours ago where it looked pretty damn nice even with shadows and shit turned down.



Next is the position of the landmarks. Whether or not they are planning to add more landmarks on to the right side, its just a stupid decision IMO. Jam packing the west side of the map with countless landmarks and leaving the east of the map with just a few landmarks isn't great. Pair this with the fact that the west side of the map has a straight up DARK GREEN colour scheme due to this stupid divide thing they have done, its just shit. I've landed at tilted towers a few times and found myself thinking ""wow the landscape genuinely looks like fucking garbage"" since its just a dark green carpet now.



For anyone trying to defend the fact that they jam packed the west of the map, think about it. It doesn't matter how much loot balancing you do, one side of the map is bare, the other is jam packed with landmarks. And even if they are planning on releasing some new landmarks on the east of the map, surely it would have been better to add all of the landmarks at the same time to stop the east side of the map dying until they add them?




TDLR:


I think the game looks like shit now if i'm completely honest. It's gone from vibrant textures that are actually appealing to a dark green and DARK DARK GREEN carpet on either side of the map. Jam packing the west side of the map with landmarks and leaving the east side bare in comparison is retarded.

It does decent healing in a relatively quick amount of time.  My issue is that it's rarely ""in play"".

What I mean by that is that unlike the launch pad, you rarely have time to react to it when you see it on the battlefield.  

The launch pad is a joy because it allows us to react to it.  Sometimes there's one randomly set up on the ground on our way to the next circle.   Sometimes we see people set theirs up too early and we can take it out from afar.   Sometimes we see that someone has the potential to launch pad in our base, so we set up spike traps inside.  It creates a wonderfully dynamic battlefield. 

The Campfire feels like a missed opportunity.  Rarely, if ever, do I see it set up and have the time to react to it.  It feels like a very quiet item that doesn't change the game up in an exciting or dynamic way.  I mean, we currently have 6, count them 6 (!) quiet healing items.  It feels like we should only have 5 quiet ones, and one interesting one.

Does anyone else agree?  And if so, what do you think could be done to change the item?  The only thing I got would be to make it emit smoke so you have to think about where the safest place to place it would be.

My health 100, my shield full power

I've braved through 90 other deaths

'Til 10 remain, to face the test


&amp;nbsp;



I see two morons by the Lake

They see each other,  but hesitate

Two shots ring out across the water

Two victims of a sniper's slaughter


&amp;nbsp;

Another base is building high

But the fury of the storm is nigh

The circle starts to move again

As luck would have it, I'm still in


&amp;nbsp;


Two more are lost within the storm

Six sneaky bois are left to swarm

As the rival builder abandons ship

A Christmas bush unloads his clip


&amp;nbsp;

We're down to 5 , my mouse is sweaty

My knees are weak, arms are heavy

""_I'm about to finally win Mom_,

_Fuck your spaghetti!_ ""


&amp;nbsp;

At once a sound I dread to hear

Fills my hallowed halls with fear

A rocket screeches my direction

Obliterates my bottom section


&amp;nbsp;

My fort comes crashing to the ground

But I spot the bastard and fire a round

He's down, he's down, his loot is mine

A medkit, rockets, and a golden shine


&amp;nbsp;


I take a moment to admire the weapon

A golden sniper in my possession

I spot a target, the inaugural shot

And down goes Frazier, bravely fought


&amp;nbsp;


Now three remain, no more no less

Myself and two others, the best of the best

A fight breaks out across the map

A shotgun blast,  *rat tat tat*


&amp;nbsp;


My heart rate spikes, we're down to two

I go to attack, but before I do

I spot some cover, a lonely shack

And into it, I plan my track


&amp;nbsp;


One more shield is all I need

I'll sneak inside and drink with speed

I step into the door, but *ZAP*

Extends the spikes out from a trap


&amp;nbsp;

Players could hide inside old buildings to catch others off guard. Also, they would know if a ramp up the side of the mountain was recently built or from early game. 

Maybe every circle change they age one step so you could have an idea about how old they are.

So at the very start, every building and outside will have husks that indiscriminately attack players, and as the game progresses, random teleporters or portals, lightning bolts that come down once the Storm appears can spawn more up or something and spawn more in. They'll destroy buildings to get to players. Maybe they'll start off with 50 HP, then as the game progresses with each circle, new ones will gain 25 HP. I'm thinking just standard husks would be best, otherwise it'd be a bit too messy, be more like the PvE with 99 other people.

This may be extra taxing on PCs, though, but I think it'd be super fun :) Fighting off zombie like creatures as well as players. Skilled players can use the Husks to their advantage, or players who are good at hiding can use them to draw away any attention, and as you fight off Husks it can draw in more players who hear the gunshots. I guess it'd make silenced weapons very useful to help keep your location a bit more unknown.

I haven't played the PvE, so I'm not exactly the most experience on how Husks work, but anyone who does might be able to help fill me in :) Unless this is an awful idea, in which case feel free to let me know too.",FortNiteBR

For the record I’m playing on PS4 and this is the first BR game I’ve ever played. 




Wouldn’t be right to not start by congratulating the developers of having the insight to make this extremely fun game. I Love the art style and overall goofy theme. I do have some feedback/complaints though and here they are. 




1) My single biggest issue with the game is the gunplay, it’s not good. This game is super competitive for some people and all the weapons seem really inconsistent (pump shotgun to the grill for 6 damage, then you get snipe by one from 25 meters away). I think it stems from the “bloom” or the way recoil is handled. I think they should shy away from bloom and just had more kick to the guns like horizontal, vertical, and first shot recoil this change would eliminate the random bullet deviation and add more skill. Look at the way the Battlefield series has handed this issue. I shouldn’t  be winning or losing my gunfights based of RNG bloom. 




2) Progression! I like the daily challenges and they need to be expanded plus addd some weekly and possibly a monthly. I think rewards should be given for winning matches. Either the currency that buys skins, or separate cosmetics like we have seen in other Reddit post ie. Bronze glider for 10 wins, silver for 25 wins etc. This would greater increase the satisfaction of winning and provide players with a true sense of pride and accomplishment. Reward good players. 





3) The pickaxe or harvesting tool should do more damage. It really sucks to be completely helpless because your house or drop location didn’t have a weapon. Plus it would be a good way to conserve ammo if your feeling risky. 10 damage is way to little, and I think it should be buffed to 25 or even 24 for a 5 hit. This change would make getting out of a bad spawn possible. 





4) Dropping weapons and mats should be easier and be able to do with a single button for items in hotbar. 




5) Every gun should have bullet drop, not just the sniper. More skillful and hopefully we can get ride of hit-scan entirely. 




Well that’s all I can think of now, so far having a blast but it can be frustrating sometimes  with the current state of the gunplay and no rewards. What do you guys think?

I get that bushes are a big part of the culture here, but can we please do something to make the people sitting inside them more visible.

This post isn't coming from a place of wanting my hand held, or wanting the game to be easier. It's a straight up matter of bush campers having an unfair advantage. I cannot understand for the life of me how it's reasonable or fair to allow bad players to cloak themselves completely in one of thousands of bushes in the game. There are buildings to hide in, there is the option to build yourself a building to hide in, yet you put bushes in the game to hand hold the people who lack to ability to play offensively, or play smarter? Come on. That is absolutely ridiculous.

If I have a 10 kill game and am approaching the final few circles, why should I be punished with a pump shotgun to the face from some invisible scrub who has 0 kills, and full shield?

Please, Epic. Make the bushes smaller. Make them rustle when somebody is sitting in one, give them SOME disadvantage, please.

I get that some people just really want one more kill on their stats. And I definitely get it/have done it myself *if* I actually need to (for ammo/bandages in a tight situation.) 
But I cannot understand why it is first instinct for most people to finish off everybody they knock down. 



I have gotten an easy kill many times because a guy is staring at the ground trying to finish a guy. It makes you an easy target when you should be looking around for the guy’s teammates. Also, if you knock my teammate and finish him off, it GUARANTEES that if I knock you down I will blast you in the face as well instead of looking for your teammate. You take out my friend, I’m getting revenge. 



There is a reason that you get knocked down instead of being eliminated right away. So that the team that wins the fight gets a chance to have all their guys back, which I think they deserve to do if they win the fight. 



What are your thoughts? Do you finish people right away, if so, what’s your reasoning for it? Not looking to shame anyone, just curious how other people feel about it. In my opinion there should be an unspoken rule that you leave the downed guys alone and finish them off by wiping the team. Anyone else think so?

OBVIOUSLY it’s not real! You are the stupid one if you take it seriously. Every time I pick up a scar I always say I picked up an automatic sniper cuz the scar destroys people form range.

**My proposal**

* Lengthen the amount of time before the first circle initially spawns. Or…  
* Reduce the speed of the second circle

I understand that randomness is a core part of fortnite with things like the circle placement, looting, and weapon bloom. The reason I love this game is because nearly every time I die I realize I could have made a better play. Every once in a while, this isn’t the case though. 

If you wait until the end of the bus route to jump and the second circle spawn on the complete opposite corner of the map you should just quit and start over. If you stop to loot you don’t have time to make it. If you stop to fight you won’t be able to make it, even if you finish the fight relatively quickly.

Once the update comes out this issue will be more noticeable. Imagine landing at Junk Junction and the second circle is centered over the prison. There’s absolutely no way you’re going to make it

I have always been apprehensive about these games because I thought there must be people who are so good at this game there is no way I can compete.

I have gotta say the last couple weeks have completely confirmed that, I die so much to people who are just complete gods at building its not even fun. I look these people up on a stat tracker and they have close to a thousand hours in the game.

How am I supposed to compete with someone like that? I mean its one thing to die to someone who out shoots you, but 1000 hours? There is 100% no way I could beat someone with that much building experience.

I try and try to improve my building, I have a hundred hours but I feel like I am getting no where. By the time I can get a simple 2x2 built this dude has a 3 story 2x2 going with stairs shooting out towards my base.

My win rate is atrocious, only 50 games out of 700, probably one of the worst out of people who actually care to improve.

I never camp and hide, I always try to play aggressive and land in populated areas because I hear thats the best way to improve, but man does it feel impossible playing against people who have that much play time, just not fun. And I feel like I honestly can't learn anything from the experience either.

I would be having a lot more fun playing with people around my skill level. I understand there are 100 people in a game so a matchmaker would be tough to implement, but there are soooo many people playing this game at this point, I feel like it should not be that far out of reach.",FortNiteBR

I play with people met through the Fortnite official discord and sometimes with my IRL friends on Console. 

On the 15/1/18 I was playing with 2 randoms and a friend from discord when was kicked by the banhammer when landing in Pleasant Park... naturally everyone didn't really know what was going on and I assumed that I lagged out at first. 

They left the game for me and we went back into another and I get kicked again... this time it tells me I'm using a VPN or Proxy server (I'm not) and I just leave and assume it will sort itself out tomorrow.

Next day once I'm back from school I can't login as it tells me ""account disabled"" for either Fraud, Misconduct In-Game, or from my input. 

I have since emailed Epic Games and received a reply telling me that I was observed to be cheating to gain an unfair advantage over other players. I told them that I wasn't hacking I do occasional live streams (https://twitch.tv/jakestewartz) even though nobody really watches, the Fortnite ones may be a bit old but there is my proof.

I tell the support team all of the above and they just reply with the same and say that I was permanently banned.

I haven't hacked and I have moneys worth on this account... I emailed again but the auto-reply said that the inquiry was closed.

I went and made a second account that wasn't disabled and join back onto discord to get kicked by the banhammer again for VPN/proxy fiddling (I have never even downloaded Ip/proxy changers; Its my dad's pc!).

So now I turn to reddit... If moderators read this then please help me or let me know how to fix this/ whats wrong here.

I know you guys love instant easy kills, but can’t we all agree it’s a little bit silly at this point? I’ve been tracking my games, and over the past 30 drops, 18 of my deaths were during shotgun bunny-hopping fights. That’s over half of my deaths. I also won a lot of fights, I tried to count how many of those shotgun fights I got in altogether but I lost track pretty quickly. I can say for sure I was either attacked or did the attacking with a shotgun at least once every drop. Most drops it happens multiple times.

I just think it takes away from the game, idk about you guys but I get really excited every time I’m in a medium range fight because I think “YES, anything but a bunny-hop fight!”. Like at this rate it should be renamed “PumpshotgunNite” because that’s basically all that matters.

I know a lot of you guys like it because it’s easy for you to get tons of instant kills on bad players, but is that really the fortnite you want? Maybe everyone loves it this way and if so I’ll take my downvotes but personally I’d like to see the shotguns more balanced out with mid/long range weapons.

INFECTED :

100 hp. Infected can not use sheilds, however their health slowly regenerates, so finish them off fast. 

The infected are faster, louder, and with higher and farther jumping abilities. They use nothing but a flame sword to slay enemies with. The infected can not build, however they can climb walls (most likely using same button as to jump). Ideally, the infected would all wear the same husk type skin, to make it clear from a distance who is infected. 

Obviously, when an infected slays a soldier, the soldier revives as an infected. If a soldier dies due to not sticking a landing, he is out of the game. This is to prevent soldiers from killing themselves to become an infected.

SOLDIERS:

Normal circle and item spawns. Everything remains the same, but your enemy has just become far more sinister. Everyone drops from the same bus, so better hope you dont land right next to an infected!

IN CONCLUSION:

Would take a little extra work from epic, in terms of the hust skin, faster movement, and the new climbing action for the infected. I do feel the climbing is essential, otherwise it would be too easy for soldiers to make massive bases and keep out the infected. My other idea was to give the flame sword heavy damage to structures, but then that would make it too easy for the infected, as a group of infected could take out a fort in a short time and leave the soldiers with no cover whatsoever. I feel the climbing action would be more fun and fit the infected character better. 

Also, i tried to make it balanced, but also so that people would look forward to being an infected. We wouldnt want people leaving the game as soon as they realize they are infected. 

Open to feedback/critisism! I think it would be a blast! ",FortNiteBR

When you get into a team fight. You can get pushed by people while constantly getting explosives thrown at you.

This is very unfair and very hard to beat, as they can push with shotguns while your cover gets torn apart by explosives.

However, Fortnite Battle Royale just surpassed 40 million users with 2 million concurrent which suggests to me that maybe Epic isn't so quick to change a fundamental aspect of the game.  The current shooting model doesn't seem to be deterring growth or play time.

For all the fans of the current shooting model, do you think we have a chance?

So please don't come at me saying this is stupid/impossible or something, just looking for discussion/feedback.

I know this is going to be a HUGE stretch, and maybe I played too much *Ark Survival* in my past, but I would love to see a game type where you collected the material and could craft up you're own weapons. Obviously it would have to be completely separate from the main game type, and item spawns would have to be strictly healing items/materials. 

**Quick Example to put it in perspective for an early game scenario:**
So say the game starts and you land in Tomato Town with another player. The first tier of weapon could be a sword/dagger (Like the easiest/simplest to craft). Obviously wood is easy to come by and creating a wooden sword would be easy compared to a metal sword. You can collect a little wood and make yourself a wooden sword and rush at your opponent. During this time, the other player decided to go straight for a metal sword, and was harvesting the cars around Tomato Town. Since he wasted his time and did not get the metal he needed in time, you could easily take him out. Or vice versa, he could get it in time before you find him, and the time spent would be worth it when he has a metal sword to fight with.

**When it comes to mid-late game:**
Obviously this is all just an idea and not that serious, but I feel like it could be taken a lot of ways after that. Like once the game progresses and you collect more and more you could craft weapons like Bows, Arrows, Slingshots, Cannons, Spears, Battering Rams, and more. I don't know how guns/explosives would work, but they would have to be very difficult to craft as it would be pretty overpowered bringing a gun to a sword fight. 
I also think it would make base building a more important part of the game if you can't just be knocked out with a couple RPGs or a Grenade Launcher.

But like I said this is all just a drunk idea I had and definitely not possible right now, but I would love to hear some feedback and what you would want to be able to craft and fight with",FortNiteBR

Currently how deadly it is relies more on the players skill. As the faster you can swap the shotguns after shooting once makes it all the much more better. But just because something takes skill doesn't mean it should be fair. In all honestly I uttermost dislike this strat and it kinda leaves a disconnect to me playing this game as I feel it abuses a glitch, or it bypasses it witht he fact that by shooting, switching, shooting, and then switching back doesn't require you to pump back up the original one as the game thinks it was already pumped.

Now, before I explain my fix to this, let me explain, I am not completely biased towards this subject and infact, I too use this strat showing how uttermost ridiculous it is ingame. I've see streamers have some opinion on double pump to viewers and I've seen quite a bit of 2 pump threads running on this subreddit. 

My fix is for this strat is, the player can still shoot, switch and then shoot once more, but if they switch again, they have to repump the original shotgun like the weapon is intended. Therefore, allowing the strat to still be there, but just not where I'd practically consider it abusing a game mechanic. 

Now before any of you little jokesters say ""git gud"" or something or defend this. Legit think about the fact that bypassing the main concept of the weapon, (the one huge downside of the weapon). Has it right in the name, you're bypassing a main function, and I'd like to come right up there and say that's completely unfair to me as a player and leaves a disconnect when somebody does that and then does a dance emote ontop of my body, I sometimes groove to the music other then this case, but when I die to this strat I'm only just sitting there for 15 seconds complaining to myself that I can't use the semi-auto shotgun to counter a slow moving weapon, the semi-auto shotgun is supposed to be semi-auto not the double pump strat. 

Post script: I get that double pump takes up 2 item slots in the inventory. But that's not the point of what I'm getting at, the double pump strat is legit bypassing a weapon's function and I'd like to see an end to it. 


tl;dr: double pump strat bypasses core weapon function and should be fixed accordingly.

Why ? WHats the fuckin reason ? Its absolutely pointless and stupid.  

You guys started to abuse Epic's communication with community. You just keep posting your ideas and if they dont get implemented, you get mad. And believe me, its kinda overwhelming for Epic to fix the game and add your ideas simultaniously.
Every goddamn day I see at least 4 post with a title ""suggestion"". Yes, I love the new ideas but not the pointless ones. 




Yes, there are many awesome ideas like the umbrella tier (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7r0lvy/suggestion_umbrella_tiers/), or the one showing a friend's loot (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7qvceq/suggestion_to_show_teammates_loot_now_that/). 

But you guys need to distinguish good ideas and dumb ideas.

p.s. this is just my opinion and you may disagree. And btw sry for my potato english.

Sure people will hate on me and honestly I don’t care if friendly fire is on or not but people have made it out to be so much worse than it is. I am aware that friendly fire being disabled makes Fortnite more of a “joke” Battle Royal game but remember you can dab in this game so it’s pretty much a joke from the get go and that’s not a bad thing. I think the better system would be friendly fire down to 1 HP so that players can’t team kill but hitting a team mate is nearly as punishing as it would have been originally so it’s kinda a win win between hardcore players and people who hate being team killed.

The current loot model is not even in the realm of appealing to me. Numerous reasons, and honestly it's a separate discussion for another time.

This is how to get my money. (because I want to give you some of it)

- One time purchase price which grants access to Lootboxes you earn through play (that have a chance to get any vanity items - nothing locked out), with the option to purchase more. See: Overwatch &amp; Halo 5. Overwatch is really the prime example, because you can also use coins you get in lootboxes to purchase individual items that you like instead of waiting to see if you will get it in a lootbox.

Whales still throw money at you, and you get money from people like me.

Let's discuss.,"With the recent ""proof"" on reddit for shotgun damage to be broken there were also some very convincing counter arguments.

This is Grimmz clip that is supposed to be proof of the damage being broken.

https://clips.twitch.tv/FitAmazonianSharkWutFace

This is the thread.

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7qq9qx/to_everyone_saying_shotgun_damage_isnt_broken_and

As we can see grimmz does 9 damage on his enemy and this has made ppl to believe that the damage is broken.

────────

Now for some counter arguments

**Fact: a shotgun shot exists of 10 pellets with equal damage. Confirmed by epic in this thread**. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7m7zu0/how_exactly_do_shotguns_work_in_this_game/drsbdx3

We can apply this to grimmz shot with the footage and explanation here:

If you watch the glowing sparks occluded by his player model, you can see that most of it did indeed hit the wall:

https://gfycat.com/EqualRepulsiveFowl

Also wall HP/damage appears to be 90 as the 9 player damage is floating around:

https://i.imgur.com/EavPF9l.png . 

Pair that with the fact that the white pump does 9 player damage, 10 env damage per pellet. There are 10 pellets a shot and you get a wall that takes 90 damage and a player that takes 9.

────────

**Could we get an official statement on the behavior of shotgun pellets please? Assuming there are pellets**.

I feel like most ppl just ride this train and say they have had this experience too. While most of the clips show them just missing the target and have one or more pellets hit.

This would also explain how you can get a double kill with a shotgun. 

http://gfycat.com/UnhealthyAccurateKingfisher

Would be nice to have this mechanic explained. (if it is there) for future reference and to avoid topics popping up every few minutes. 

Thanks in advance.

So if you try to shotgun your teammate in the face you just down yourself.

Sure it could still be trolled by players jumping in front of you when your shooting but that would be a lot harder to accomplish than the old way. And since enemies would be around it’s more likely the players would be too busy to try and get you killed.   This would be the best way as it creates a situation where you still have to be aware of where your teammates are when using explosives and can’t just spray grenades while your teammate rush in. 

Ideally the best way to implement this would be to have only explosives reflect damage and regular bullets just be nullified but it might be confusing to some players having two different systems at once.",FortNiteBR

Examples:

EU: [10,000 + 3,500 V-Bucks for €99,99](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/store/p/fortnite-10000-3500-bonus-v-bucks/bwd299hxcxqk)

Now you might think the pricing seems fair, but let's compare. 
___

If you live in the US you can purchase the 10,000 V-Buck pack for $100,00 but if you live in Europe you have to pay €100,00. 

Convert this €100,00 to Dollars and you end up with roughly $122,00. 

We are overpaying rougly $22,00, which converts to about €18,00.

___

If you live in the UK you can purchase the 10,000 V-Buck pack for £80,00 but if you live in Europe you have to pay €100,00. 

Convert this €100,00 to GBP and you end up with roughly £89,00.

We are overpaying rougly £9,00 GBP, which converts to about €10,40.

___

I highly doubt something will be done about this but I still wanted to make a topic about it.


PS: 80 GBP = rougly $110,00 dollars so UK is overpaying aswell, but not nearly as much as EU is.

Both games have a ranked system, though the two are very different from eachother.

H1Z1, for example, gives you a rank based on your 10 best games in the season. Combining kills with the place you finished each game, to give you a total score. That total score accumulates with all 10 games and gives you a final placement until you 'out do' one of your other top ten games. 

League, on the other hand is a tug of war system (which might work in duos/squads, but not as well for solos), where your rank depends on if youve been winning or losing your games after your 10 placement matches. 

Since the leaderboards have come out, theyve either been broken, or uninteresting. Potentially adding a ranked system similar to H1 would give players something to work towards. It would encourage players who like to camp it out, to get involved in the game. It would encourage them to get better at gun mechanics, as well as building. 

What are your thoughts?

TL;DR - consider adding in a ranked system that allows players to track their skill level, and get them involved more in the game.",FortNiteBR

I've never had more fun with any other game. You are on to a winner here.

The building is fluent and can be done in the middle of a battle seamlessly. The guns feel very well balanced and the environment and art style is excellent, soon to be double excellent! All thanks to your continued development of this already great game.

But... I have this gripe... this annoyance... this deep hatred... this lingering burning rage in my stomach...

I'll set the scene for you here...

So I've dropped Greasy Grove, dived just the right distance away to land perfectly on top of the Diner. Grey pump action in hand, nobody dares approach me, I watch as they swiftly steer away to the outlying buildings out of fear of insta-death upon landing. I laugh maniacally and switch to my slurp keg on a stick and beat the crap out of the floor below me to get to my first chest...

HELL YEAH! A grey SMG and some bandages. Score! (Lets not talk about grey SMG's in chests.)

I break the wall next to me, loot the 3 ammo boxes in close proximity and find a blue AR. I subsequently part ways with my excellent grey SMG. I follow my usual Greasy Diner route and make my way to the bottom floor to collect another chest, a blue bolt action shines in front of me begging to be picked up and utilised. I quickly take this as I hear footsteps above.

Grey pump out. Footsteps are getting louder. I stand close the the corner and wait for my victim..... BLAM... headshot! 100+ damage. Enjoy the trip back to the lobby.

1 KILL.

I move back up stairs and a silent enemy greets me with a blue tactical shotty. I jump, shoot, 80+ and jump, shoot, 80+... he's out. Gone. Probably swearing at me in whichever European language he speaks. He totally had the drop on me but choked...

2 KILLS.

I pick up a green pump and spike trap, drop the grey pump and take out another 3 players on my way out of Greasy Grove. All 1 or 2 hit kills. I see some shields nearby and guzzle the blue juice like it's my job. I'm now 200hp. I have decent weapons and feel invincible.

5 KILLS.

As my character runs toward the circle with enough stamina to rival Mo Farah, I spot a couple of guys fighting quite a distance away. I decide to pull out the shiny blue bolt and try my luck. I take out one guy as the other retreats evidently in a panic as he leaves a trail of structures behind.

6 KILLS.

I make a bee line towards him and whip out the ol' green pump as I search behind trees, bushes and player made walls. I find him bushing it and make quick work of him.

7 KILLS.

I have a glance at players remaining, top 50 baby. That's another daily challenge complete. I then see another bush whacker in the distance. I snipe him and the guy sneaking about the trees behind him.

9 KILLS.

By this point, I'm getting nervous because I have a good few kills and I'm hoping to beat my record of 16 kills for the victory, so I play a little less aggressive. Just as I think this, someone pops a few shots at me from behind. I insta build a 1x1 square and ramp, switch to my AR and return fire, I empty a clip of valuable medium bullets into this guy.

10 KILLS.

Fast forward to the next circle, it's pretty small now, we're in Salty and there's plenty of cover in those houses. I scout ahead and make a decision to go for the smaller house. I run inside, shotgun in hand and wipe out the poor sod holding his blueprints.

11 KILLS.

I place my acquired spike traps on the ceiling and floor of the doorway for double damage. I'm still 200hp, amazingly. As I'm reloading I hear building outside and then footsteps on the roof. He absolutely knows I'm in here but I'm in the circle and have plenty of time to waste, so I use my slow clap to induce some sort of reaction. He then loses his patience and breaks through the ceiling, I head for the doorway and exit before he has a chance to shoot. He (stupidly) follows, without care and falls into my trap. I feel dirty at the disrespect I've shown him.

12 KILLS.

Well on my way to a record game, I head for the next circle and take out 3 more players along the way in no particularly interesting fashion. I glance at the remaining players, 11 left. Enough for me to secure a win over 16 kills if I push towards any fire fights and finish off the weakest links.

15 KILLS.

I head for the highest point in the circle and build a 1x1x3 tower and heal up to 125hp. As I take my last mini shield I see 2 players having a build off on top of a house. I spray them both down with my newly acquired laser beam... I mean gold AR.

17 KILLS.

Ok, so the record can be made, I just need to win, 5 left, 4 left, 3 left. Top 3, this is where the boys become men and girls become women. This is grown up shit. I am now sweating blood as the circle god has not favoured me and is making me move toward the other large tower to the west. I make a quick exit through a door I have created facing away from the west tower. I do this to break line of sight with them. I slowly back up and hear shooting from my right. Player 3 has not seen me and is busy focusing on Mr west tower. I green pump this dude so bad he must have felt the shot through his TV.

18 KILLS.

This is it, 1v1. Circle moving in, I am forced to run in Mr west towers direction... west... He of course has seen me and is shooting down on me with incredible accuracy. I'm now at 11hp... SHIT. I build uppity a double ramp and wall then another ramp and wall, we are now on equal footing. Level ground, I switch to my trusty green pump action, pre-aim and pop my head up...

BLAM... headshot! 12 damage? Yellow crit numbers... Retreat!!

2nd shot ready, I pop up again...

BLAM... headshot, 16 damage!?!? Yellow crit numbers...

I try to retreat again but it's too late...

The fiery burning sensation in my stomach has now erupted and I'm spewing profanity at my television screen. I feel angry, upset and betrayed... how coukd the game do this to me!? I played so well... I... I... I'm speechless.

18 KILLS. 2nd PLACE.

End.

In case you're wondering, yes, I'm still salty about this. I guess, to sum it all up and put it bluntly. My complaint is... please fix the god damn inconsistencies with shotguns. Why does it do that? Can it even be fixed? It's the most annoying thing to end a stellar game with this slap in the face.

Please, I beg you, fix this :'(

Love,
ZooSe

Well, some background first. I'm a master Overwatch player. I have ""decent"" aim by all means in Overwatch but I consider that I have more skill in gamesense and knowledge rather than pure mechanical aim.
I played around 15 to 20 hours of Fortnite for now.

So, all in all, I can pretty much say that I'm above the average player in the FPS realm.

What makes Fortnite such a bad shooter in my opinion?

First, the weapons accuracy are awful. You might stand still, crouched, with the legendary scar that the spray of this weapon at 30m just makes you miss at least 50 to 60 % of your shots. I don't mind a game design choice that focus on more CQC rather than mid to long range gunfights, but here comes my second point.

CQC is very, very inconsistent. Shotguns damage are... enigmatic, at the very least. For instance, I can say very well why I didn't do that much damage in Overwatch with Reaper or D.Va (shotgun heroes), the spray is clear, the reticle is clear, the hit registration is clear.
For the love of me, I can't say why i did 30 damage with that shotgun at 2 m with a perfect torso hit. 

Chests are a bad game design choice. I don't mind having areas with higher quality loot. Nor randomized loot location. The fact that chests aren't randomized per se (they come in very specific and predictable locations) forces pretty much all players to go for these chests. I find myself going for a 3-chest locations and dying at landing because a player got there 3 s before myself.
And going for those chests first is the best strategy, better gear, faster, but being killed or killing somebody naked in the first 10 s of landing isn't fun in any sense of the word. Perhaps it's fun for the first couple times, but it gets boring really quick.

And finally, my final point, the game is far too complicated. It feels cluttered with controls, and those controls aren't even good.
5 slots that you have to manage for maybe 2-3-4 weapons, shields, health packs, and whatnot.
4 shortcuts to get to specific constructions that you can rotate, switch material, edit...
I don't even bring in the fact that you have to collect materials at some point and the 17 Hz tickrate.

Shooters should be straight forward. Counter-strike does this wonderfully, you aim, you shoot, that's it. Overwatch on the other hand is on the complicated side of shooters, you need to manage your ultimate, weapons are vastly different, projectiles, hitscans, semi lock lasers, you get abilities with cooldowns but in the end, it's still a pretty easy to understand game, you can get into one game, and get really quickly into the game and win some matches, even without optimal usage of your abilities (or even some of them), some heroes don't even need their abilities that much or are pretty easy to use like Soldier: 76 where sprint is his ability or Widowmaker that barely uses her abilities that may appeal to pure FPS players.

Fortnite doesn't allow you to do that. You can't just hop into a game, and just enjoy the side of the game you want like shooting people. You need to scavange for weapons, ammos, shields, crafting materials.
Imagining the gunplay being fun, you just couldn't land on the first cabin you find, get an M16 with 30 ammo and going gun blazing and hoping to win. That wouldn't work pretty much all the time. First, because as I said, the gunplay is inconsistent at best, clunky at worst, then because you'd be at a huge disadvantage over someone that just somehow uses the broad toolkit of the game.

Now, hear me out. Everything I said stands from a shooter perspective, Fortnite BR might be a good game overall (one that I don't particularly enjoy), it is just a piss poor shooter. They might aswell remove the gunplay, add some gear scores with dice rolls and Fortnite wouldn't feel that different.

There are improvements possible though, first and foremost, weapon accuracy really needs a huge improvement. First shot spray cone shouldn't be that large, it feels really bad to miss 4 shots in a row while standing still because the game decided that you won't hit those even with perfect aim.
Second, the tickrate needs a good buff, 18 Hz on average is just too low, the gold standard right now is 60 Hz and that's it. 
Battlefield 1 with its 64 players, no hitscan weapon, does it, so 40 Hz on Fortnite isn't a huge stretch considering bandwith and server load.

I'd like to volunteer my time to answer some questions that you may or may not have regarding the Save the World feature within Fortnite.

Long story short, there is a very thick line between the two communities STW and BR. All STW players can also play BR if they choose, but BR players cannot play STW currently due to it being locked behind a paid Early Access.

I have spoken with several BR only players and have asked them ""Why have you not tried STW?""

One of the most common responses was ""I'm not a fan of Tower Defense"" games. 

This is a huge misconception regarding STW. This game mode is extremely in-depth with character development, farming for perfect builds, farming for materials/resources, Main Heroes, Support Heroes, Tactical Heroes, Survivor Squads...and all the different game modes one can play...different hero classes and more!

So ask away, there is no such thing as a bad question.

I wont try to sell the game to you, but I'll do my best to help you decide if it this portion of the game is worth your time and money! :D

I'm very supportive of STW and have taken the time to really understand the focus within this game mode.

https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/comments/7qtmxs/an_open_discussion_on_where_were_at/

https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/ - our sub is on fire now

https://www.reddit.com/r/paragon/comments/7qvwxx/something_is_wrong_so_if_imsko_never_leaked_that/

Epic has severely affected the development of these 3 games to make fortnite what it is today. I will speak for the paragon side and I will encourage anyone in those communities to speak up and correct or back up my claims

Unreal tournament has stopped receiving updates for about 6 months. 

Paragon development is being stopped or may have already stopped a long time ago internally , now we are told directly its being slowed down evident by the post by epic on the paragon sub and the history of paragons development.

An influential pro player named imsko informed us he was told by a dev or devs that paragons development will be stopped by the end of february.

Imsko told us a day previously before epic made a reddit post telling us honestly about paragons development. Imsko words were the only reason epic even attempted to speak to players and without him , epic would have kept us in the dark. 

- Paragons matchmaking development was removed because it was re implemented for fortnite BR 

- Paragons devs were slowly removed from the game and more resources were allocated to fortnite BR  

- We even heard that the comp QA team for paragon was moved to fortnite.  

- We started receiving more delayed patches and less communication. There were game breaking bugs that were left in paragon for weeks such as a hero in the game doing over 4000 damage in one ability and epics devs actually defended it and said it was not a big deal. 

- Paragons 2017 road map was left in shambles and was barely half finished.

We as paragon players are losing a game we love , same as the fortnite pve players and unreal tournament players. I hope you fortnite players really enjoy your game and have fun with it , because it has killed something people loved. I hope you appreciate it and I also hope you give this thread exposure to make epic address it , you are the golden child.   

Epic does not want to talk to us paragon players and they are not attempting to let us know if the game will be shut down. 

Please help all of us make epic speak and be transparent for once. Thank you           

**TLDR : Epic has severely affected the development of these 3 games by removing devs, slowing down updates and a lack of transparency (unreal tournament, paragon and fortnite PVE)  to make fortnite BR what it is today. To chase the gold goose because BR is a popular genre.**  

**Edit : I am very aware as to why it is beneficial for epic to focus on fortnite. That is not the point, I am asking for exposure to make epic talk to its communities and let us know what is happening to the games we love. We are literally not sure if these games will be shutdown and epic is not making it clear.**

It governs many shit-heads from being said shit-heads. 



Example: Just had a game where we were killing everybody, 2, maybe 3 teams left and we get bad circle rng. (Backstory, team before us dropped a launch pad and our random picked it up, spent a good 5 minutes trying to get him to talk, asked for it, etc.) We start running saying ""hey -insert totally nice individuals name here- can you build up and place the launch pad, we really dont want to come up on the team from outside the circle"" ""build up"" ""ill build and you just place launch pad then"" He doesn't even take the ramp, he just runs off on his own and like clockwork, soon as we come out of the circle we get laid out by them all. Soon as the random dies the launch pad gets launched out of his corpse. He then talks on mic 'haha get cucked idiots' and leaves.





This is a situation where nearing the end it was obvious he was just trying to troll us because he knew there was nothing we could do.",FortNiteBR

Like, it's always been a bit wonky, but for the last few weeks it just seems flat out broken. I Used to have multiple loot runs which were pretty reliable where you'd move from place to place with gun spawns and chest spawns and you'd generally get normal or reasonable loot most of the time. Occasionally you'd get a cracking gun and be so chuffed. Other times you get a gray SMG in a chest and be pissed.


But recently, it's become so consistent that if I land and there's no chest on first location then I know there will be no chest in the first 4 or 5 spots that used to ALWAYS  have a chest. And sometimes houses will not even have single thing in it. A brick maybe. And on top of that it's like the same loot spawns over and over right next to each other. You check first usual loot location, there's a revolver. Balls. Next 5 or 6 loot location and there's like 4 other grey revolvers. Or pistols or whatever. What the hell is that?!


 Or you might get lucky and get a purple scar! Wow so rare right? Nope, 3 out of the 4 squad members also got a scar in the next two houses along as well. Wtf? Or scoped ar's. If I get one I guarantee, I will see 3 or 4 in the next 5 mins.


I see it happen regularly now. If someone gets a shield, then the full team will be shielded to 100 and have 2 or 3 spare. I regularly get to the end game and one team got 3 or 4 sniper rifles, and the other team got nothing but rocket launchers and your just trading with them at the end game, your whole team sniping and Thier  while team rocketing.


The straw that broke the camels back was i had a game of duos earlier, me and my mate got three medkits in our first landing spots and a couple of pistols. Met a team after like 45 seconds at the next house along the road, killed them, and picked up another FOUR medkits. They didn't even have a gun. No guns but seven medkits out of 10 loot spawn points. What in the actual?!

It sucks.

I was wondering if epic are tweaking and changing it about to see how battles play out, how it affects game length, the amount of players that die early etc etc.


Sorry about the long rant, I'm not good at being succinct.

Epic, please at least put parameters for the loot, that if something spawns in X location the next nearest few locations won't have it.",FortNiteBR

“BUT ITS OP!!1!”

No. In season 2, yeah, it was. But at the end of season 4 it really wasn’t, and that was before the spam meta took off. 


“BUT ITS AN EXPLOIT1!1!1” 

And so is rocket riding, yet you don’t see me complaining. 


“BUT THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE!1!!”

You lose an inventory slot to shoot slightly faster. That sounds like a downside to me. 


“BUT THERE IS NO COUNTER!1!!” 

Just build, lol. 


“BUT EVERYONE WOULD USE IT!1!1!”

Actually, double shotgun would arguably add more variety, because rn everybody either uses single shotgun or shotgun-smg. Back at the end of season 4, people used both those *and* double pump. 


“BUT IT TAKES NO SKILL!1!1!”

But shotgun-SMG spam does? I could pump-smg with my keyboard upside down if I wanted to. With double pump you have to actually master the timing. Its a nice extra learning curve. 

“BUT THE COMMUNITY WOULD REACT NEGATIVELY!!1!!”

I'm gonna say right off the bat, i don't give two fucks about gender, i don't care for feminism or mra shit cause it's irrelevant, however each group sometimes faces low key hatred i guess, the only reason I'm bringing up women at all is because it's relavent to the question 

Essentially I just play with random people and I mute the microphone as well the speech volume because some game's communities are toxic as fuck, but at the same time, I'm probably sabotaging my team by not communicating with them. I'm a semi decent player, i don't suck but I'm not insanely good like a large chunk of the community, am getting there though

I just need practice and coordination but I'm really nervous, because in some other games, I'd try to use the microphone and i don't even put emphasis on gender, or announce it because that's annoying and irrelevant. Hate it when girls do that

 Yet, I'd STILL be bombarded with edgy, and unoriginal insults. i don't get offended by sexist jokes, they're funny, but when someone is berating me the entire game because they think it makes them look cool, it's fucking distracting and mildly irritating. 

I try to pretend I'm a 12 year old boy, if I can, because my voice is deep and pretty rough but it's still a woman's voice, sometimes it works. 

Basically my question to other female players is, do you have bad experiences on the microphone more than not? 

My question to the male players is, how often do you encounter women in the game and how do you feel about it?

To anyone, do you think it's okay in this community to mic up if you're a female?

No im not implying men are sexist or women are victims, or some convoluted shit, i just wanna know if this community has a higher amount of toxicity because it's so big right now

I know that in general the gaming community can be garbage and every group has their bad apples, and no matter how ""good"" the fortnite community is, there is no doubt i would encounter a douche one day, I'd just leave. 

Obviously, the game is very popular and has a lot of... Erm tryhards. I hate using that word and i don't want to generalize the community but damn I've never used that word till i started playing this. 

Anyways, in some communities it might be impossible to play as a woman (*cough cough* gta online *cough cough *) 

Do you find that to be true with this game or is it more accepting? Just wanna be sure I don't offend anyone before getting on the mic ",FortNiteBR

1: rocket launchers are extremely annoying in this mode as they don't contribute to fights and makes suicide bombing very common. Also since RPGS are only available In supply drops people that have them are normally people that don't contribute to the fight and instead go for supply drops. Rocket launchers should not be available in this mode.

2: grapplers are very common in team rumble and are extremely annoying to fight against. Especially with the material drought. Grapplers should not be in this mode.

3: materials are easy to farm but hard to collect in this mode. Firstly there aren't enough materials leading to material droughts and secondly they are hard to pick up. Materials should drop in higher amounts on kill and go straight to your inventory.

How would you guys feel about decoy grenades?

I was thinking is that there would be 3 different (pretty self explanatory) decoy grenades:

1) Gunfire - Simulates gunfire in the area thrown, maybe draw people looking to 3rd party over to the area for you to pick them off, or steer an enemy's attention in another direction while you make your move to attack. 

2) Footsteps - Throw this near an enemy to make them hear footsteps and chase ghosts while you take up a better position, for example. 

And

3) Builds - Throw this at an enemy which then simulates sounds of someone building up on them, causing them to unnecessarily build fight and waste valuable materials.

Again, no idea how good/bad this would be in actual gameplay but the idea came to me so I thought I'd post and see what other people thought about it 😊

Pump shotguns just don’t shoot after edits (mainly) when ping above 20. Remove the delay, do whatever you want. But I can’t play like this. I have spent hundreds of euros on this game. I deserve better and I deserve to complain.

Fix your shotgun delay. It doesn’t make any sense at all. Just add another way of making the delay. But I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT MY GUNS TO KILL PEOPLE. 

Thank you. ",FortNiteBR

1. Die early game even if I have a shotgun or SMG because of how disoriented I am
2. Place top 10 with a decent amount of kills, but get killed, one again because of my poor close range combat skills
3. Not be a bot for once and build decently, pull off a lucky shotgun shot once in a while for the win

I really love Fortnite and I'm constantly impressed by how much dedication you put into it. I started playing in season 4 and with some practice, I was able to get about 70 victory royales in season 5 and 6. But it's not like that anymore. You can fix the game and balance it out as best you can but one thing you can't balance is the fact that I don't have the time or patience to compete with those that do. I'm just a casual player who would like to have fun in this amazing game you've developed. But constantly getting eliminated by someone who can do four or five edits in the time it takes me to do one isn't fun. I know I could put off battle royale and spend time in playground or the third mode getting better but frankly I don't enjoy that. I end up getting bored and finding something else to play while wishing I could just play Fortnite and have fun doing it.

A ranking system would fix this. The only other shooter game that I've played longer than a week or two is Splatoon and that had a ranking system. I always hung around rank C or B and made it to A- once before getting annihilated back to where I belong. I didn't care though because the game was still fun (until the wii u was dead and nintendo no longer updated it.) Your game is in desperate need of a ranking system. This is why people are switching over to Apex. Please stop listening to the competitive players who claim it's because your game is ""broken"". The lack of a ranking system doesn't bother them because it makes their victories easier.

 Fortnite is by far one of the best if not THE best game I ever played. I've put well over 900 hours into it which is a new record for me. It was completely my choice to spend $200+ on cosmetics and I regret nothing. I don't want to act like these entitled kids who demand this and that like you owe us. But sadly if there is no ranking system soon then I guess it's my time to go. Which sucks alot because I really want to see all of the cool stuff that you guys add without getting infuriated by sweaty competitive players.

 Thats it. I hope you Fortnite devs read this and consider it. Thanks for making such a great game. ",FortNiteBR

Mine is a cyberpunk, military and more robotic themed. With cyberpunk scavengers to a Terminator style skin, some cool mechanical gliders like a really cyberpunk-y vibe blimp.      
My idea for a tier 1 skin would be a robot that started as one of those 80s wind up robot toys, and would evolve to an advanced armour. As the s7 bp introduced two evolving skins, a second tier 1 skin would be a biker girl with some neon lights (the same colour scheme as most synthwave stuff, purple blue and pink) that would get more and more neon each stage that would come. 
       
The tier 100 skin that would have ""custom parts"". The skin would be a robot, and you can unlock arms, legs, torsos, heads and colours with XP, then you can customize the skin on your locker. That would create a whole new level of customization.      
      
A new cosmetic is introduce would be legendary wraps. A wrap that can only be selected for one type of weapon (replaces the model of epic/legendary versions) e.g. the pump would have the crusader model from Save The World or the tac with the hydraulic shotgun from the same mode.      
Also a tiny robot pet.

I've also played MechWarrior Online (MWO). I don't want to see this game go to trash like MWO has.

If you have played MWO, you know it takes forever to load a game. You will also know it takes less time to load a 4v4 game than a 12v12 game. Why is this? MWO allows customization to the extreme; paints, sprays, weapons, attachments. It has to load all these things; who has what and where on them.

Back in season 4, Fortnite BR ran pretty well. But now, performance is getting worse and worse by the week. Loading used to take me a couple of seconds but now it's 15 seconds minimum. Why? Customizable things keep being added. Insignificant things like the color of your gun that litterally no one can see unless you're 5 feet away. These small things hinder the game. I'm fine for new stuff like skins but the small ""only I can see"" will slowly bring the game to its knees.

I'm even more convinced this is the case since all that was revealed when the iceberg broke was a hatch just like the one in Wailing Woods. Now I just wonder how significant the damage will be to the map and if this monster will just destroy the whole map if its not stopped before season 8s start..

This is because if you are a sweat/tryhard/player who likes building a lot, you can play normal solos and/or the events where you have 3k mats and can build fight like crazy. However, if you’re like me, and want to play for fun and hate dying to sweaty players that build a lot or whatever, you can just play ground game where you’re limited to 300 mats total so it’s enough to build a bit, because that’s essential but you wouldn’t get into a huge build fights initiated by a sweaty players. Therefore, this makes the game enjoyable for all players. 

I hope you think this is a reasonable idea, Fortnite can always do a tester for 2 weeks or something and ask for everyone’s feedback, like they did with glider redeploy

So when you go around being a dick, you're going to run into some problems. 

Calling people ""bots"" or ""trash"" doesn't make Fortnite look good from an outsiders perspective. 1 bad apple spoils the bunch and we all begin to develop a reputation as emotionally immature, disrespectful, losers. As a community we need to do better and be more kind. 

And we need to realize that anyone can get clapped in Fortnite, at anytime, by anyone. Skill levels are largely irrelevant in Fortnite due to the luck and situational aspects involved. Tfue and Ninja and every other sweaty streamer are not gods, they are normal people with flaws and imperfections. 

So give what I said here some thought, and hopefully you'll get your little noggins jogging about how the rest of the gaming community sees us and why we are so universally despised.

So I have a multitude of suggestions that I think would make fortnite more healthy! My first suggestion is to decrease the damage of pump shotguns but remove the timer/delay it takes to switch from shotgun to shotgun (bringing back double pump but in a balanced way). The tactical shotgun is also a shotgun that needs to be re-thought, because nobody uses it and it’s not very good. I either think this should be vaulted or increase the damage. Another thing epic games has really struggled with is making shotguns consistent! Shotguns really need to be consistent! They should be 120 headshot, and 80 below head. This of course means a person with better aim is going to kill somebody with 200 health in 2 shots and a person with worse aim, 3 shots.  Now that I’m done with shotguns, I think we need to tackle the fact that fortnite adds TOO MANY BAD ITEMS. There are so many useless items that don’t see play. So I think when releasing new items, they should remove it if it is not effective/not liked in a week. Also I have a suggestion for the bush and snowman, I think it should be removed as an item, but you can put on any bush/snowman from the ground/ fortnite map. Finally, here are my list of items that I think should be vaulted.
Dynamite
Bottle Rockets 
Chug jug 
Bush
Balloons 
Suppressed assault rifle 
Thermal scopes rifle 
Dual pistols 
Grenade launcher 


Finally, all I have left to say is thank you for reading, and I hope you like my suggestions! :)",FortNiteBR

Something recurring I see in seasons ( 4 - 7 ) is mini-locations, these location usually don´t stick around after the season, well mostly, the only “Mini” location that stuck around was Dusty Divot

These are the locations

&amp;#x200B;

Season 4 - Meteors

Season 5 - Stone Heads

Season 6 - Corrupted Areas

Season 7 - Expedition Outposts

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[NOTE : Some locations may have been removed](https://i.redd.it/j70u626bcth21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Yellow = Meteors

Red = Stone Heads

Blue = Corrupted Areas

Green = Expedition Outposts

&amp;#x200B;

Since season 5 these locations can spawn upto 3 chests with new mobility items

&amp;#x200B;

Season 4 - Meteors - Hop Rocks

Season 5 - Stone Heads - Rifts

Season 6 - Corrupted Areas - Shadow Stones

Season 7 - Expedition Outposts - Planes + Ziplines

# #2 - Season 8 Battle Pass

Not much is sure about the season 8 battle pass right now, but I will tell you about the likely amount of cosmetics, the possibility of the new item, and idea of the theme of the battle pass

&amp;#x200B;

\- 8 Skins ( Includes Prisoner )

\- 2 - 4 Pickaxes ( Including skin challenge pickaxes )

\- 4 Gliders

\- 5 or 6 Emotes ( Includes skin challenge emotes )

\- 5 or 6 Contrails ( Includes Overtime challenge contrails )

\- 2 Toys

\- 3 Music Packs

\- 6 Wraps

&amp;#x200B;

There is many possibilities for what the new item could be, in the files what it points to is Hats coming to season 8

The last thing I have to talk to you about is the battle pass theme, now many ppl have been speculating that the theme will be underwater, there is many things pointing to this

&amp;#x200B;

1 - The submarine in the snow biome

2 - Sprays in the battle pass

3 - Ppl think that the snow will melt and turn into water

# #3 - That's all it

Instead of needing to pick axe or shoot walls then replace with your own mats (a waste of mats) to heal up/continue to turtle in, can't all builds placed by previous owner that was eliminated by a player belong to the player that eliminated them? This would be huge for competitive gameplay by eliminating the waste of useful materials that can be used later in game. Of course a problem in this idea is in the duos/squads game modes. For duos/squads the solution would be to give edits to the person that killed the other person. Even on the same squad or duo, the teammate of those who have died will not be able to control the edits of their dead teammate as the player that got the elimination will receive edits. Obviously this will only take place when a player is completely finished, not knocked.

Epic is amazing but I'm very confused by this. Yes I am glad that I was able to purchase Smooth Moves with my extra V-Bucks, but they killed the battle pass. It no longer has that honor that seasons before did. The season 8 battle pass will be almost meaningless. All it shows is that you did 13 random tasks. The new default skin will be the Tier 1 skins. If someone sees one of those skins, they'll think of a default. They're giving up so much money but they can't even add a confirm purchase button for buying a 20 dollar skin! (Also, this does not get them more money, it just keeps people from buying V-Bucks) The V-Bucks have already been bought! Epic doesn't get cash when someone buys a 15 dollar glider. They get money from the V-Bucks it took to get the glider. And people won't just spend more money to spend it on the right thing. They get scared of the item shop and leave it completely, which takes away income. There's an Accidential Purchase option in the refund section. They're basically giving away why they do this. But it doesn't even work. People should have infinite refunds. This would help the item shop, because Epic won't lose money if people refund stuff for V-Bucks. With this, people won't be scared of the item shop and actually use it.

Anyway, back to my point. The battle pass destroys the respect for future battle pass owners. Over time, as more players cycle in and out of the game, these skins will become less common, but Lynx would be much more honored than whatever free skins come in next season. The overtime challenges should get you a skin, not seven. If they end up meaning just the free pass, that will hurt them even more. (If they did this everyone should get a refund) It should have been for battle pass owners only. I have no V-Bucks for next season and I have no refunds left. I used my last one yesterday. Also, when you hit tier 50, all players should get a blue skin in my opinion.

My point is, the battle pass for free was a bad choice, infinite refunds would help everyone, and the free pass needs something new.",FortNiteBR

Get better.,"I replied to someone that said that 30 percent of ttvs who kill him are cheaters. And all of the rest are no lifers. And how he can't have any fun because someone with 10+ kills. Always out plays him. (""Builds a hotel after one shot"" so fucking tired of hearing this one) someone told me to make my comment a post so here it is. 

Why should epic ""do something"" about someone who is good at the game. If you only play 10 hours a month (let's call it 5, 2 hour gaming sessions) or you take no time to practice or improve when you know you're way behind even an average player.  then you should get clapped every single time by someone better than you. I honestly don't understand this argument and I hate to be the ""get gud"" guy. But epic has implemented sooo many ways to physically improve your game without being in a real match. E.G. playground, creative, big teams modes, there's practice courses, building courses, edit courses. There's plenty of room for someone to improve their game. It's a hard game that takes skill. Epic has catered to the casuals for so damn long and with the health/Mats on kills and plane nerfs the skill gap has widened and the game has became more competitive again. The better player should come out on top everytime. That's the way a skilled game works. People who practice and get better should be shitting on someone who never plays. With other games it's no big deal. Like cod for example. If someone gets in a match and they're getting wrecked they leave and move on no big deal. Or die 30 times and there's respawn so also no big deal. But in a game with one life with an infinite amount of ways the game can play out and a high skill ceiling (because of building) then you shouldn't get kills and wins handed to you. I agree with everyone else because I want ranked and I'm so damn tired of casuals complaining about getting wrecked. Also not everyone with ttv or 10+ kills us a cheater or no lifer, I literally play this game two times a week maybe 6 hours altogether. And I consistently drop over ten kills and my new record I got the other day was 18 in a solo. And o was stoked on it because I worked hard for it. Grinded my skills since season 2. Push fights.

Like for real. It's a hard game. I took the time to get as good as I have and that's why I'm good enough that I get ""fucking sweat"" hate messages and shit.

With updates like heal on kill (actual kill incentive) and with Apex taking a lot of the players, I’ve felt like the game is so much more, as much i hate to say it, sweaty. You have to be at the top of your game every match it seems, and it’s *exhausting*. I go to work, I come home and I just want to have fun playing a game. Now it’s just: get on, die to someone with tv in their name, watch them flex their 90s, repeat. Now that Apex is out, I’ve noticed so many more REALLY good players, because I think the people who are tired of getting destroyed every game are going to move elsewhere.

Call me crazy, but i think that so many people playing like there’s money on the line because i feel in part the game’s proliferation on streaming media, namely Twitch. So many players seem to have this mentality that you have to play just like the streamers, you’ll be the next big star. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be better at a game - but when such a seemingly huge part of the player base is trying this hard, it kills the casual game, which used to be the fun game.

I would go so far as to say Twitch kills a lot of casual gaming in general - Apex blew up, it’s barely been out for a week and I tried it out the other day and within a few games got killed by someone with close to 1,000 kills on that legend. Everybody wants to be the best... just *play* the game for what it is, a game... or give those of us who want to do that an option that isn’t disco domination and 50v50. 

I just want to hop on solos or duo/squad with my friends and play with people who are the same skill level as me. Ranked = happy game. The sweats can play against sweats, noobs can play against each noobs, average players can play against average players. When I die I’d rather die thinking “Oh man I shouldn’t have been in that spot blah blah” not “From the start of that fight I was utterly and hopelessly out matched by someone who I assume plays like 8 hours a day.” Ranked pls",FortNiteBR

I'm a less-than-prolific gamer who's been playing Fortnite for about a year now. I've still been averaging only about 1-2 kills per game and though I've gotten coming 2nd down to a science, I still lose about 80% of those games. 

Since the release of the Infantry Rifle, I've been able to play the game much more to my strengths, and it's shown. No joke, I've been racking up mostly 5-8 kill games now, as the rifle has been a huge benefit to landing in crowded open spaces like Loot Lake, and catching people off-guard. If you're landing in Tilted Towers, I get why you'd think the rifle is terrible. But for those who spend most of their games out in the open, it's been a godsend.

In short, there's more than one way to play Fortnite, and sometimes certain weapons benefit some more than others. That's what makes a game fun and effective.",FortNiteBR

I know that today,  february the 20th I think,  Apex is more popular dan Fortnite based on Twitch viewer count numbers, what doesnt mean that fortnite hasnt got Any viewers. As a good temporary solution to this,  Epic Games made the good choice of making the season 8 battle pass free to get a part of their playerbase back. When the next season drops at the end of this month,  the results will in my opinion be very positive for Fortnite. As a reaction on that,  I also expect Apex to be more creative and try some innovative stuff to compete with Fortnite,  the next month will be crucial for the rise or downfall of Apex,  and to see if Fortnite will stay King of the Hill,  which I think will happen eventually,  wether Apex will also include seasons or not.

I used to complete all my challenges in rumble care free and now that its gone, im seeing the horrors.

I have played a total of 25 solo matches and not even got a single chest. Either they dont spawn or someone just gets to them before me even after i know where the chest is. The latter seems to happen more often.

Its not fun to do this epic because u've literally made a single location with 5 chests into total chaos. I don't have much time to play and when i do i like to chill with a friendly squad and just enjoy completing challenges but this one has killed an hour of mine today and im still stuck on 0/7 chests/ammo boxes searched.

I actually feel bad for the creator of this block since i really like its design and i'm pretty sure the creator has no say in chest spawns.

Call me a noob or downvote me but this is my opinion. I would like to hear yours too. :)",FortNiteBR

Blank shotgun hit markers. Not having your shot register is one of the most frustrating things in this game and when it gets you killed it leaves you sitting there scratching your head. The last 2 weeks have been atrocious. It seems every other close quarters engagement i get into I get at least one blank hit marker. Has Epic said anything regarding this issue, has it been acknowledged? Every shotgun shot counts in this game and I feel it has existed long enough for things of this nature to not exist anymore.

FortniteBR is - as the name says - a BattleRoyale. That means no respawning, last man standing wins. If i want to play a Game with Respawn i can play Call of Duty. Theres no thrill to it. No meaning in surviving, if you just respawn. 

&amp;#x200B;

So can we pleeeease get at least a 20 v 20 next weekend? Or something like that? Maybe a 10 v 10? Would be cool either. Heck i'd even love an 8 v 8. Just something bigger than 4 v 4. 

&amp;#x200B;

Solo, Duo and Squad are just no fun for casuals that want to play some BATTLEROYAL (not some respawn sh\*t). Give us baaack 50 v 50!!!!!! How can you ignore us, Epic! I see posts like this multiple times a day! Why are you so stubborn! Do you hate your playerbase?! ",FortNiteBR

However, all these new patches and nerfs are ruining this game. This game is getting one-dimensional. The shotguns are utter garbage, why is it that we only get 12 rockets now? Fucking stupid. 
Adding a stink bomb that does like 5 damage per tick. (I think it’s actually 10)
Why keep adding this shit? They’re not fixing what’s wrong with the game. It’s getting boring.

Let me say at first: this is not a post to complain or wine about Fortnite. Not at all. The problem is that I have been struggling lately. If been playing since september, with a stop between the end of October and the end of december. I would call myself an above average player with over 450 wins and a usual 5-12 kills per game. Sometimes 15+. But that isn't relevant at the moment. Lately, since about a week, if been struggling when playing Fortnite. For some reason I just keep getting killed in fights where I used to be the winner. This especially happens in shotgun fights. My aim is completely off target and the more I get killed the less confident I get. Did something really happen with sensitivity? Do you guys have the same issue? Or are people just way better than before? Is keyboard and mouse getting very common (I'm playing on console)?

Again: I'm not complaining nor am I looking for excuses. I'm just wondering what is going on with either myself, the game or other players. If accepted that my peak maybe has ended haha.",FortNiteBR

First they reduce rocket ammo drops which was understandable, but now they've capped rocket ammo storage to 12. Just 12. I'm a Grenade Launcher user and it pained my heart to read these words as my beloved dual grenade launcher airburst strategy has now become irrelevant.

I understand the nerf to the point that explosive weapon spam in the later circles is a 'problem'. But isn't that how battle royale games work? 

Here's my thoughts
*As the number of players decreases so does the loot pool, people pick up better weapons and the last group of players have good loot because that's how BR games work. Of course people have rockets and explosive weapons in the end game because its logical to pick up better weapons.
* We've already nerfed rocket drop rates into the ground and it's a struggle to even muster 20+ rockets while constantly begging teammates to drop their rockets. If I so happen to have an enormous amount of rockets thanks to a dozen kills then I 'earned' those rockets. Or I was lucky enough to find a llama or be blessed by RNGesus. BR games have an element of luck that transcedes all skill and luck affects every player in an equal manner, unfairly. A first time player is just as likely to find an explosive weapon from a chest, the only difference is the relative degree of skill involved in surviving to open more chests or have more opportunities to acquire one. Why should 'skilled' players be punished in a way for surviving to see opportunities to get rockets and explosive weapons?
*I do see some value in the nerf in that every shot needs to be calculated and valued and that increases the skill ceiling of explosive weapons because spray and pray is no longer an option in any situation ever. Meaning that in order to use your 18 shots effectively you need the same amount of prediction and focus as a Bolt Action.

I'm an experienced Fortnite PC player and I've recently decided to start playing more frequently on the Nintendo Switch version. However, I've noticed that there are enormous differences in controller performance when playing via handheld and docked via a TV. 

Using the joycons attached to the device in handheld mode feels far more responsive and the sensitivity feels a lot more natural within game. Aiming is easy and building is a lot more accurate. However when I choose to use the joycons separately or with a pro controller via the TV, the 'feel' is completely off (this includes using a wired connection to the console). I can feel the tiniest bit of input delay between the control and console often causing overcompensation when I'm aiming or trying to pick up items. It's incredibly frustrating.  

I've double checked the control settings in both modes to see if anything is automatically changed but so far my investigation has come up trumps. There doesn't seem to be any factor within my control that I can change to ensure the controller performance and settings are the same to create a smooth transition between modes.

Llama nerf was great for solos but shit for squad mode, shotgun nerf is pissing me off because instead of hitting a 9 damage shot and then headshot I’m hitting the dreaded 9 damage shot and the a 50 even tho I watch my replay and my reticle is over the dudes fricken head, material nerfs overall are frustrating me and causing me to have a bad game experience because I spend majority farming and even then I still can’t farm enough brick or metal so I end up going into end game with 8 kills and 700 mats which frustrates me because I then have to deal with two people who also use up all their mats and leave me nothing. 

I’m just getting extremely frustrated with the changes in this game I understand the idea of a shotgun nerf but if you are to nerf it at least fix ur pellet damage problem which causes the most retarded of damage numbers. 
And maybe listen to Daequan and remove pump delay and bring in a new shotgun that can one tap people but only has two slugs before u have to reload (it’s sorta easy to find but not super common and it’s has a delay) but if ur gonna nerf the pump at least remove the delay 

If your going to nerf llamas nerf them for solos 200, duos 300 and squads 500 because in squad mode how am I supposed to share mats with my squad when I only get 600 and they all have to spend time farming, let me fricken play the game and not farm for 60% of it.

Buff brick and metal farming a massive truck or container should not give me 20 metal it’s not a stupid floor spawn. 

End game rocket nerf was awesome I do not care I rarely use the rockets because it’s a none skill weapon and I like a challenge. But maybe increase the ammo capacity to 18

Servers issues have been plaguing me and many of my mates where I’m just running around the map not bumping into any other player and I suddenly get 2000 ping can’t move and then go back to normal multiple times in a row (on a side note my internet is ridiculously fast and this was not in peak time) every update they brag in the patch notes about how they are fixing their servers and making improvements.... well it ain’t helping because it’s getting worse.

Custom button mapping for console... hurry up like for real some of ur builder pro button assignments are complete trash.

Overall I feel that epic is headed down a path where they are going to ruin their most profitable and popular game by pushing away its core community in favour of noob beginner players and they are not headed down a path where their giant money stash is going to promote any form of competitive play. 

If they actually fixed the game to allow for high tier skill players to be rewarded for their plays but at the same time give noobs the opportunity to get better at the game it would be perfect but at their current rate they are doing neither.

If epic actually reads this post (which I doubt because they only comment when people making “amazing plays”) then I hope they start to listen to their community and fix their game because I have never played a game that I’ve fallen in love with like this one and if they ruin it for me and all the other core players imma lose my goddamn mind!",FortNiteBR

I believe that Epic Games is slowly trying to remove the skill gap between new and experienced players to make it a much better game for the new players as they are able to compete with those who have been playing a long time. This is likely a good business strategy for Epic Games to make profit but, ultimately, is a slap in the face to those players who have put in a large amount of time and effort to become good at the game.



Evidence:


The latest materials nerf that epic games has implemented. This included reducing the number of farmed materials in Limited Time Modes and reducing the amount of a material you get from a floor/chest drop from 30-20. It is clear from this nerf that they are attempting to move the game in a direction that is away from the build meta. I personally believe this is a mistake because without the building, Fortnite is just a worse version of every other Battle Royale game due to it's gunplay (which will be further discussed). Building is also the biggest advantage that a good player has over new/less skilled player. This means that getting rid of the build meta will create a smaller skill gap between skilled and unskilled players.


Gunplay is the most essential element of any battle royale game and, aside from the snipers, the majority of the gunplay with AR's etc aren't heavily skill based. Almost all the automatic weapons have bloom which means that the bullet doesn't go exactly where you point your crosshair. This isn't a bad thing as most games do this, but instead of bloom they have recoil and spray patterns which you are able to learn or bullet drop you are able to learn and calculate. Fortnite has gone with the lazy option which reduces the skill gap between skilled and unskilled players by making the path of the bullet for these guns based on RNG. This means you can easily be lasered by a player less skilled than you as long as they have better luck than you, rewarding the player who has put less time and effort into the game. Of course it could be the other way around and the skilled player could be the lucky one but even if you put yourself in a position and have better aim than the opponent you will still lose the fight 20%+ of the time when in reality it should be far closer to 0%. 
The most recent shotgun nerf, in my opinion, wasn't that bad as it means a new player is less likely to get a lucky shot for 200+ damage in; however, I still think that the shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent, this inconsistency reduces the skill gap between players which is of course not a good thing for people who have put in a large amount of time to get good at the game. 


Damage trap buff. They require little to no skill yet even an extremely good player doesn't have the time to check every surface for a trap. They do 150 damage which is too much considering you could have full health and popped 2 minis, take no damage in a fight, yet still be killed by a trap they left behind which you didn't hear them place. This, once again, is rewarding the less skilled player and decreasing the skill gap.



Suggestions: My suggestions would be to

a) Increase the number of materials, at least by 1.5x. Materials found in loot should also be increased. This will once again increase the skill gap between players who have mastered building and those who haven't. This will allow the skilled players to more often survive encounters with unskilled players (which should be happening).

b) Remove bloom from the game. Honestly, I don't even know why it is still in the game and is the most obvious example of Epic capping the good players potential with the automatic weapons. Instead perhaps introduce some basic spray patterns. Hitscan or not I am not sure. This will mean that the new players will still be able to use the weapons with some degree of efficiency but it will still take skill to master the spray patterns etc. and become good.

c) Make shotgun damage more consistent. I don't know how Epic would go about this in a fair way but somehow the shotgun damage needs to be far more consistent so that if you are correctly landing your shotgun shots on target they do the same amount of damage and the only factor which could change this is the distance you are from your target. This will means skilled players will be able to get more consistent damage and therefore win more encounters with unskilled players.

d) Reduce spike trap damage from 150DMG to 100DMG. This means that if you haven't properly looted/killed enough enemies with good loot you are able to be one shot by a spike trap; therefore, punishing the player for not having sufficient health. This change will also mean that if you have shield you will survive a spike trap encounter, yet it will still leave you with minimal healthy. This will punish you for not having seen the spike trap but won't make you have to restart the game all over again.


Thanks for taking the time to read and any suggestions are much appreciated. If you don't agree please don't downvote but comment your own suggestions.

From my own prior knowledge, a game can't die down within a few months. Ill be considering three common accusations I have seen.

**Comparing Fortnite to other unpopular games to show that games can die out quickly-**

People are quick to point out that, for example, ""Pokemon Go died out within weeks/months, so Fortnite too has the ability to die out quickly"" which is true somewhat. Pokemon Go died out in a few \*months\* but people treat it like it was two or three months at max for its death. Pokemon Go ""died"" in about 8-9 months after release. Pokemon Go has depleted in popularity, sure, but the fanbase and the actual game are still very strong (many people still play the game, actually) and plus with the quote on quote ""revival"" of the game at E3 as it is going to be compatible with the switch now.. Yeah. Using Pokemon Go as a counterargument doesn't really work.

**Claiming that bugs ruin the game and make it ""literally unplayable"" (lol)-**

Others also point out that bugs and inconsistenty and nerds to things are driving players away from the game which is complete bullshit. The game is not UNPLAYABLE. Is the game, having these issues and all, that much annoying to the point where you can't stand to play it? It really blows my mind that people say these things.. people also tend to forget that the game is still in **BETA.** Bugs and constant changes are to be expected, and if you didn't expect the game to be squeaky clean, then please go away due to your argument being utterly invalid IMO. Epic has to experiment with things to see how it weighs against other things - take the materials nerd for example. Consider that a ""phase"" the game is undergoing, as it will probably return to the old material gain very soon due to community backlash.

**Saying that the community will, or already has, ruined Fortnite-**

""The game will die out because of how blatantly obvious the \[noun/advective\] levels are high"" is something many people are also very speedy to say assume. Just because most of the fanbase consists of kids (weirdly enough because it's a shooter game and STW contains ""bad language"") doesn't mean it will die out.. because apparently kids ruin the game and scare off older players..? So what if they aren't mature? So what if many kids play the game? Referring to children as being the source of downfall of a game due to them being inconsiderate and such makes you yourself look like the child. Generally when playing if I come across someone who is young I don't really care as it doesn't take away from the core fun of the game. If I find a kid IRL that is doing something Fortnite related, I consider that cute and not cringey. 

Apparently the Fortnite fanbase can be toxic because of how, as previously stated, buggy the game is. Do I agree with this? Yes, somewhat, if you consider people on Reddit complaining about already known bugs nonstop. But that is not something that can be considered toxic, that's called wanting to get something fixed to improve gameplay a.k.a. ""helping"" bugs get known and widespread so that the devs can see it. If you say that's toxicity, I'm completely fine with that if you're OK being a hypocrite. Constantly we get these posts complaining/recognizing bugs, but whilst over here we have people who complain about the complainers, bringing even more attention to the bugs they wanted people to stop posting about.

**TL;DR: Try reading paragraph two. People need to stop comparing Fortnite to unpopular games to claim that they will die due to that reason, people need to stop stating that the game will die to bugs, people need to stop saying that the community is toxic for stupid reasons (possibly being inexperienced with the community and viewing it as ""something popular = toxic"")**",FortNiteBR

- You cannot directly damage players.

- Grenades can be held in bigger stacks
- Increased materials from anywhere you can get them
- Impulses have the same amount of power that they had on April fool's day

This would make for super creative plays with impulse grenades, traps, etc. You can use c4 to bring down an enemy base on a hill and then follow up with an impulse to knock them way down the hill to their demise. You can chuck a couple of grenades at the bottom of a build battle (if that would work in this game mode).

Here's what I've thought up of.

1. Sneak Attack. If you sneak up behind an opponent in crouched position and aim your crosshair at the head of your target, you'll make a slam attack for 40 damage. (80 against shields)
2. Circles. Like how you do 2x damage if the cursor is at circle, you'll do 20 damage if you hit the circle on your opponent. This can be made to do 40 damage against shields, viable for demolishing your opponent's shields before finishing off with your shotgun.
3. Increase the attack range. It's difficult to land a hit on your opponent. This could be a good way to make up for the fact that pickaxes only do 10 damage.",FortNiteBR

It’s very difficult for players who are not skilled enough in building it be able to play effectively. I personally love building because it benefits me. But that’s the thing, if Fortnite ever expects to grow, it needs to be able to captivate new players, but atm I cannot see myself liking this game if I was a new player. I started playing back in October, so I’ve been adapted to every little change as it comes so it’s been like climbing a staircase. Whereas for a beginner from today, it’s like having to climb a cliff with no hands or feet. 

Now this doesn’t mean that epic needs to limit building, as counterintuitive as that sounds. But instead I think rn is the most important time for a ranked base matchmaking. We didn’t need it back in February and everything because the skill gap was manageable but we are gonna need it before it becomes too large. Just imagine how skilled some of the community is gonna be in 3 more months. And 3 more after that. And now imagine seeing No Skin Johnny pick up this game and comes across these types of players every single game. It’s gonna be impossible not to get frustrated and I can see new players start to decline. 

A ranked system that is done correctly will A) benefit an already hungry competitive fan base and B) benefit those who literally have 0% chance at winning. It gives beginners a staircase to climb again instead of a mountain in terms of skill. 

TLDR: The skill gap is way too large and is continuously growing because of how effective building is in this game. Ranked could be a nice way to help ease worse players into a higher skill gap and it would help higher skilled players too. ",FortNiteBR

Ironically enough, some time later everyone started hyping it up because of the guitar (Six String) backbling. Literally so many of you started begging for it to return to you could pick it up. All of the people who once thought that it was ugly and not worth buying, suddenly started begging and crying for it.

Let's be serious here, you have skins such as the Highland Warrior which was a holiday exclusive along with the Battle Hound. The Battle Hound was never released AFTER the initial holiday it was meant for, but the Highland Warrior skin was as it wasn't hyped up as much down the road. Most people want the Battle Hound and have been crying for it to return because ""why not release it if you release the highland warior?"" There's a simple reason, hype around it.

And I just wanna make this clear before I truly finish. **I own neither of these skins**, and now this is just a theory of mine. Some of you might agree, some might not.

**2:** If you've made any recent purchases for a Sony product that you are not happy with, [Request refunds](https://support.us.playstation.com/articles/en_US/KC_Article/Requesting-a-Refund). Whether it's Fortnite or something entirely different.

* Please be civil with Sony customer support employees. Most of them have no control over this situation. They are just normal people trying to do their jobs.  


**3:** If you want to help, but you are not a Playstation user, then do us a favor by directly supporting their competition.  If you have any extra cash, and you want  anything on the Xbox/Switch market places, use this as an excuse to spoil yourself a little for the good of the gaming community. If you play Fortnite on PC, but you're linked to either Switch or Xbox, maybe pick up some V-Bucks on one of those platforms.  


**4:** Don't forget this! We're probably getting the next wave of consoles in 2020. Tell Sony, [via tweet](https://twitter.com/Sony), or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sony/), that if they don't step up and make this change that many of us may change to Xbox, Switch, or PC for the next generation.  


**5:** Support content creators that are circulating this information. [Greg Miller long time host of #1 Playstation Podcast called out Sony.](https://twitter.com/GameOverGreggy/status/1008832972936495104) When you see content like this retweet it, comment on it, use hashtags, and provide links in your tweets so that the people that the people that see your tweets becomes armed to further spread this message.

I was a sparkle specialist with the Royale shield and bat sickle. 

(I HAVE REPLAYS TURNED OFF TO LOWER MY PING. THIS SOMEHOW HELPS, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.) 


  You saw I was a sparkle, and you decided to floss to get my attention. I started dancing too, and at that moment, we became best friends.
  I saw you had no shield, so I dropped you two minis. Then we kept dancing to wait out the storm while our friends were contemplating what we were doing. Finally, the storm closed in and the second to last circle was all the way near Loot Lake,  Tilted side. 
  I saw one of our friends got downed, so I went to Rez him, but it was too late. Some dick on our team downed him and left him to die.
  The moment we get in to the circle is when all hell breaks lose. 
  Our team spots a supply drop, so you go for it while I watch you. I did a thorough perimeter scan and we were good, so you opened it. I had some lag, and then when it was done, we were ambushed.
  All the teams started shooting at us. Our numbers, which were once a strong 18, dwindled to a measly 6. Me, you, and two defaults were among the four. (Shoutout to the defaults as well, you guys helped us out a lot)
  Some asshole decided to use a grenade launcher on us, downing the three of you. For some reason, I wasn’t effected. In the midst of this, two of our six guys died, making our numbers just us four.
  I built a wall around all of you and rezzed you first until an OMEGALUL decided to break in to my 1x1. I downed him and went to revive you.
  You revived the others while I provided support. Sadly, the other teams saw our 1x1 and drilled in to our base. Again, the three of you were downed and GLAsshole decided to throw more grenades, killing the three of you.
  I use an impulse to get myself the hell away from there as I’m the only guy left on our team. I saw you spectating me, hoping I could win. 
  A Visitor spotted me, The Sparkle Specialist, in her glory. So, he decided to spray me down. When one person sprays, more decide to spray. I downed him and two others and killed them for you. 
  And... GLAsshole comes out and throws his grenades while I’m healing. Boom. Dead.


  Love ranger, I failed you. Your description reads “Hit them in the heart.” I did. But it failed. They hit you and the three others in the heart. 
  Love Ranger, my guardian angel, my dance companion, my friend, my ally, my savior. Goodbye, and I’m sorry.

Almost infinite customization ability. You ca first choose between 8 character models, then 40 uniforms, and then 99 numbers.
2. Price- 1200 vbucks
3. Versatility. Because of the soccer skin's 40 kits, you can run them with practical any back bling and harvesting tool and still have a matching look. For example, if you use the New Zealand Kit, your character has an entirely black uniform which looks wonderful with the Oracle Axe and battle Shroud Back Bling. 
4. They use newer character models instead of the default models. 
5. While they are not necessarily rare, (they may become rare if they are only for world cup) your skin can be more unique than any other skin based on your customization choices and black bling/ harvesting tool choices.

the only downside is that the country list is not accurate to the world cup, which allows Epic to undermine and weaken any legal actions FIFA would want to take against them for using a world cup theme without approval. FIFA has a copyright on the world cup, but not on soccer and countries color schemes. This is also kind of a good thing because New Zealand has one of the most badass kits (all black) and they didn't make it. ",FortNiteBR

The shotguns absolutely invalidate every other weapon that isn't explosives or AR. When you land from the battle bus, the very first stage of the game is: 1. Find shotgun or 2. Kill the guy with the shotgun and take his shotgun.

Why when you pick up any other weapon your first thought is ""I really need to find a shotgun."" or ""I hope I don't run into someone with a shotgun right off the bat.""

#Before we go any further, this is the meta:

- AR, Two shotguns, Sniper/Explosives, Heal/Shields.

For a weapon that is so vital to the point where you drop everything else to hold it in your inventory, why is it also among the most common weapons in the game?

[Here's a few images, I literally went to twitch and clicked the first few streamers that weren't in lobby.](https://imgur.com/a/A6i29Pe) This isn't to say the meta should change, this is just to point out that the Tactical SMG, the LMG, the Supressed SMG, the Supressed Pistol, the Pistol, the Deagle, literally no where to be found. And I don't think I captured people holding explosive weapons but that's not really the point I'm trying to make. The current hierarchy of weapons is known.

EVEN IF the argument is to be made that the other weapons just aren't as good, should it really be so easy to have the best in slot weapon? I'm not saying get rid of them but it would definitely make early game more interesting to have Magnum SMG battles knowing that at some point you're unlikely to get effortlessly smashed by someone using the easiest weapon in the game when you have limited access to materials.

Thoughts on shotgun rarity? Is it totally fine to have several weapons be completely useless / nonexistent because literally everyone can effortlessly find multiple shotguns every single game? What about trying a limited time mode where the shotguns are purple / gold only?

Any and all feedback welcome.

TLDR: Shotguns common, every other weapon invalidated by how easy it is to find shotguns.

·Bloom.......Bloom is basically the most get lucky thing in the game why is it still here it shouldve been gone back after week one 

·Building Mats.....like why?why should we spend 1/5 of the match farming.Why?


·Shotguns......... Personally i agree shotguns shouldn't one shot you when you have full health and sheild but please,please make them consistent. We should get the kills based on our skill/ aim and not get 20 headshots with pump. Heavy shotgun is the only good shotgun atm and ofc its puple/gold. Just please fix them

·Stop catering noobs......the reason of the building nerf was to cater noobs who cant build. Stop trying to get the people like me who have been grinding to get good at the game since launch stop building. Its true, if noobs are good they will keep playing, its a good business move but that is just a dick move to do to the loyal ogs that have been playing since launch. Playground will help the noobs so release it already.

I've seen people on here get shot down  constantly for voicing concerns over too many rockets at end game. They're told to adapt, and that people earn those rockets(which in a lot of cases, is false). The llama nerf for explosives was a great change. 60 more rockets in play was horrible for the game. I also think a cap on rockets is necessary for the end game.

Most gameplay changes I actually live through with and adapt to.

But what I just don't understand is why people feel the necessity to dance on, or taunt, each and every single **fucking** person that they eliminate in this game. It tilts me more than the Towers. At least the fights that occur there are a show of honour and skill, for the most part, and not childishness like what I just exhibited last game. It has happened to me numerous times before, and, being a person who usually has trouble controlling their anger, I have come dangerously close to smashing gaming equipment against the hardwood floor, but somehow I always contain myself by an inch and I'm barely ever vocal about it. Not always am I angry playing this game; if I had the opportunity to say 'GG' after a good fight to someone, I would, but of course you can't. But if I could, I think I'd do it pretty often.

So last game, I was running out of Pleasant after having scavenged the things off the one dude that I bagged. It wasn't a good game, because I was just taking leftovers or what was in small, unlooted areas, since the circle of autumn trees that I landed on had no chest atop it. Then, around Loot Lake, I had an encounter with a guy who was double sniping. I had a Hunting Rifle, but since he was building higher, I decided to start hard peaking on him with a Burst Rifle. Just as I was crouching again, his bullet miraculously punctures through my brain and grey matter goes everywhere, while I imagined a blue '100' and a big, yellow '162' appeared on the screen for him.

So I've died. I wasn't really that mad at that point, since it was an admirable shot, he had 6 kills, and it was my last game before my older brother, who is due for military reserves training after we both finish our exams, had me pack up the PS4 for him to take to his grandmother's once he was finished work. However, it was at that point that he decides to take out the popcorn bucket, and start tossing handfuls at his mouth, as if my death was a form of entertainment to him; like a carnival or something. It felt like I was being used as laughing stock, that I was being mockingly patronized or whatnot. And I kept my rage barely bottled up while my brother laughed in the background.

Alright, my rant is done. I just felt that it was totally unnecessary to taunt players all the time. I barely ever use emotes in game, besides the 'Good Game' sticker and Respect when I have the chance. I find a few emotes just funny, and not tilting at all (ex. Red Card), but the majority of them heat up my blood. What do you think? Do I need anger management classes? Should I just accept the fact that it's going to happen no matter what I do, since the emote system is pretty unique? (that is, forgetting TF2 and Overwatch exist) Or should I buy a pair of girl's extra small white panties from a clothing store, write 'TRY HARD' on the crotch in black sharpie, and wear those every day so I can remain extra dedicated?

If you need me, I'll be studying.",FortNiteBR

All this does is encourage all players on all 5 teams to camp and hide all game long. This is a BATTLE ROYALE! By definition, that means a fight or contest that is decided by the last remaining team/contestant. I don’t say this lightly, but, after all the changes they have made to resource gathering and the constant flip flopping of nerfs and buffs, I’ve seriously considered just uninstalling the game. I say this as a person that plays daily for at least an hour and a half each session.

This is just my own opinion that I want just to say.  I don't really care if you leave a comment that says something negative about this post.  This is probably going to trigger you that you will turn salty.**

    FYI, I made a post why Fortnite is impossible to win.  I notice that post was very short so I just deleted that post and created a longer post.

1. The game play is so confusing and very difficult, especially staying alive is difficult.  You have around 99 players drop down of the bus, trying to see where to land but the players are all over the place that I cannot even see a clear place to land.  Sure I could try waiting a little more longer to land but I still see players all over the place.  I go down and land, get some resources for building, fell down and then a couple shots then I'm dead.  There are no easy or no hard, you just need to hope that the person you are about to kill is new to the game.  Speaking of being new to the game, when you first play you are like an exp farm waiting to get killed on your first couple of games.
2. Salty replys.  Every time I make a negative claim on Fortnite I see someone saying ""Your probably bad at this game"".  Like seriously, all I see is ""Your bad at this game"" and no other criticism.  When you new to a game you need to learn the basics of the game.  But in Fortnite it is very difficult to learn the basics (See number 3).
3. Going back in number 2, it is very hard to learn to be good at this game.  The game just basically throw you in the game with new or pro players.  You don't know who you are going to encounter,  all you need to hope is that player is new to the game.  This is a problem in most PvP games.  No training, No fighting with other new players, just fight with pro players.  Its like if you just have a bat and you were fighting Iron Man.

Thats all I have to say about Fortnite, go ahead and leave a reply saying ""Your bad at the game though"".  That just means you did not read this or you don't understand.",FortNiteBR

Bloom isn't competitive. It's luck. Now, with BR games in general there is going to be some luck involved, I understand that. But why not take as much luck out of the game as possible. I don't think they should take bloom out and do nothing else though, I think the best thing to do would be to add predictable recoil. This way people who want to get skilled at the game can learn recoil patterns and hit more shots. I also can see that this might be thought of as a problem for new or more casual players, but honestly there missing shots because of bloom anyway. I don't think they should implement it overnight either we need another test mode so that recoil can be fine tuned. How do you guys feel about this and what are your suggestions?

We also know that this poses a threat to the map due to the emergency broadcasting systems being displayed on the TVs similar to last year. 

According to a leak that was posted here a month or so ago, Moisty Mire will be 80% gone by the end of this season, and a 50v50 game mode including a large Leviathan that must be escorted from Greasy to Wailing (making the bunker the possible end point of the gamemode). 

So, Moisty Mire will be hit. But why would a large super villain rocket want to target the least populated area on the map?

Well, here’s my thought. The missile is launched, set at a populated area on the map. Due to a recent post, someone found that the same rocket timer found in the villain base appears underneath Salty Springs(as I am making this post on mobile, I cannot simultaneously find the user who posted this, I will update it with full credit given after this is posted). 

So let’s say Salty Springs is set to be hit. But little do the Visitor and Omega and his gang know, but Carbide and the heroes have been keeping a close eye on them and must heed the call to action.
Obviously, missiles or rockets, when launched, give off a hell of a lot of heat. That’s where my new discovery comes into play.

Tantalum CARBIDE. Due to recent scientific discoveries, tantalum carbide is one of the most heat resistant metals in the world, withstanding up to 4000 degrees celsius of heat. So my theory is that Carbide, using his SUPER SUIT and his heat resistant armor, will successfully (Superman style) take the rocket out of mid air and retarget it towards Moisty, awakening the Monster of Moisty Mire, thus setting up the new game mode.

Well, that’s all! Sorry if this was a long read, but I tried to make it the slightest bit entertaining.

I have literally only used AR's and SMG's and my win rate has sky rocketed since I stopped playing with my RNG of shotguns. The scar can do 175 damage to the body without a headshot from close range for every one body shot with the pump. In between shots, the scar can shoot about 5 times before a pump shoots twice, and the pump NEVER one shots full shield. I have resorted to only using AR's at all ranges and SMG's. The heavy tac is the only viable shotgun in the game at the moment.

Honestly Epic, who in there truly thought it was a good idea to make the pump completely useless and have the heavy tac so much better? lets look at it:

Pump: Has a delay Shoots 2.5x slower than heavy tac body shots for 7-12 more damage than heavy tac headshots for max of 180 (I believe, not sure exact) has 5 shots

Heavy tac: 2.5x faster shooting no delay at all headshots for 192 max (makes complete sense right?) most consistent shotgun in the game, nearly always body shots for 73 Has about double the effective range of the pump

WHY is this okay? And no, this is not a rant to nerf the heavy tac. Its a post to show how stupid the difference between a pump and a heavy tac is. not even including the regular tac.

PLEASE, PLEASE make pumps do their job again. stop catering to those who actually never build and get one shotted for crouch walking up to someone building at them. Default skins complaining about getting one shot but never build or never do anything with any thought should get one shot for playing like that. The pump is now not rewarding at all, and super RNG even if you do hit a clean headshot.

Please epic, I trust you guys to do the right thing. Nerfing rockets was fantastic, now give us good players our short range back.

Past update :
* Removed from llamas (60 less per game. 3*20=x).
* Reduced drop rate by 50% in ammo crates. 
Today :
* Rocket Launcher reload time nerf.
* Max rockets to carry is 12. 


This means C4 was indirectly buffed once again. It's a blue rarity item so technically it falls onto the same field as the Grenade Launcher and Rocket Launcher although I've found it to be more common than those two items. 

As of right now C4 has a Radius of 600 and a full damage to items of 700(confirmed on the 100,000 health ice cream truck). 

Rockets did damage to walls aswell. Although depending on angle, only 1-4 max walls would take damage, with NO splash through. Same goes for Grenade Launcher. 

In a typical setting. With the current rocket nerf. It takes 120 wood to prevent taking damage from a rocket. 

With C4. It would take 600 wood to prevent taking damage from 10 C4 while someone using ONE C4 at a time on your building. 

Now if a player with C4 throws TWO onto your building. You WILL take damage. See where the balance is lost? 

This also incentives low ground. High ground is FAR too risky now. Players who can outbuild and outplay are being punished currently. Nobody will build fight, as one C4 can have you falling to your death. 

My proposal for the current C4 meta would be :

* Change the damage values that C4 does to **Player Built Structures** to a lower value so C4 may not directly ruin a player build structure. This will not apply to worldly structures like houses, cars, trees. 

* Remove splash damage through walls OR potentially make it 10% if it's original value. This way multiple C4 must be used to make it worth while. 


Either way with the nerfs of Rockets. I must say, if you see me in game, I'm going to abusing the hell out of C4. ",FortNiteBR

In the last few months, with the addition of other ""holidays skins"" (like the valentine's ones) and with the return of some of these skins in the shop, the posts, comments, videos about bringing back Skull Trooper have become a problem. 

Today Epic released in the shop the valentine skins one more time and there are an immesurable number of posts asking for the skull trooper to come back. 

The situation nowadays on EVERY social network, on EVERY post or comment from Epic, is that people keep spamming requests for skull trooper to come back, there's even a ""black market"" and people who contact you to ask you to buy your account because you have the skull trooper skin (it's happened to me too, on Reddit and in game)


I'm not here to give my opinion about it, I just want to ask to EpicGames to say ANYTHING about this situation and make clear if Skull Trooper IS or IS NOT coming back, during the next Halloween or ever and end this stupid debate.

I'm a fairly terrible player. I try hard, I watch and listen and read and have improved over time. These forums (as well as the subreddit) have been tremendously helpful. As with any forum on the internet there is often toxic language which is easily filtered. As I pour them looking for tips and guidance there has been one element that's been specifically painful.   


""Retarded.""  


My daughter has special needs. She's eight years old. Every day is a struggle, every day has its own rewards.  


When fairly intelligent (or at least competent) contributors use the word ""retarded"" it conveys a unique pain, a unique disdain, one that makes me want to stop pursuing getting better, stop digging through these forums, stop learning.   


Many of you won't care. But to those that may, and to those that are already positive contributors, I ask you to please, please consider what that word means.  


Calling someone ""retarded"" as in insult is to accuse the entire handicapped community as sub par. As worthy of insult. As something to be ridiculed.   


How you're born is out of your control. What you do with your life, hopefully, is another matter.   


So for those of you who are healthy, who have all your mental faculties, who can contribute - please do. And please know you'll make at least one person's world a better place by evaluating your own scorn a little more closely.   


Thanks, and look forward to giving you all my hard earned loot when I panic-build around my own grenades.

You just can't justify sacrificing a slot for Nades/Clingers/C4/Impulse/Boogiebomb/Port-a-Fort and now the new Stink Bomb for **late game** battles. Implementing a grenade slot for the items listed above would almost indirectly encourage fast paced play rather than camping in a 1x1 with a campfire under your ramp..

Epic, please just consider this. I know its been floating around for a while, but I feel like with the Stink Bomb introduced, it is a solid suggestion that would make players use these items the way they were intended to be used, not just left on the ground.

Also, since I'm raging...pls consider degrading the minigun/semi/handcannon to Epic Rarity so they do not fall from the sky in the ever so frustrating supply drops. These are the last guns we need for late game battles.

Fortnite takes place in the same universe as The Powerpuff Girls. Now, before you start ranting, hear me out. Fortnite has Thanos in it. Thanos is in Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite. Mega Man X is in Marvel vs. Capcom, and Mega Man X in the same universe as Mega Man, since Dr. Light created both of them. Mega Man is in Smash Bros, and so is Pac Man, who appears in Wreck-it Ralph. One scene in Wreck-it Ralph shows a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a comic book crossover with Batman. Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang show up in an episode of Batman. Scooby Doo, of course, has a crossover with Johnny Bravo. Johnny Bravo is in an obscure Smash Bros. ripoff for the Wii, called Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion. All three Powerpuff Girls show up in this game. Therefore, my conclusion here is that Fortnite does in fact take place in the same universe as The Powerpuff Girls.",FortNiteBR

My suggestion is that we should remove bloom but add some semi-difficult spray patterns. We could increase the skill limit a lot by just getting spray patterns into the game. The distance between bullets should be dependent on the range you are shooting at. Spraying from very far away will still be nearly impossible. New players or people who would usually  rely on luck can still do that, but atleast it would be more consistent.

It seems to be pretty polarizing, some people love the changes and some thing it needs to be nerfed. 

Personally I think it's way too strong (I think it's the strongest item in the game right now, better than the scar or heavy shotgun, at least at my level). It's banned in competitive scrims because of how strong it is. 

That being said, before the buffs, it was pretty worthless. I would almost never pick it up. So here's my idea to fix it without making it worthless again: make it drop in stacks of 1 (maybe with max stack size of 4 or 5). 1 c4 can destroy an entire build fight if placed correctly, you don't need 4 to do it. It will also clear out 3 floors of a big building in tilted. Why does someone need to have 4 of those with every drop. 

Make it like the boogie bomb and only drop it in stacks of 1. 

Side note: boogie bomb should also probably drop in stacks of 3 or something because it's not getting taken in stacks of 1 currently. That or make the radius bigger and leave it as 1.

Hey guys, next time you're raging at your tv/computer screen because you lost another match for any one of a thousand different reasons besides you stinking, I'd like you to think inward instead of outward.  I want you to resist the urge to come to r/FortNiteBR and complain about some nonsense why you lost.  I know, I know, everything revolves around you and you'd win every single match if they just fixed the double pump or the phase glitch or the rendering issue or the pickaxe delay or the damage dropoff or the auto assist or the building sensitivity or the c4 buff or the trap buff or the jetpack or the shopping cart glitch or the materials nerf.  God forbid you just.... adapted.  

 (!!!!!) The horror!!!!!

But why should you adapt to the game?!  Why shouldn't they specifically tailor it to your exact specifications so you never lose!?  Good question, I don't know the answer.  As I stated above, I already know that you're the center of the universe and I too think Epic should wake up and cater to you and only you.  But alas, they clearly aren't going to do that.  So, here's how your humble author has managed to survive since Season 2:

Shotguns:  First, double pump was meta and I was crushed by it constantly.  So... I learned to double pump.  And actually, it was difficult to master and extremely rewarding once I got it down and melted through early-game opponents like a hot knife through butter.  I got an extra little tickle in my balls as I imagined the guy I just killed screaming in his house ""THE FUCKING DOUBLE PUMP I HATE IT!!""  as his mom yelled at him to quiet down or lose his PS4 privileges.  I was sad to see it go.  But then it went.... so I stopped using it and got better with the pump/tac combo.  Nbd.  Now the double pump is kinda sorta halfway back and I alternate between double pumping and pump/smg loadout.  I've practiced with both, I'm good with both, it's all good.

Hunting Rifle:  the auto assist is clunky as hell.  I used to just not use these.  But then I thought to myself ""hey man, stop being a bitch and just practice.""  Now, the auto-assist no longer bothers me and the hunting rifle is my favorite gun in the game.  Don't let me get a blue hunting rifle or it's curtains on these fools.  Every time I'm in a sniper shootout with some poor sap with a bolt I cackle maniacally, growing louder and louder until my neighbors hear me over their tv and say to each other ""damn, guess OP found another blue hunting rifle, its curtains for those bitches.""  At least that's how I imagine it happens.  And why am I able to snipe faces like Private Daniel Jackson with the hunting rifle on console?  Bc I just practiced and got gud with it instead of begging Epic to change it.

Building:  used to get built on like crazy and got absolutely pwned.  Did I bitch about how fortnite building is cheap and overused?  Hahaha COME ON, don't make me cackle maniacally again.  Of course I didn't.  I learned how to build ffs.  Now, if you should EVER be so unlucky as to see me strolling out of Wailing Woods in an actual game, you should just drop all your loot and assume the position.  By the time your eyeballs send the message to your brain that an exceedingly good-looking Midnight Ops enemy is headed your way - I'm already in a literal replica of Fort Knox.  By this point I've already clipped 2 of your teammates with the hunting rifle and absolutely bundled the 3rd with a double pump and am now descending on you from above like a peregrine falcon.  ""How is he able to do this?!"" - you wonder as you get one-tapped for 190 - ""He must have complained to Epic on Reddit until they tailored the game for him!"" - you think.  WRONG!  I just accepted the parameters of the game and practiced within the limits set by epic.

Building materials:  Epic reduced building material gainz.  So i just chop a few more trees.  Jesus, relax about the materials they're fine.

Jet-Packs:  Thought to myself ""hey these might be cheap"" when they dropped.  But then I remembered my mantra - ""Stop being a little bitch"" - and I started strapping on jet-packs and figuring them out.  By sunset of the day they were released I had actual fan mail in my inbox from Boba Fett.  That's how good I got with the jet-pack.  Then they vaulted it and I said to myself ""well ok, that was fun while it lasted, time to go back to kicking ass on the ground.""

I have plenty more examples of me achieving great success by accepting that the world doesn't revolve around my personal preferences.  I'm happy to share upon request.   Happy hunting to the real ones out there.",FortNiteBR

Joining the Season this late is a huge disadvantage for all Switch battle pass owners. Especially the ones who only play Solo. I realize we can only get to Omega by playing Squads and getting the XP multiplier/group boost.

My suggestion would be this. As soon as you unlock the default Omega chestplate at level 65, you unlock 5 new and difficult challenges. Each of these challenges awards you with a colour for the chestplate. The easiest, though still difficult, challenge would unlock the defualt Orange/Red lights, and the other challenges would either give you one other colour or allow you to pick a colour of your choosing.

For example:

""Win 20 matches in any standard gamemode"" This would unlock the default colour skin. Only the default modes count because winning in 50v50 happens a lot.

""Win a match with atleast 15 kills"" The exact amount of kills could be higher, depending on how high you want the skill level to be, but I think 15 is a nice place to start. This challenge would either give you a predetermined colour or allow you to pick one of your choosing.

""Win 3 matches in a row"" Possible, but difficult. Again, number of wins can be higher, but 3 is a good place to start the discussion.

""Kill an enemy with every weapon in the game"" This one could either count every rarity as the same, or if you want it to be more difficult you could make it so you would also have to get a kill with every rarity.

""Loot 10 Llamas"" Not sure about this one, could think of another challenge, be sure to suggest another one.

I understand that this won't be added to Season 4 and I used Omega mainly as an example, but please Epic, do something like this for Season 5. ",FortNiteBR

One part FPSs usually not being my thing, one part werid thing with my brain. That said, I know when I've been out-classed, and when a game has a glaring flaw in it's design that's screwing me. Every game, at least on PC, is just crowds of people running around with inventories full of shotguns, and it's miserable.


For those unaware, it is significantly faster to switch to another shotgun in your inventory and fire, then to wait for the pump time in-between each shot from one shotgun.


This has resulted in people carrying nothing but shotguns and maybe one AR, and it's insanely over-powered. Not only because it creates an awful, one-sided, all-or-leave-match meta, but you have to hope and beg that you have multiple shotguns spawn near you, and that you can get to them before others do. Not so great when most of the time, I feel lucky to find a grey three burst in a whole house.


*I hate to sound over dramatic, * but this is so frequent now, that 4/5 people I kill drop multiple shotguns, and everyone who kill is carrying multiple shotguns. As a result, until it's fixed, I'm just not playing any-more. Many of my friends are doing the same.

Recently Epic has shown interest in the competitive Esports scene by announcing different events and tournaments throughout the year. Right now Fortnite is at its prime but in order for the game to continue at this pace it will need to have an interesting scene within esports. This is where bloom comes in. Bloom is not only catering to a lower skill gap but it is also way to luck based to function within an esports scene. If Bloom was removed and recoil patterns were implemented instead it would allow experienced players to learn the spray patterns which would lead to a higher skill gap. This would prompt more experienced players to continue playing the game instead of leaving it due to all the changes creating a low skill gap. Any game must have a large skill gap between newer players and more experienced ones, especially if it's a Battle Royale game.

To my dismay but no surprise (it was a  LTM after all) the 50vs50 game type has been removed again, and instead replaced with Final Fight (a horrible alternative take on the 5x20vs20 game mode imo, but that's a whole different story.)

I'm here to suggest Epic should make up their mind already on if they want to make 50vs50 permanent or not. And in my opinion it should be for 1 simple reason: From my experience it's the best game mode for new players to learn the ropes and get really into the game. I've been trying to get more of my gaming friends into Fortnite, since it can such an amazing experience to play in groups. However, in notice very few of them have the patience to learn the mechanics of the game, knowing they will constantly be pwned by even the most average players in solo, duos and squad matches. 50vs50 seems to give new players a chance to get familiar with part of the map, finding weapons and building without the fear of knowing they might take a shotgun to the back of the head at any second.

Anecdotally I've had 3 friends who gave up on Fortnite during the early months simply because the game was to punishing for them in solo, duos and squads. I should note they aren't hardcore FPS / TPS players. However, 2 of those friends gave the game another shot during the 50vs50 weeks and it's seems to serve as a gateway for them to feel comfortable entering any of the permanent game types. 50vs50 has given them a chance to practice aiming, building etc. 5x20vs20 does this to and extend, but not nearly with as much early-game security.

In my opinion Epic might be doing themselves a disservice by periodically removing 50vs50, potentially alienating new, inexperience players who might otherwise stick around.

I'm eager to know what the FortniteBR subreddit thinks about this. :)",FortNiteBR

Skins concepts
- Zombie friend: you start off as a normal man and as you win matches, get kills and earn XP while wearing the skin he levels up and turns more zombie like after each game. He also has a limp. 
- Hazmat suit: big, bright and yellow.
- Survivor no-skins: the original skins with twisted features including longer scruffy hair, beards, torn and dirty clothing. 
- Roach: a skin where you start of thee round looking like a normal healthy individual however as the game progresses you loose hair, and skin becomes blistered. 
- Infected: only the developers have access to this skin. Whoever kills a person wearing the skin will unlock it. 

Weather 
- A new addition to the storm is a radioactive dust cloud. The cloud will rain toxic radiation on you if you’re caught in its path (which is predictable). The rain has a poison effect that wears off over time. 
- Following the fallout the sky has changed colour to a green - yellow - orange tint depending on the time of day. 
- Mushroom clouds will appear on the horizon as the game progresses. 

Radioactive Super Powers 
- Similar to hop rocks, there will be canisters around the map where scientists have taken samples from the bomb site. These can make you run faster, swing your pickaxe faster (faster farming), switch weapons faster, and jump slightly higher. 

 New Location - Mole Town 
An underground town designed to survive the event of a nuclear incident, but watch out when the storm comes, you don’t wanna be trapped under there when it hits. 

Radioactive zones 
Careful when entering as too much exposure can cause serious side effects including death. High risk looting. 

Full button mapping 
Allowing players to alter their keys and controller settings to however they see fit. 

Playground 
Up to eight player online for practising your building, editing and shooting needs. Also enabled for offline play for when the server is down for maintenance.

Custom matches 
For 100 V-Bucks a week you can rent your own server. Gives you access to any weapon (including shelved weapons). Allows you to pick and ban any weapon. As well as alter ammo drops, chest spawning, and storm speed. 

High definition map
When you zoom in the map updates it’s detail. 

Friend Spectating 
While waiting for your friend to finish a match you can join the server and watch from their point of view.

As the title says, i think i found something really big regarding season 4 or even 5. 

Let me explain. At tier 97 of the current Battle Pass, you unlock an emoticion called ""**celebration**"". It shows some kind of **mexican dude** *(at least thats what it looks like to me.*). And at tier 87 you unlock the **""squad leader**"". If you look at the skin or his concept art loading screen, you can see that he has a tatoo, to me it looks like an **incan symbol**. As we know from season 3, emoticons and stuff might tease the next season. (*In season 2 there is even a gas mask player icon--hint at the new skin?*). So i decided to do a bit of research.

I looked at the german wikipedia article about incans.(I am austrian btw). And the more i read, the more stuff i found out. I have used google translator to show you the most important parts:

&gt; In the Andes each community, each tribe, had its own tradition, which  derived its origin from a sacred place, a sacred star or a sacred  animal.  
 All Andean peoples worshiped the sun and moon as a fertile couple.  
The  most important festival of the empire was the Inti Raymi, the **winter solstice** and the shortest day of the southern hemisphere on **23 June** of a  year.

This is already super interesting, because the 22/23 is just **3 days from now.** And today i saw a post showing a **countdown** on the rocket. And it was 3 days long! 

&gt;  
The **fortune-telling** had a crucial place in the Inca civilization. She was called before every action, and nothing important could be done without first catching up.

This might sound not very important at first, but if you think about the **Omen skin** this makes sense. The omen was part of the ""overseer"" set. And he is some kind of **clairvoyant.** His description says ""Your victory has been foretold"". He also uses an ""oracle axe"".

&gt;  
Prophecies were also made from the analysis of lungs daily in Cuzco sacrificed white llamas.  
On every important occasion a sacrifice was made. The most common **animal sacrifice** was a **llama**. At the end of the celebration of the Sun cult, many animal sacrifices were reported.

This part made is one of the most important ones, as it kinda creates the connection to Fortnite. We all know that the llama is the main animal of Fortnite.

&gt;  
According  to the research of William Sullivan, at sunrise, on the  **winter solstice** (= **June 22**), a bridge emerged between the horizon, the  **human world**, and Mayu (""river"", **Milky Way**), the world of the gods. According  to the myth, **a llama announced** a shepherd **a flood** in the constellation  of the Lama, which corresponds to our constellation of Orion, before  which he should bring with his flock on the mountain Vilcacoto, to  safety.

Maybe the visitor is trying to connect the milky way or space to earth by launching the rocket on june the 22. 

&gt;  
The  annual disappearance of the Pleiades from the southern, nocturnal  starry heavens and their reappearance after more than four weeks on June  8 was considered pachakuti because of its significant fluctuations, as  an **omen for an impending doomsday**, a deluge.

Is the map beeing flooded? Or he is destroying something with the rocket???

&gt;  
According  to the Andean myth, the **Flood** took place exactly at the time when the  Pleiades, the Andean constellation of the fox, were seen again in the  sky exactly four weeks before the winter solstice. According  to legend, **all animals flee** from the rising tide**, the fox, however**,  **slips off,** so that **his tail gets wet**, so his ~~cock~~  *(I think this should have been translated to tail*.) is still black today.

Fox? Hmmmm, isnt there a fox near wailing woods? So maybe the right side of the map is beeing destroyed or flooded????

&gt;  
Three  kilometers outside of Cuzco, in Kenko, two cylindrically shaped,  closely spaced stones rise about 20 centimeters, which served as  sightstones in the star observation, especially the Pleiades, of Alpha  and Alpha Centauri.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet.  
Omega is the 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet. Omega is often used to indicate an end, and thus is the opposite of the beginning, the alpha.

Maybe Carbide is ""Alpha"", beginning of season and ""Omega"" indicates the end of the season.

**TLDR**: Pls read the whole thing, thanks. 

Thanks for reading the whole thing. Here is a heart for you ♥

Will the map be destroyed or flooded? Will we get some incan temples over the map, like we got the chinese things? 

Maybe this has nothing to do with Fortnite i dunno. But so many coincidences are very unlikely, arent they?

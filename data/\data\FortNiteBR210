8,BorisGuzo,1537558134,9ht8ux,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ht8ux/building_fatigue/,0,Building fatigue,"I think this could be interesting, without nerfing building so much, but bringing it closer to the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever you build, if you have built in the last 10 seconds, it takes 10% longer for the piece to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, you build a wall, let's say it takes 5 seconds for it to complete. If you build another wall within 10 seconds, it takes 5.5 seconds to complete. The third piece, say a ramp, takes 6 seconds to complete. A fourth piece takes 6.5 seconds to complete. Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't build anything for 10 seconds, the completion time resets to base value.

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't affect the ability to build fast. If you build a lot in quick succession, your pieces takes more time to complete, making them more fragile.

&amp;#x200B;

Yay or nay?

1. Separate Building Sensitivity For Console

2. Pets, Kinda Like Toys This Season, U Use Them Like An Emote And Ur Per Comes Out! 

3. New Ways Of Transportation, We Have Rifts, Gold Carts, Etc.. But What About A Hot Air Balloon! I think it would be so cool to fly with ur squad in a hot air balloon with some type of fuel mechanism and the balloon would be able to be shot just like supply drops!

4. New cosmetic features, color customization, masks etc..

5. A more detailed story line, what I mean by this is I would like to play along in the story line kinda like S4 with the rocket and everything I feel was much more interactive than this season

6. More community based stuff, for example maybe skin competitions were players could enter their favorite skins and everyone votes and then that skin gets added, it would be a great way to interact with the community! And see some amazing art!!

7. Option for cross hair customization, I know this has been suggested multiple times but I feel for some people it would greatly improve and help their game!

If idea gains traction please give him some credit. Mine has been altered from his to reflect my thoughts for what a mode such as this could be.*

Glide into the heat of battle with three random teammates in this new, ever-changing limited time mode! This 2-phase mode will begin slowly with 25 teams of four, and eventually end in total chaos.

Tactically take control of the battle by recruiting enemy players to fight for your side! In this mode, players will initially only be knocked out when overtaken in battle. Teams will work to take control of enemy players by reviving them after they are knocked out in combat, while working to retain their own numbers.

Phase 1 will consist of teams ""recruiting"" enemy players to fight alongside them, working towards a total of 50 teammates on one team. But watch out, just as quickly as you recruit an enemy player to your team, they (or you) can be taken back or even stolen by another team! During this phase, there will be no storm.

Once 50 players are recruited to one team, Phase 2 will begin. The remaining players will be grouped into an opposing team and the storm circle will rapidly shrink to the center of the map (very much like the final storm in playground). Phase 2 will be an all-out warfare until one of the two teams is completely wiped out! During this phase, there will be no revives - kills are instant.

**Some potential rules/modifications to note:**
-	Reviving will speed up slightly with every additional person attempting the revive.
-	It will take slightly longer to revive a teammate than it will to revive (""recruit"") an enemy player.
-	As mentioned above, during the first phase, there will be no permanent death, you will simply be knocked and unable to move while down. During the second phase, once your health bar hits 0, you are dead.
-	If a match loses players or begins with less than 100 players, Phase 2 will begin when one half is ""recruited.""
-	Gliders will be enabled when jumping from structures.
-	As normally, friendly players will be shown on the minimap when they are downed. In addition, during the first phase, downed enemy players will show on the HUD in the direction that they are waiting to be revived, much like how jewels work in Getaway.
-	Once Phase 2 begins, all downed players that are not a part of the first team of 50 will instantly be revived and placed on the second team.

It's cool that you can unlock the full personalization abilities of Ragnarok in later seasons because a lot of people don't have time to play since school is starting, work, etc. 

However, I like to grind towards rewards in games and I'm sure a lot of other people do too. So the above doesn't give me much incentive to work towards a reward if it can be done later at a different time (also when the game runs my HDD at 100% doesn't give me much incentive too). 

Currently, unlocking full personalization for Ragnarok during season 5 gets you blue lights and if you unlock the personalization in later seasons you also get blue lights. Here is my proposal, when you unlock full customization for Ragnarok in season 5 you are able to get access to 3 more colours, and unlocking full customization for Ragnarok outside of season 5 results in only blue lights.",FortNiteBR

Don't get me wrong, im 22, so I dont need to be watching ""family friendly"" streamers but being able to watch someone who is both a skillfull and respctful player takes the cake in my books.

   This post is just an appreciation post, I hope that if you havent seen any of them play live, you soon will! I dont expect them to take time out of their busy schedules to respond to this, I hope it catches their eye and maybe makes their day though! :) 

   Ninja is well a damn Ninja to say the least....Split second timing and countless amount of hours played. He is overall in my opinion top 10 in the world in terms of knowlege and skill. Hes great and the fact he has an after hours stream is nice for his more mature audiances at night! 

   Nick seems like hes got the heart of a lion and the smile of a pure winner! :) I love the guy, watching him litterally brings a smile on my face BECAUSE of how much he is smiling lol, and he is for sure one of the best in the world in terms of editing, as far as being nice he gets the #1 spot! I am also from the East Coast (not NS like him, im from a different province) but I still considder him to be basically a local to me and for that he gets even more support from my end! 


   And last but certinly not least, Sphyer... The Trap king. I havent seen any other stream mess with/trap people as easily as this guy, seriously I dont understand it lol. I bet that his trap key binding is propably his favourite! Not to mention all of the educational commentary he's done on youtube has shown me many different kinds tips and tricks!



   These guys deserve a medal!! They have all taught me so much in terms of game knowlege and also how to present yourself as a streamer and for that I can't express enough thanks. You can only learn so much on your own before looking at other avenues and these guys have showed me the road and where it leads! I am by no means a pro player but because of them I have decided to move from my pS4 to a PC to get better and to also stream my progress as I continue to learn throughout this coming season (S6). Wish me luck on my journey , I plan on putting in hours everyday practing edits/building, and also finding the best keybinds that suit me and my personal preference, my goal will be to compete in Spring Skirmish.

* Pleasent Park
* Flush Factory
* Fatal Fields
* Salty Springs
* Retail Row 
* Lonely Lodge
* Wailing Woods

Not included are Loot Lake which is now a bounce pad, and non named locations like the RV park, and shipping containers north of Retail Row.

All my weekly challenges are fully completed and so are my drift stages so there‚Äôs virtually nothing I could do BUT buy tiers. 

That was until Fortnite released that there will be an EXTRA WEEK until season 6 comes out. I would not have spent $10 if I knew I had another week which I definitely could have completed tier 100.

I just think and I‚Äôm sure some of you can agree, that them releasing the ‚Äú10 battle star‚Äù packages when the days remaining are under 5 days then extending them again is a complete scam. 

It‚Äôs not like $10 is a HUGE deal but it definitely makes me have a new perspective on epic games and how they would manipulate their players who are already putting money in their pockets for a free game just for an extra dollar. I guess I‚Äôm just hugely disappointed. ",FortNiteBR

It can carry infinite ammo and your mobility while carrying it is unaffected. You can run, jump and the bloom is unbelievably small. It rips through every type of build and is almost impossible to counter without the perfect angle and a perfect aim to get a one shot kill. I have a solution that may be much better. 

The minigun should be removed and replaced with the ‚Äúmountable minigun‚Äù.  It‚Äôs essentially a minigun but it cannot be used unless mounted on a premade in-game building or the user‚Äôs own build. It can be taken off by breaking the wall its placed on and picked up. It has an overheat setting so once 50 bullets are shot, it overheats and has a 5 second cooldown, giving an opponent a chance to counter it.

This made me write to Epic games with the request if they could merge the two accounts, in terms of putting all the cosmetical items into one of them. 

So I wrote my e-mail, and the answer was automatically generated and sent back to me (see the image). For me personally, it is not about the progress I want to be transferred, but more about the cosmetic items. It is very irritating to constantly switch between accounts to play as different characters.

I hope that Epic Games sees this and understand that this situation is not ideal. 
But also I hope that it will be possible to commit said action for players in my situation or a similar one.

With kind regards,

a great fan of your game,

We know games can become addictive and also can ruin lifes if the person who plays it puts the game over everything that is important in his life. 

Me and my friend had the baccalaureate (It's like an SAT but in my country we call it that) this year and my friend just got into Fortnite at the middle of the school-year. He took it as a casual game,playing it for fun, and he ended being addicted to the point where he stopped coming to school to play Fortnite. One thing led to another and he failed the exam. Now we are in Uni and now he has to start working in a low-paying job, with very chances to pass the exam next year. Basically Fortnite destroyed his future,because if you don't have a degree or that exam taken, you can barely survive with the money earned. 

TL;DR(Including the question). My friend ruined his future by playing too much fortnite.Is anyone here that ruined his life playing this game for too much (or do you know anyone)? Are you/they sorry for what happened? I honestly don't know how can a casual game like Fortnite become so addictive. ",FortNiteBR

This game that we absorb into, and play religiously because of how hard epic works on improving, and nullifying any discrepancies with balancing, matchmaking, and glitches. We get weekly updates, that's right, WEEKLY! You don't get this kind of relevancy with many other big developers, if any at all, I most certainly don't play any other games that update every single week.

Rewind about 9 months ago, this sub-reddit was by far my favourite place to be, everyone appreciated the effort EPIC made, but now, every thread feels like I've just walked into a room of 6 year olds screaming for their deserts. 

I understand us as a community needs to be loud so Epic can continuously improve the game, but please for the love of God, just enjoy the fucking game, and stop actively looking for another reason to bloody moan!

The season finale is upon us and its gonna be huge.","Alright, so we all know season 6 is closing in. And stuff starts to go down in the days before the end. Here's my ultimate theory on what's going to happen.

So this season 6 buildup started the second the rocket cracked the sky. The sky rift was a dimensional portal to our planet, but it brought things into the Fortnite map. On August 24th (my birthday lol) Kevin was born from the lightning. The rift used the last of it's energy to pour everything it had into the creation of the cube. So technically, the rift turned into the cube, right? That's what I believe.

Then the cube started moving around the map. As it moved, it planted seven runes into the map. I'll get back to that. As it got to loot lake, it melted into it, dissolving, and spreading it's essence around the lake. 

I believe that if the rift was a portal to our world, and that rift became the cube, and the cube in turn became loot lake, I believe that Loot Lake is a portal to our, or some other dimension.

As for the main event, I believe that the runes rill shoot some sort of beam diagonally into the sky (hence their placement around the map so you can see the event at any point). These beams will all connect over the center of loot lake, and fire a huge beam down into the cube water. Whatever happens to loot lake will come out of whatever is created from that event. We may even see NPC players come out of it. But that's for another theory.

DL;TR: The rift is still existent in the Cube water of loot lake, and it's going to open a HUGE portal.

RIP Kevin. We will never forget.",FortNiteBR

Is not the grappler is the god dam 2x barrel that is absolutely broken, the game would be in a perfect state if this gun was vaulted or nerfed. If you don't got one and the enemy does and he has a grappler you are in so many problems. This gun is skill less and completely broken, I swear to god.

Playground V2 came with some really nice improvements however I think there‚Äôs some minor inconveniences that would be nice to have have more control over. 
Now before getting to the list.
 I do understand that some people solely use playground for training and improving their skills but in reality I bet that the wast majority is looking for a longer timed game session to hang around with their squads or alone to do funny testing and montages and builds. So in order to not conflict with the more serious audience it would be needed to have some toggle able options before going into a playground session. 

And now, let‚Äôs dive into the list..

- lower the height from where we are able to open our gliders when we are dropping from the battle bus ( use same mechanics as launch pad is using, dropping closer to the ground much faster). Lowering respawn time from 10 to 3 seconds was a great improvement but with the default gliding down it feels too slow;

- increase the amount of mats that can be held from 999 up to 5000 preferably (just like in save the world) or please at least double it up to 2k. Would make builders job much easier for some nice projects;

- increase the amount of stacked items which can be held (example: c4, boogie bombs, medkits, etc) it was a nice addition to increase the drop for some items but the problem still persists halfway right now because we are only able to pick up a small portion of it;

 Conclusion: Playground is playground, even the name says it, make it fun, make it flexible and customizable so everyone can create and enjoy their time the way they want to. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing on a lot of changes right now, but feel free to add your own suggestion for playground in the comments. 

Let‚Äôs make this get some attention around the start of the new season, hopefully we will see some nice changes in v3 of Playground once it drops. 

Peace üôÇ

 Odd how many people swore all season they knew Epic would and anyone who didnt have faith a big event would happen this season was a troll.

Win 25 matches: unlocks the Cloth Victory Cape; a brown newly made cape with a fresh #1 on the back

Win 100 matches: unlocks the Premium Leather Victory Cape; a dark black/brown cape made of quality leather with an embroidered #1 on the back

Win 250 matches: unlocks Silver Silk Victory Cape; a soft flowing silver cape with a gold #1 on the back of it

Win 500 matches: unlocks the Gold Silk Victory Cape; a light shimmery gold cape with a silver metallic #1 on the back of it

But it's not hard to see that it's OP. 15 shots? Really? Compared to impulse grenades which you get 3 of, and which are harder to properly aim, and less versatile (can't go straight up on a whim, save yourself from falls, etc.). If they want to keep current grapple mechanics, the ammo count has to be 5-6 to keep it in line with other mobility items. End of story.

If 15 shots is what they want, they need to nerf the speed at which you move. It's insane how much ground or air you can cover and how fast. They should add a delay where once you hook something, you're frozen in place (midair or on the ground) for ~0.4 seconds before pulling yourself to it. This would give attentive players time to do some damage to people grappling. At the moment the items has zero downsides. You can scale an entire mountain or tower instantly and with very little counters. It's honestly worse than the jetpack in the hands of a good player.

It is such a fun, well designed item. But it's currently overtuned and undermines some core game mechanics.",FortNiteBR

Considering the Tomato Head challenges were added to a retro-active skin, it looks like they have the necessary mechanics/APIs to implement something like this.

I am too lazy and stupid to create an online petition, but if someone with more motivation and intelligence is willing to cook one up, I will definitely sign up to that &gt;!thing!&lt; , but for whatever reason, I have a hunch that Epic is going to shrug it off as ""too much work"", especially since it won't necessarily bring any *new* revenues. 

With that being said, I am not going to lie and say that I am holding my wallet hostage until this is implemented by refusing to buy V-bucks, but I am certainly losing some motivation to play (just got Overwatch... it's tight).

I know this much to be true as the llama bell was not in the load out and he likes to use that when we are in the lobby.    

Anyways he went into the item shop and noticed there was an owned market next to the blond soccer guy skin.  I know for a fact he wouldnt buy this because he doesn't like soccer, doesn't like the blond guy, was saving the vbucks for next season pass, and most importantly did not log in yesterday.    

I checked his past successful xbox log ins and the last was Monday which is correct.  He doesn't play on PC at all either.  

He has used his 3 refunds already so I was curious if there's a way to look at when this skin was purchased.  How helpful do you think epic support will be?  I've already emailed them btw.

I can't win any 1v1 battles. I can't aim and jump at the same time. My ""kill 4 enemies with a shotgun"" task sits unfulfilled, staring at me every time I log in. I can't tell where the fight is happening from the sounds alone. But I still love playing the game. So, I mostly play 50v50 so that I get to play and not die at the first sight of an enemy every game. Or die before I even see anyone else because they see me first and kill me before I even know where they are. 

50v50 is a great mode for unskilled players like myself who want to enjoy the game and feel like we contribute to a team win. I enjoy the low pressure gathering guns and mats, then running into a huge battle. I enjoy sitting in a team built fortress and shooting foes from far away, occasionally seeing a blue 20 pop up, while providing cover for my more skilled teammates who rush the enemy. 

But since Soaring 50's has taken over, the mode has become more and more frustrating and less enjoyable. Soaring lets groups rush in too easily. The battle is typically over before I get to the circle. As soon as one side groups, they can rush through enemy territory, picking off enemies one at a time as an enormous squad of 10 or 20 or 30. 

It's too easy. 

The fights are faster. I can't sit on the outside and spray with my AR because moments after I open fire, 3-5 enemies are flying directly to my position to shotgun my face off. 

The wins are less satisfying. I spend most of my time trying to keep up with the group. Sometimes the match is over in 6 minutes and I never even spotted a single enemy despite spending 3 out of those minutes in the safety zone. 

Soaring 50's turns into a massive shotgun battle every time, with the winner quickly decided by a single rocket launch from one side or the other and then a steamroll through the remaining enemies. 

It's not fun. It makes me not want to play Fortnite anymore. I hope they bring the standard mode back soon. ",FortNiteBR

I have a theory surrounding the Bus Driver that is highly plausible. Here it is:

*Every season, the Bus that the Bus Driver drives is getting bigger.*

‚ÄúANOTHER DAY ANOTHER USELESS POST HERE ON FORTNITEBR!!1‚Äù

Whoa, hold up passive aggressive Chad Mc‚ÄôChadderson, hear me out. 

I believe that the bus has been getting bigger, season by season. Every time the bus ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù off the map after all players within the server have left the bus, it‚Äôs not actually disappearing. The Bus Driver is driving the bus through a Voltron Portal that leads to a shapeshifting inter-dimension within a dimension that charges the bus‚Äô interior, exterior and the bus driver himself. What this does is increases the size of the bus and increases the muscle mass of the Bus Driver. 

As each season passes, the Bus Driver and the bus become more aggressive. The Bus Driver will slowly begin to drive more erratically due to fits of rage. Occasionally, the bus will also take control of its own spirit and intentionally drive off course in an attempt to establish its own consciousness. 

Once we reach Season 9-10 (I can‚Äôt confirm which season this will all happen in as of yet. I‚Äôm still researching this), the Bus will begin to speak it‚Äôs own automotive language, one that us as players will not be able to understand. The Bus Driver will have merged *into* the Bus at this point, effectively making Bus and Driver as one.

*‚ÄùOkay, you‚Äôre starting to make sense now. But what is this all leading to exactly?‚Äù*

I believe that all 100M+ concurrent players will be forced into a single server by Epic Games to fight against the bus on a Bus map. The entire map will consist of the bus and the bus alone. The Bus Driver (who has merged INTO the Bus at this point remember) will attack you with his hands that stick out of the sides of the Bus. We as players will have to defeat the Bus and send it back through the Voltron Portal, through each inter-dimensional shapeshifting zone until the bus (who has been defeated by all 100M+ players at this point) reaches the Garzolyion dimension, a dimension that acts with the same premise as a purgatorial based galaxy. 

This is just a theory of mine. Whilst none of the above is confirmed, I believe it‚Äôs likely that we‚Äôll see this happen in the future. ",FortNiteBR

The hospital would be a 3 story building that would be made out of brick.  


1st Floor: Waiting room right inside the overhang. To the right would be a cafe. To the left would be a elevator(broken), some stairs, and a exam room. (Up to 3 chests)  


2nd Floor: Multiple recovery rooms, nothing special. (Up to 4 chests)  


3rd Floor: (I don't know) I want you guys to help me decide what goes on this floor.  


Roof: 1 chest spawn, with some garbage.

  
Outside: Multiple cars and bushes. Some trees. (Up to 2 chests)  


Some Ariel pictures. [https://imgur.com/a/wGIorJy](https://imgur.com/a/wGIorJy)  


**REASON WHY:** With very little loot in the area, and the area being apretty popular, this would be a great area for loot and materials.  


Any suggestions? (Sorry for it being a bad concept, just wanted to something like this.)",FortNiteBR

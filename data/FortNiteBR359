This is when the Meteor begins breaking apart small pieces of it, creating a meteor shower.

I am concluding that today is the day we realize Epic is in fact utilizing the once know comet and will use it as a transition from season to season.

As everyone knows by now, the Morse code was SOSD5418. 4/18 could mean today but could also mean April 2018. Which is the final month of the Season. April 30th is THE final day before May 1 starting off Season 4. I believe this meteor will impact the map just before the start of season 4 while either demolishing only Tilted, or presenting an entire new map for us to play that is full of ruins, Fire, craters, and more.

After playing duos with my son, and letting him down in a big way, I know I need to change my ways.","I am an old man. I've been playing video games since video games began. I've never been good at shooters, especially multiplayer shooters, but there have been a few that have caught my interest along the way.

When Minecraft was the next big thing, I spent a lot of time on the game. However, my son, when he played Minecraft, he discovered the Hunger Game servers, the first time I saw Battle Royal genre in play, and he played the hell out of it. I enjoyed watching, but I never gave it a go.

Then PUBG became popular, and the Battle Royal concept grew on me, so I purchased a copy for my son and I, but it wouldn't run on our computers. C'est la vie.

And then my brother introduced me to Fortnite.

And we had so much fun hiding on the edge of the bubble all game, every game, just chatting about whatever while we camp and wait until we need to move again. And a bush camper was born. And when I tried to convince people to try Fortnite, I would even say, ""It's fun to just hide and chat all game!""

Now, it should be said, everybody gets to enjoy their game however they choose to do it. Fortnite is like the most organic version of the ""choose your own way to play"" videogame trope. Few games give you a *genuine* choice between stealth and guns blazing, but a lot of games tout it. And it must be recognized: bush campers get rewarded for being bush campers. The chance of securing a win is heightened by a vast margin when you make it to the top 5 almost every game, especially as someone who plays like a potato. Sure, we don't much care for bush campers here on /r/FortNiteBR, but it must be recognized: people do it because it works. People do it because they get a positive feedback loop from doing it. I know I did.

Until I started playing with my son.

He's played a lot more than me, and he's a lot better than me. *However* I have twice as many wins as he does, and I always sort of rested on those laurels and figured, sure, I can't shoot and build like he can, but I play to win. Pretty stupid of me, I know. And it hit me where it counts the other day, when my son and I were playing duos, and I failed to clutch the win for us.

It was down to the final 4, in Lucky Landing, and we had a small tower on the high ground. My son had probably close to 10 kills, and I maybe had a couple, but maybe not. I had read in this sub that the rocket launcher is essentially the best shotgun in the game, so I had dropped my blue tac in favor of a second legendary launcher earlier. So I'm raining rockets while my son is sniping at our opponents, who seem to be basically just building on the ground below the hill we are on to stay alive from our pressure. We were in good shape.

Then my son gets domed and goes down. I have enough time to rez him, but our opponents are taking the opportunity to rush us. A Raven jumps into our tower, shotguns my son back down, and I leap out of the tower throwing a rocket back as I go, downing the Raven.

So it's just me and a Rust Lord playing peekaboo at the base of our tower. He with a shotgun, me with a rocket launcher. My jumps have diminished into flails because I've been jumping too much. My launcher takes an hour to reload after every shot. The Rust Lord kills me, and both my son and I have the pleasure of seeing, as we spectate him, that he killed me with 4 health remaining.

Now, I know that you can't win every game. I know that our defeat meant someone else got to jump up and down and scream out loud in victory. I know these are the breaks that come with multiplayer gaming.

But I can't help reliving that last fight over and over.

There where a lot of things I could have done to improve my odds of clutching that last 1v1. I could have kept my shotgun instead of opting for two launchers. I could have switched to my scar instead of constantly reloading the launcher. I could have built during my fall out of the tower and maintained the high ground. I could have built after I landed and reclaimed the high ground. Heck, even before that fight, maybe that fight never would have happened if I'd just switched between launcher and scar to keep pressure on them instead of shooting two rockets at a time, reloading, and repeating.

But, more than anything, what I've realized is, I have to git gud. And, ironically, in order to git gud, I have to stop winning. I have to stop bush camping. I have to learn to ""just build lol."" I have to experiment with a diverse array of load outs to figure out for myself what works and what doesn't. I have to land at Pleasant Park and not the nameless edges of the island.

I have to take the L if I ever want to learn how to genuinely earn the W.

Why did I write all this? I dunno. Mostly for myself. Mostly just to crystallize my thoughts and try to learn what I'm doing wrong and what I need to do next. Of course, I would love any advice I could get from the community, but I'm not sure anybody could offer any theory that would be better than just practicing. I'm such a clumsy, slow builder... I did change my build keys from F1-F4 to ZXCV, so my fingers are closer, but I'm still slow as hell - like, it feels like a MASSIVE victory if I ever beat someone in a building fight. I wish there was a way to grind building fights - and even as I write that, I know there is a way to grind them: in regular games.

If I had anything to add, because, ya know, I haven't written enough: The community is so vitriolic towards bush campers, it gives bush campers very little actual reason to change their ways. The game literally rewards you for camping, and if you have a little bit of empathy for the bush camper, and *why* they are bush camping, you might help them avoid the trap that bush camping tends to be. It *is* a technically valid strategy. It *doesn't* help you get better.

And for all my fellow bush campers out there, good luck, be safe, I hope you get your wins. I'll be that guy you let run by, running and jumping out in the open, searching for my next engagement. Maybe take a pot shot - at least, if it's me, you'll probably get the kill.

**tldr** - Old man has identity crisis because he chose to be a bush camper, and now he is a burden to his family. Like *Sophie's Choice*, but Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

I had downloaded the game the day it came out and played hours after hours with my friends having a great time. I was playing the game mostly so I could get my Battle Royale fix before PUBG came out on the Xbox. And when PUBG did come out I played FortNite a lot less. And after the next couple of updates for FortNite I stopped playing all together. The game changed. In my opinion, for the worse. Only recently I started to play again with friends and it’s still easy. That’s my biggest issue. It’s not a challenge. I’m not a god at the game by any stretch but I find it all to easy to hop on the game and make it to the late game. Also, the emotes. Jesus Christ every single time I go into a game it’s a plague of stupid and downright cringey dance moves. On top of those two things, the fanbase. I know that it’s not all little kids that play the game. But after my 3 or 4  month hiatus from the game I jumped on squads with randoms and went into game chat. One guy didn’t have a mic, the other was a timid and quiet kid, and the other was some squeaker who died at the start and screamed at us saying how bad we were. What a warm welcome back. What I’m trying to say is that the game would be twenty times better than it is right now if they would have left it the way they had it at launched and patched the bugs. Until that happens, (which it probably won’t) I’m going to stick with Siege and PUBG.",FortNiteBR

The Guided Missile was an addition which in my opinion brought quite a lot of diversity into Fortnite, and not to mention that it was pretty nicely designed, with all the steering, the camera stuff and so on \- just felt like something really new and unique. 

With all new stuff,there is always talking about how ""OP"" is something. I bet you all remember when the Minigun was brought in the game. 999 ammo,shooting at you for minutes, destroying everything you build and you just felt helpless and powerless to do anything. Couple of days passed and the biggest counter to a Minigun was not building yourself in, but literally standing in one spot, withdrawing your sniper and blasting the other guys' head off. Minigun died in like a week or two and now it's not so useful \(at least for duos and solos\). The reason I am bringing up this example, is because I believe that everything has it's counter and the launcher sure did have, like every other explosive weapon \- walls. Yes, the process seems a bit harder, as from time to time you had to box yourself in,which made pushing a bit harder, but not impossible. Another way of protecting yourself from these missiles was literally 4 shots from an AR \(the hitbox of the rocket was INSANELY big, and with the first shot accuracy that would have been EVEN EASIER\). Given these two examples I believe that every average player could protect themselves from such a weapon. To add to this, you could freaking rocket ride yourself across the map and that was dope \(probably the thing i'll miss the most\).

The above was just my opinion on why I believe it was a balanced weapon and an overall good addition. My true concern is that nobody asked me, or the other millions of users \(who probably don't even know it has been vaulted yet\) about MY personal thoughts regarding this particular change. Reddit is not a good source of information for devs, regarding the state of a game. I can assure you that probably less than 5&amp;#37; disliked this weapon, started shitposting and Epic thought ""Hey, maybe this is an overpowered weapon that f\*cks up the game"" \- but what about the other 95&amp;#37;,including me? Is it so hard to make an in\-game poll that would last for a week? Isn't this a better way of actually getting to know what your playerbase likes and what not?A Yes/No/IDGAF option poll that could have given you better insight about what you should do next, be it nerfing, steering speed slow down, damage reduction, or whatever. It really sucks seeing something that was going to bring action of epic proportions going away, only because some people are legit bad at the game.

tl;dr RIP guided missile launcher you'll be missed / pls polls if we dislike something about the game, so we don't unnecessarily remove stuff that's actually fun ",FortNiteBR

I should be able to kill you with just as good as a chance with a AR as i can with a shotgun at close range. 

I use to be able to run into houses where enemies were with my AR and take them out even when they had a shotgun. Now i cant do that anymore.

This is just a noob game where everyone jumps around like a bunny with there shotgun. If you miss one shot you might as well just let the other guy kill you. 

This game use to be sooo fun i could play for 8 hours like its nothing. Now i just play a game or two, maybe three and log off. 

If this game wasn’t free no one would be playing this crap

Before update 3.4 everything was perfect, i could kill people with shotguns with my AR at close range like it was nothing. 

Ever since that guy Ninja complained on youtube saying how he hated how ppl could kill you with a AR at close range and that shot guns should be the only weapon to kill at close range ,  fornite changed the gun mechanics and broke the game.

I recently got two of my friends into Fortnite. They play on Xbox and I play on PC. I always land us in Moisty or any other corner of the map in order for me to teach them the basics. Sometimes the circle is too far that I dont get to teach them because we have to start running.

A practice mode would be amazing for this! It doesnt even have to render the whole map, just give me spawn island with unlimited resources (i.e a tree that you can hit for resources but it has an infinite health bar) and every weapon with unlimited ammo. This way I can teach them how to build and how to edit. I can teach them how to order their weapons in their inventory so they can switch between them easily mid fight. They can also get used to the sniper bullet drop and so on! 


A practice mode would also benefit me because I want to better my building skills. I am getting pretty good but I still need practice, especially with editing. 

A practice mode would also keep the new players out of a normal match and give that spot to another player who's ready to actually play the game and not waste his time trying to learn the game in Moisty.

For anyone concerned about how a practice mode will affect the game just look at League of Legends. It took them YEARS to release a practice mode because they were scared it would take away players from the actual game and guess what? It didnt lol.

EPIC give us practice mode please so I can be as good as Ninja lul

EDIT: Read the comments and it still baffles me that people are against this. Let me tell you something. I've personally seen people play Fortnite and after a few rounds they stop and give up because they cannot kill anything. Because they run into John Wick who builds a fort over them and executes them long d*ck style. There is no tutorial mode to teach them how to build (Im talking BR only) and really there is no guidance from within the game to teach them how to play. So instead, out of the 100 people you have only 97 really participating (and who knows how many other are learning as well) because me and da bois are at Moisty learning to play. I know some of you Rambos love picking on no skins and it strikes fear into your hearts that we give them a tool to become better because they might actually KILL YOU. Do you know how many times I build on a no skin and they sit there and do nothing? Yes I got a kill, yes it feels great, but only to me! Theyre probably thinking WTF?

I grew up on video games and shooters so it wasent hard for me to pick up the game but for others who didnt grow up on shooters it can be pretty difficult. It feels bad to get killed and get L emoted by a Rust Lord when youre just trying to learn the game. A practice mode would LITERALLY NOT AFFECT YOU IN ANY WAY except maybe itll make the game harder for you since players will have a tool to get better ;)",FortNiteBR

Right now our prizes for winning a match are umbrellas and statistics. We need more than that. We don't need rewards mid-match for feats like others are asking, but those feats can bring a new reward at the end of a match. Just like working a job to eventually be rewarded with raises or promotions, players like to feel rewarded for accomplishments. 

Epic, this would lead to higher profits for you. Rewarding wins would keep players playing and trying to win, and as I'm sure you are aware, retention is important in any industry.

**note not all of these have to happen this is just a list of ideas to show possibilities**

There can be rewards for accumulated wins for each mode:  
Win 1 game Solo/Duo/Squads.  
Win 5 games Solo/Duo/Squads.  
Win 10 games Solo/Duo/Squads.  
Win 20 games Solo/Duo/Squads.  
Win 50 games Solo/Duo/Squads.  

There can be killstreak rewards:   
Win with 1 kill.   
Win with 4 or less kills.  
Win with 5 kills.   
Win with 10 kills.  
Win with 20 kills.   
Win with 30+ kills.   

There can be accomplishment rewards:  
Win after having built XX structures.  
Win with building 10 or less structures.  
Win with an explosive kill as the last kill.  
Win with a sniper kill as the last kill.  
Win with a pickaxe kill as the last kill (ULTRA HARD)  

Possibilities are pretty endless and would make winning much more meaningful. Each reward would be specific to the achievement so others can see you pulled it off, or could be a ""win token"" as suggested by u/m4r1one3tte to eventually purchase other items.

So I’ve been lurking around in this subreddit for some months now, and I love the content, especially the memes. One meme that I truly love is the John Wick meme. The way he kills and builds so aggressively is just magnificent. However, I never fully got see a John Wick in action until today.

Earlier today, I was home alone and playing some Fortnite BR on my Xbox. I usually play solo, as my friends play on PS4, but after getting killed all the time \(I’m really bad lol\), I decided to play Duos, hoping for a win.

When me and my random partner landed, I got a closer look at him and saw that he was a John Wick. I got really exited, and was thinking about all the memes on the subreddit. “I’m getting a fucking W today” I was thinking. We were communicating using the emote\-thing, and we shared everything we found.

The game started of slow, as we didn’t see many enemies, but shit got pretty wild when it was around 30 players left. Every time we met some enemies, this dude killed them in a second. I’ve never seen someone build and kill so fast. I didn’t even get to see the enemies lol. When the game slowed down, we focused on looting.

After opening some supply drops etc., I checked how many players left: 8, and this is where I’m starting to sweat. I had 0 kills while this dude had freaking 12\(!!!\). I really needed at least one kill, to prove to my partner that I wasn’t that bad.

He killed 5 more players, leaving one player left. Suddenly, he turns on his mic, saying “this is your chance bro, kill that motherfucker”. And Oh boy did I get hyped. While fighting the last guy, I noticed that Mr. Wick was spectating me from a 1x1 base, and just watched the rest of the game. He didn’t even move, he was just standing there. Smiling, like a little child.

This is where I got really nervous, but after a few minutes of fighting, I dropped that bitch down. When I saw the ‘Victory Royale’ screen I got so happy, you don’t even know.  This is the best match I’ve ever played, and I will never forget this player.

Thank you for reading this shitty story lol.

Btw, if anyone wants to play on xbox, let me know :\)",FortNiteBR
108,getnerdedx,1524066152,8d6lrn,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8d6lrn/epic_please_make_kills_more_rewarding/,0,"Epic, please make Kills more rewarding!","Currently wins are the most rewarded metric in Fortnite. IMO, kills need to be rewarded much more than they currently are. Kills should help you have an improved odds to win, not be an obstacle to winning. The best way to win right now is to avoid PvP combat until it is absolutely necessary - I don't think that is good for the game. My reasons and possible solutions are as follows:

Reasons kills are not rewarding:

1. Players rarely drop healing, but often damage you before they die.
2. +1 to Kill count is nice, but it does not improve your odds at winning the match.
3. Engaging in PvP combat is risky, but offers little to no reward*. Risk without meaningful reward is terrible game design.

*It is very easy to gather sufficient materials, ammo, and weapons, without having to kill other players. Therefore, the loot they drop isn't much of a reward - you could have gotten it anyways through just looting the map.

IMO, a 10+ kill player should have a massive advantage over a 1-2 kill player in the final 1v1 of a match. The reason for this, is the high kill player took many more risks during the game - that should count for something. Here are a few possible solutions:

1. Make players drop a static amount of healing items on death in addition to their normal loot. Also increase the stack sizes of all healing items.
2. Create a special drop table - tier it from 1-5 kills, 5-10 kills, and 10+ kills. This drop table contains powerful items that can only be obtained by killing other players. Players have a chance to drop items from the special drop table on death, depending on the number of kills had by the player who killed them. Each tier (1-5, 5-10, 10+) represents an increase in power level of the items contained in the drop table. These drops would occur as an addition to the player's normal loot.


One last thing: yes I understand that it's still plenty possible to win right now.  I have plenty of wins myself and my record is 19 kills in solos - but that's not the point.  It doesn't mean the current system can't be improved.

**SKYDIVING TRAILS: BUBBLES**
this is what you get from level 68 of the battlepass. where do you find bubbles? in the sea.

**BANNER ICON OF A WHALE**
this is what you get from level 82 of the battlepass. where do you find whales? THAT'S RIGHT! IN THE SEA!

now, we all thought that 4/18 is a date, as referred to 18th of April. and that is correct, but just not in 2018. 

if you go to wiki and search for 18th of April, you can find that many things happened. but we are looking at something specific. in 1518 - Bona Sforza is crowned as queen consort of Poland.
what is so special about that?
well, if you look here:
https://i.imgur.com/4VbOBtl.jpg


you can see that fortnite map and poland map are really similar. now let's go back to Bona Sforza.

this is how she looks:

https://imgur.com/a/LCn2h

exactly. she looks like a fish.

**tilted is going to be overruled by a fish lord CONFIRMED**


EDIT: this isn't all. if we check out 1518 (which is the year of Bona Sforza being crowned) we can see that at that same year. a plague occured which was called ""The Dancing Plague""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518

what's so special about a dancing plague? well first of all, there are many dances in fortnite. but more specifically,  if you look at the wiki page, you can see that the plague began by a person named Mrs. Troffea.
Troffea? or is it Trophy? it means we are going to have the winner of the boogiedown contest AT THE SAME DAY of when tilted is overruled by the goddess fish of poland. but when is it going to happen?

well.. the whale is at level 82 of the battlepass, and the bubbles at level 68.
82-68 = 14.
the dancing fever occurred in July, which is the 7th month.
14+7 is 21. 
21st of April is when we will have a new update.

Now so you don't have to scroll all the way down to see them here they are firstly.


125 polling, 1750 dpi, 0.3 hip, 0.81 ADS and 0.96 scoped.


So the tricky thing was finding a smooth setting the will tick all the boxes, i.e. Cursor smoothness (to rearrange items), hip fire flick and tracking accuracy &amp; assault tracking.

After playing around with different polling rates i realised the higher the polling rate, the less vertical moise movement you got. Why? No idea, but its true.

I played on 250 for the longest time and found that having an out of sync vertical and horizontal movement will also greatly affect the diagonal movement. Making it fairly useless.

Now the lower polling of 125 balances out both horizontal and vert allowing for much smoother diagonal aiming and a more consistent mouse im general.

The tracking is also pretty smooth (although still not PC quality) there's only so close as you can get, but still feels lush.


Try it these settings for a few games to develop some muscle memory, make sure your mouse has on board memory (this is 100% essential) and let me know how you like it.

Just to clarify, i am a wristy player and these settings may not feel right if you are an arm player.


Have a good one guys!

I have two points I’d like to discuss in further detail. 

1. 5 item inventory 

In a game built around having 5 slots available in your inventory it is very essential to choose your weapons and items carefully. You have your close range weapons, medium range weapons, long range weapons, explosives, shields, and healing. One of the common item setups I find myself carrying is a rocker launcher, an assault rifle, a shotgun, extra shield, and extra healing. This is especially prevalent in squad games when I want to keep healing for my squad. Under the current patch if I’m using a pump that means 2 of my 3 weapons have a delay. This does not feel fun when you get into a sudden fight and your only choice is the assault rifle or switch to you shotgun and stare into your attackers eyes while they kill you. A game focused around 5 item slots should not make half of the weapons in the game obsolete because you simply cannot justify carrying them in many situations. I know after reading this some of you are dying to say...

2. “Just use the tac shotgun”
   
I hate this argument because that’s just admitting that the pump has been made obsolete. I hate hitting 7 damage headshots with the tac every shot. I choose the pump because I am accurate with it and the risk versus reward used to feel fair. The pump now feels sluggish and out of place in this games fast paced style. Some people might say just build up and wait for the pump to be ready to fire but if i am using the pump I’m usually not in a situation where I have time to be waiting for my gun to equip. Plus the delay after building exists so they are also punishing you for building while having guns like this equipped. 

These points are related to things I’ve seen talked about but I just wanted to add my own take. This update slows down gameplay and makes a lot of the guns in the game just not feel fun or fair. ",FortNiteBR

I've been thinking about this for a while, but i always thought it would end up not making any sense. But, i took some time to check if it makes sense and honestly, it kind of does, even though there is one pretty big problem with it.

At the end of the code ""SOSD5418"", the numbers 418 are believed to correspond with a date. It is currently 18th of April and nothing has happened yet. I thought that 418 was maybe just another code. I checked it with a couple of number-patterns and this is what i found. When you double every number you get, starting at 1 (1-2-4-8-16 etc.), all three numbers are in it. 4 is the 3rd number, 1 is the 1st, and 8 is the 4th, and therefore the code might be ""314"". What I thought was that this could indicate the 31st of April, which happens to be the exact day season 3 ends. 

The problem is that there is no 31st of April. April ends on the 30th.

The last 3 years I've been gaining weight like hell, 30kgs (67lbs) to be exact and I thought it was time to do something about it. So this is what I am doing!

What is from fat to fit with Fortnite?

It's a challenge I will be taking on for the next coming months (starting 10:th of April 2018) where I will be exercising while playing Fortnite.

I will start off slow and soft with 3 push ups/sit ups every loss that I will accumulate up towards 6/9 or more before I do them. As the weeks go on I will start putting out more and more push ups depending on my body haha. I noticed the first week, doing only push ups destroyed my body, my shoulders, arm and chest hurts like hell so I am not doing sit ups also.

Outside of the camera I will also be eating better, I have quit sugar and I will be on a low calorie diet for as long as I can.

Do you have any tips or tricks on how to make this challenge even better? Feel free to come in to my chat and talk me up :D!

April 10, 2018 - 115.4kg (254lbs)
April 17, 2018 - 113.5kg (249lbs)
April 24, 2018 - ?
May 1, 2018 - ?
May 8, 2018 - ?

You will find me at www.twitch.com/prixm

From next week I will also be doing viewer games, so that will mean even more losses and even more push ups, haha!

I cannot shoot into people's builds as effectively and it halts the gameplay to a crawl. If you are going to allow multiple platforms to play with eachother, then you need to accept that some players are gonna be at a disadvantage when playing on controller. The answer shouldn't be to reduce the playability for the faster players, but to better streamline weapon switching for those playing on other platforms. 

I play this game because it is the best, most fast-paced battle royale on the market, and taking away features that are so integral to the gameplay you are changing the competitive fairness to favor those with less overall interest in your game.

I got really good with combat pro but I feel like if I get used to builder pro it’ll be better in the long run. The only problems I’ve had so far aside from not being used to it is there seems to be a delay sometimes. For example if I get shot and I want to build quickly I’ll spam R2 for walls but it would take a few seconds to register and actually start building walls. Also sometimes when I double tap it doesn’t build so I’d actually have to press a single button 3 times for it to build a piece. Also another issue is that it’s bad at building at weird angles. If you’re trying to do side by side ramps (2 ramps) it’ll often just not go off compared to me spamming r2 on combat pro and it’s working. Another problem is very situation specific. You ever have those times you put a floor down and literally 60-70% of it is covered by the ground, but you still try to put a trap or campfire? It doesn’t work. On combat pro, I can’t just spam r2 with the campfire for it to eventually be placed on the floor that’s mostly covered by grass. On builder pro however, when I press square to place the campfire, it just changes it to a trap or whatever else I have in my inventory. I think it’s thinking I have the wrong one out and I’m trying to put a trap but if that were the case I’d use the switch materials button. This is very situation specific so it’s not a big deal but a lot of small things are noticeable. Overall I’m already starting to build faster just not as well because I still have to think about what button is what. I like it but if it wasn’t super good on paper I would stick with combat pro. Also a small opinion is I think ramps are better on r1 instead of L2 (rb instead of lb on Xbox).",FortNiteBR

Personally I don't speculate too much about the theory as epic has been transparent with updates to keep communication and feedback prevalent in the community and would let us know something. On the other hand, this would make sense as they would implement season four with a map change instead of pushing for a map change 2 weeks before the end of season 3 which seems slightly unorganised to me, it just wouldn't feel right...

As soon as a new place gets added people are rushing to see what it is, how good the loot is, how ofter there are chests, and how often people go there. This is technically a new place, and will bring a lot more people into destroyed tilted towers. Short term it would make popularity worse, but long term will do it good, so more people will go Fatal, Salty, Retail, Pleasant, Greasy and other good places that aren't as visited as they were before tilted was added",FortNiteBR

However,

I need a new map.

I am utterly sick to death of this map and every place in it. No, removing Tilted won't suffice. An *entire map* as uniformly enticing as Tilted is what is needed.

The current map of FNBR is easily the worst part about the game, from a broad view. It remains a rushed afterthought no matter how many random PoIs they tack onto it. It's not cohesive at all; it consists of unrelated setpieces divided by lorem ipsum hills. It is colored like a splotchy eyesore. They could do better. They should do better.

I hope future seasons bring similar content so I can unlock all challenges at a relatively easy pace, yet feel accomplished at the same time.  These days I’m lucky to log 1-2 hours a day, yet most times I can walk away knowing I’m one or more tiers closer to the finish line!

I propose we eliminate the river entirely and replace it with a massive chasm where players can fall to their death.  

The only way to cross it would be to...

1.  Use one of the pre built bridges.

2.  Build across.

3.  Find a narrow point and Impulse across.

4.  Rocket ride across.

5.  Jump Pad across.

6.  In a few weeks, Jetpack across.

I think it would make traversing the map much more interesting and fun.  It would give the river area some much needed flavor in my opinion and make the map better overall.

I wanted to be good at this game, tried playing it a lot, first few matches were too disappointing since the whole mechanic of building was new, but I'll be glad to say I can build a bit better now, if someone takes a shot at me, I can quickly turn around and build a wall and some stairs to peek and shoot. This is a biiiig improvement if you look from where I started. The wall and stairs help me get a few shots off on the player but he almost always manages to finish me off, I can counter build too, but not to the extent of competitive players, (if they're building to get above me, I'll lay down floors over my head so I won't get headshotted but that's pretty much it). I reach top 15 easily but most of the time it's with zero kills. I make it a point to drop into the more populated areas too (Dusty, Tilted, Loot Lake and so on) but almost always I end up getting killed before I get a gun. If I manage to survive that, that's all the kills I'll ever get. I farm up resources too, trees, furniture, cars, trailers and what not.

I really want to improve. You can already tell I've played a shit-ton of matches as I'm level 20 and barely clocked 6 kills. Any sort of help will be appreciated.

Before you think that I hate this game, NO! I love playing this game even on the lowest specs. Great game, Epic!

So, I do know that alot of the people out there have actually okay PCs, but we need some respect for low end gamers. Fortnite runs very well on iOS, with great graphics (well good for me) and nice solid framerates. 

Then, I hop on to my budget laptop. (For those intrested, it's got an A12-7800, 8GB DDR4, 1TB HDD, 1080p screen.) The laptop is pretty solid for everyday tasks.

I load up Fortnite. Oof. Another large update (v3.5.) I wait 20 minutes... Done! Game runs and I can't wait to play. Then I play some duos, and this is where I start to see the difference. I turn my settings down to 360p internal resolution and bring all the rest of the settings down. How much FPS do I get? 40-50, 30 in intense situations. 

This is a shame. (Sorry Epic.) 

My friend's phone (iPhone SE) runs Fortnite so well, and my $400 laptop with much better specs than any other phone out there can't run this game? What? 

So in the end I am asking for better optimization on low end PCs. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but if there was better performance and optimization it would make my day!

Sorry Epic if that was a little offensive, and thank you for reading. If there is anything I missed out on how phones are different please tell me. 

And for the Redditors out there, feel free to tell me things I don't know. 

Thanks.


EDIT: A way I can play on better graphics is loading an Android emulator and downloading Fortnite when it comes out on Android.",FortNiteBR

Maybe I just need to ""git gud,"" but I feel it wouldn't hurt to have two rows of inventory, one for items that do damage, and one for heals.  

Whichever directional pad button isnt in use at the moment could be used to switch to your shields, medkits, or bandages so you don't accidentally switch to those in the middle of an intense building/gun battle.  

I know this might have been suggested before and I have gotten better at preventing the accidental, panic switch to my bandages, but I don't see how it could hurt the game in any way.

I guess it could lower skill gap on console a bit, but wouldn't affect PC at all.

Just a thought that id like to get feedback on.

Again, sorry for the typos.  Have a good one guys. 

Edit: Just wanted to clarify, the amount of inventory slots wouldn't change.  Maybe 3 defaults for weapons, and 2 for heals, although it can increase to max 5 on both slots by making the boxes smaller as you increase over default or having ""+"" boxes.   ",FortNiteBR

For example, when they initially released Greystone (Paragon), the new shotgun, guided missile, and port-a-fort (Fortnite), the games were broken immediately. Also, just like Paragon, Fortnite was a fantastic game initially until Epic started to add too many things that don't make any sense. Why add another shotgun when there are already two types? Why add a LMG when there is already a gattling gun? Why add a port-a-fort? Epic ruined something great in Paragon and they are doing the same with Fortnite.

Couldn't believe it was free, I rushed home to play. Called all my friends, some were skeptical, other didn't hesitate to download it too.
I've played everyday since it launched in September. Waaay back before skins, and holiday themed rockets, back bling, moving around after a victory, spectator count, battle passes, and to me most importanly, I was there before the entire Epic team switched over to focus on BR.

I just knew this was a mistake. Epic team together made Save the World, an ambitious project that no one really cared about, honestly. Too many moving parts, trying to please too wide an audience.

I'm afraid that's what's happening right now to Fortnite BR... All these new changes and updates are completely surrounded around the idea of making the game more fair to newer players.

Some of these changes have been good, Turbo Building and some quality of life updates to the UI were very appreciated. However, somehow, I am aware of the steps backwards this game is taking.

Before they changed how maps loaded in, things were almost perfect. The first change to loading the world made it impossible to land in Tilted, it's still impossible to land in Tilted, the lag spikes are ugly and we're never there before the first big ""fix"". Since then it's been fixing one big to make two more. 

The worst offense came shortly after Ninja, the biggest streamer, threw a tantrum over the double pump meta. Almost over night the ""fixed"" the issue. Adding a pumping animation, that bled into other weapons, causing player to ""pump"" a tactical shotgun they haven't fired yet. In order to fix that, they have implemented what I fear will be the slow death of this game. Weapon Delays.

Let's be real, this doesn't help anybody, the only ones who are happy about the change are people who get destroyed by better players who use these weapons to Max efficiency. Ninja, Myth, and your favorite players all move very quickly, flow in and out of building and shooting, using different weapons for different situations. That's pretty much done. The game has been slowed dramatically. 

Weapon delays, the Homing Misslie,(thank you for removing it Epic), and the Port of Fort are my biggest gripes with this game. It removes the incentive to get better, the drive to learn from your mistakes and get better.

People played this game for the skill gap. People watch Twitch and YouTube videos for the skill gap. To see difficult things happen like they were the easiest things in the world. It's why Ninja and Myth look like Jordan and Bird to us. 

Even Ninja said, ""Why are you stopping me from destroying people Epic"" in response to weapon delays. 

Today they announced they'd get rid of weapon delays for snipers, because it made no sense... Yet they refuse to see it makes no sense PERIOD for any gun to be delayed... Let's call it what it is, a fairness delay... Now ask yourself, how satisfied would you be to be killed by someone, constantly, because you switch to a gun with a fairness delay, and lost the beat needed to shoot first.

Epic I'd ask you to take a note for Bungie and Activision. The more you make a game for everybody, the more likely nobody is to play it. You don't have bungies fan base like it did with Halo before Destiny, the Gears loyalists still think Cliffy B works over there. You can't turn this gold mine of a game into the next bland cup of milk you want everyone to drink. Too many new BR games will be launching very soon, and Epic will have no one to blame but themselves when the player counts start falling.  

I love this game, will still buy season 4 battle pass because the quality of work in this free game is still insanley amazing. I say thank you to epic for this game, and for all of your hard work. But I beg you to take a chill pill, go back and look at what it was that made everyone around the world swarm to your game. And leave those features alone. In terms of the ""fairness delay"". Get rid of it, so what if a sweaty try hard kills me, so what if someone runs around with two pumps, most times a solid headshot up close does 9 damage anyway. 
If you think it will help, keep the delay on the rpg, it'd make sense since rpgs tend to be heavy anyway. But remove it from the other weapons. Fix the consistency and damage out put of the pump, which is your biggest offender honestly. And don't try to make this game for everyone, keep saying, Destiny 2, over and over in your head and you should be fine. 

Thank you for reading this, I'll see you guys in Tilted, before the meteor strikes that is.

427,jack_thread,1524001218,8d0bft,44,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8d0bft/the_great_debate_the_morality_of_killing_knocked/,24,The great debate: The morality of killing knocked players,"The truth:  There is no logical or moral ground on which to expect, demand, or think that other players should (morally/sportsmanship wise) not finish off a knocked down teammate.  To be clear, this is separate from the issue of a player making a poor strategic choice of focusing on a knocked player rather than his teammates.  In that case, criticism is made in the context of the player doing himself harm by making poor decisions that reduce his chances of continuing and winning. 

**First false argument**:  ""Well when you kill a knocked player you are ruining the fun for them and the other team and making someone sit out while their friends play"".

**First Response**: It should be obvious and needless to say that the whole point of the game is to kill everyone not on your team.  When you begin a game, you are entering a universal understanding that everyone else's objective directly conflicts with your objective.  You and your teammates should know that from the very beginning you will be putting a burden on all the enemies' gaming experiences.  Which is why it's called competition and not collaboration.  

Just because there is a knocked down mechanic in squads and duos, doesn't mean that the knocked down player is somehow protected from the nature of the game.  Just because the game offers players a ""second chance"" doesn't mean that they are for some reason off limits from the battle.  It's an illogically selfish mindset to think that a knocked down player is somehow granted immunity from what is going on in the game.  You aren't any more special crawling around being knocked down than you are being up and alive.

No one is an any position to put their gaming experience over someone else's.  Killing other players is fun.  Besides winning, it is literally the only other rewarding part of the game (unless you're just aiming to complete some shenanigans like rocket riding).  So you cannot logically expect someone else to put their fun aside for the sake of your fun.  It's selfish and pathetic. 

**Second False Argument**:  ""Well if you're the last person alive on your team and are about to be killed by 3 other squad members, you shouldn't kill their knocked teammate since you have 0.0005% chance of getting out alive and winning and will have no stakes in the game after you die"".

**Second Response**:  Pretty much everything mentioned above still replies. When you're knocked, you already fucked up, you already put the burden on your team, and you aren't owed any special treatment.  And to expand, you cannot demand that another player just give up and drop their gaming experience just because they're in deep shit.  As mentioned before, killing other players is a huge fun factor, and a player is fully entitled without moral question to continue having fun and finish their kills until they are sent back to the lobby. 

**tl;dr** when you're knocked, you already fucked up.  You already put your team in a shitty situation. You aren't entitled to special treatment just because you already fucked up.  You aren't granted selfishly special immunity. Your fun isn't any more important than the other players'.  Other players are allowed to pursue their fun and get kills until they die no matter what their chances are.

The same goes for the grenade launcher ; spam them where the enemy is and there you go, with a bit of luck, he neither has a base nor hp/shield left.

I am very happy that the guided missile got removed because I took so many L’s against it because I didn’t know how to easily defend against it. I am such a good player and I always dies to other players advance. Therefore I feel like every rocket related gun should be taken out because it ruins to game of Fortnite and cuts off the equality. 
I actually think that everything should get removed EXEPT for the grey ar, no shields, ONLY bandage as a form of healing, and of course materials, so that everyone has equal chances and so that I can really show my skill off. I am one of the greatest builders so I would easily go pro.. 

Okay really I think this is stupid and the guided missile really added a lot of fun and some easy kills on clueless noobs with ninja lookalike names.  

Btw don’t mind my grammar I used 5 min on this sorry :(",FortNiteBR

A week ago i was playing at 0.18 1600 dpi and this last week I've been playing with 0.06 with the same dpi.
The problem is that with this dpi i find it still hard  to land shots with the shotgun while it gets slow in building. 
It's like if i had 0.18 sensitivity when i get the shotgun (only with it)
And so im having a problem with shotgun fights. Something that usually happens to me is I outbuild the enemy but i miss all shots (shotgun) and end up dying.
If i lower the sensitivity it feels like if I needed a mouse pad the size of china (mine is 35cm wide). I already disabled mouse acceleration. Any suggestions?

With the launch of Xbox cross play there were numerous issues which still haven't been addressed. One of them being that a ""child"" Xbox account cannot do cross play. There were numerous posts on the Fortnite forums and Reddit but it was never acknowledged as an issue or added to any FAQs.

So to state it: **Child accounts can't do crossplay.**

To fix it, you have to **upgrade your account to an adult account.**


**How do I upgrade my account to an adult account?**

There is a lot of misinformation going around about this. If you have seen YouTube videos about using the family portal, try this - however for me it didn't work. I did the following:

Pre-requisites: You need a copy of an adult's ID, I used my driving license.

1) Log onto the [Microsoft Accounts page](https://account.microsoft.com/) and change the name and date of birth to that which is on the Id. Don't worry - you can change it back later. 

2) Go onto the [parental consent page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent#XboxHelp) and select ""Submit Proof of age""

3) Fill in the form and attach your Identification (take a photo on your phone and go onto google photos or ICloud is a quick way to do it)

4) Go onto the [My Support Page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/my/supportrequests?wa=wsignin1.0) and check that your request is showing, if it isn't showing after 24 hours try again: 

5) Keep an eye on the requests page, once they've actioned it should be upgraded within 48 hours

This did not work for me the first time as Microsoft made a mistake. Once escalated it was fixed instantly. Microsoft actioned mine within a few hours so hopefully it is quick for everyone else.

They continue to add things at such a rate that they can't be played with enough to find all of the issues with them. In addition, instead of throwing these changes in a test server like almost every other competitive game, they just throw the changes into live play. This can be good for a data perspective but it hurts them through the fact that they upset their player base who don't want to play with something that is buggy or OP. Look at the most recent changes, they added them and while adding them they increased the problem with what is called the peek glitch/dick bullets. Yet before they have even fixed that, they are announcing an LMG that they will be adding. It is the idea that they are changing things so quickly that they might be smothering it.

TLDR; EPIC might be hurting their game through too many big changes to the game at such a pace that the changes can't be fleshed out (in terms of bugs and possible adjustments) before they add something new in addition to just forcing it on the player base.

My Idea to be against tower camping and alway getting the high ground so the enemy has no chance to win: 
If you look up the crosshair is smaller then when you look down so you have more bloom when you shoot down. If it is balanced high ground is a advantage but not the save win. weapon damage fall off can be removed because there is no first shot accuracy anymore and you can‘t laser the enemy.

&amp;nbsp;  
**Peeking**
&amp;nbsp;  
In v3.4, we identified an unintended behavior with shooting that affected a small number of players. However, when implementing a fix in v3.5, we unintentionally introduced a bug around peeking over structures and edges. The result of this issue is that you would accidentally end up shooting your own structures. We will be rolling back this change in v3.5.2 this week, and we’ll be taking a little more time to evaluate how we fix the original issue.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Weapon Swapping**
&amp;nbsp;  
We recently introduced weapon equip times. This change was geared towards balancing quick switching between different weapons with low rate of fire (effectively bypassing the drawbacks that make these weapons fair). 
&amp;nbsp;  
After reviewing your feedback, we’ll be making a number of changes in a hotfix later today:
&amp;nbsp;  

* Snipers and Crossbows do not benefit as much from quick switching, so we’ll be reverting the equip time changes for those weapons.
 * We will be keeping the delay for the remaining weapons with the new behavior - Shotguns, Revolver, Hand Cannon, and Rocket Launcher. Note: All other weapons do not have equip times.
* Weapon equip animations will be improved in a future update. These are unfortunately somewhat misleading - it’s possible to fire sooner than the gun appears ready, so they feel more sluggish than they really are. You may notice this on a few weapons.

These two changes are an iterative step in taking another look at our weapon swapping and improving it for the long run. Please share your feedback as we continue to work on these changes.  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Guided Missile**
&amp;nbsp;  
We’ve gotten a lot of feedback around the Guided Missile, in particular concerns over fairness and strength of the weapon. We share your concerns, so we’ve put the Guided Missile into the vault while we figure out the next steps for for its future.

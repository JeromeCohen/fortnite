This made me take a minute to step back and breathe. I needed to reassess my idea of this game. I needed to change the way I approach a variety of different players new play styles and load-outs. 

Thinking this way has significantly improved the way I play, and I have seen a noticeable improvement compared to Season 4. When the meta changes we need to change ourselves accordingly.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8y2tru/tip\_dont\_judge\_a\_player\_by\_his\_kd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8y2tru/tip_dont_judge_a_player_by_his_kd/)  


Where I discussed why K/D doesn't really matter and that you should play the game for fun without looking at the stats because you will enjoy the game more. Also it's important not to judge a player only by his stats because that there's no way way to judge somebody 100% correctly unless you watch him play.  


My K/D last week was around 3-4, the reason for it being so low was because I only landed tilted on trump tower and I played extremely aggressive taking every fight, this allowed me to have more fun playing the game (especially in this stale meta).

Most of you guys agreed but a few people actually said that my argument was wrong and that it wasn't true.  


So after one week where I played a little bit more carefully and conservative here are my stats now:

[https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/J4YLive](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/J4YLive)  


It's important to note that I still landed tilted every game (except for twice in the new areas) on top of trump tower and I pushed most of people, I just played more conservative not taking EVERY single fight. Basically taking only fights where I was almost sure I would win.

But as I said in the last discussion, playing like this and only taking fights that I know I will probably win.. never puts me in stressful situations so I don't improve much. While playing more aggressive and being often in some really hard to win situations helps me being more consistent, more confident and I feel like I actually improve at the game. F\*\*\*k the stats :P !  


Have fun!  


PS: stats would be even higher if I only decided not to take tilted RNG tower every single match :)",FortniteCompetitive

Last season, i was able to win so much more than i am now, i am talking about reaching 35% win-rate at one point (in a certain week).

The recipe for my games are as follows: 

I completely clear out anyone at my landing spot 

Mid game i am rotating quite well, manage to find 2-3 people, among st them 1 poses a challenge, sometimes i lose here but rarely.

Comes late game, most notably the top 10, what usually happens here is that i either start fighting someone, and immeditaley get 3rd partied (In that case i learned that i need to finish fights quickly), or i just make a stupid mistake and die, this happens but not as often as getting 3rd partied.

then when around 5 people left, It's usually me, 3 campers, and 1 guy completely taking  a dookie on me.

I am talking about getting trapped, getting massively out-built, or again, making a mistake.

Did i just get worse at the game? how come my winrate dwindle down to 7% as opposed to 35% last season? did everyone just get massively better? am i not improving ? how come there is always this 1 guy, in every single match that i play, that manages to take a massive shit on me ?

How come i manage to face the most tough opponnets every match? 

I made a new account just to see my stats as of now, and i am standing at 6.21k/d  and 7% winrate.

What can i do to get better or stand a chance against those people? I get increasingly frustrated as it happens every match  i played for the past 100 games and it's really off putting.

I'm okay with this cause I play this game for fun and I can just solo when I want to improve skills or go tryhard mode.

I do have one problem that is really annoying, though. Often during squads (perhaps because we are not very good), it just kind of happens that a team we just encountered decides to all sit in a different 1 by 1 and spraying ar, try to land a snipe shot and spam rockets. They have no intention on getting closer unless we lose a lot of health. It becomes an instantaneous mid-range fight. 

I do hate when this happens, it's so not fun and I don't really know what to do either so I just  try to do the same. I can't really advance without being in a huge disadvantage.

Do note that I'm not talking about winning or losing the fight. I just find it so extremely annoying and frustrating. Even when we win we lose most our health and the fight drags so long that's easy for another team to just clean us up meanwhile. Most of all, it's really boring.

Do any of you have the same problem? Maybe we are just too bad at the game as a team, but I've been thinking and still don't know what we should do so that this doesn't happen.

Anyway, any suggestions will be much appreciated, thanks!!",FortniteCompetitive

The Perfect Console Setup.,"This was a comment I posted regarding a question on whether or not playing claw is worth it. In short, the answer is definitely yes and here's why.

Let me explain the disadvantage of playing with a normal style first, then I'll explain my controller setup, which I personally think is unsurpassed.

You have ~10 buttons to press and two thumbsticks to use in Fortnite. Without playing claw your hand setup is something like this:

-Index Fingers: 2 triggers each

-Left thumb: Movement thumbstick, Change material

-Right thumb: Aim thumbstick, 4 action buttons, touchpad/select 

Each finger/thumb has a ton of responsibility. Each finger has to move when transitioning between switching weapons and aiming, and also when trying to plave a different type of structure. Your left thumb has to move off the stick when changing material. Your right thumb has to stop aiming (most important thing) when pressing ANY action button, and you use those a LOT.

So focusing on the right thumb... whenever you jump, reload, or switch to your building menu, you can't aim. While this can't be seen as super important to most since you can't shoot while performing these actions anyways... Lining up these shots in advance is a huge advantage.

The fact is the less responsibility each finger/thumb has the more control you will have. Here's my setup, limiting every finger to as little buttons as possible. I play claw AND have a scuf, which allows me to use every finger besides my pinkys. My index finger normally rests on the right bumper but switches to Triangle/Y and Square/X when needed (resting it on the bumper reduces possible cramps). I have my left outer paddle to jump, left inner paddle to change material, and right outer paddle to building menu. Here's the responsibility each of my fingers have:

-Left Middle: Left trigger

-Left index: Left Bumper

-Right Middle: Right Trigger

-Right Index: Right bumper, Triangle, Square

-Left thumb: Left thumbstick

-Right thumb: Right thumbstick

-Left Ring: Back left paddles (Jump/Change mat.)

-Right Ring: Right paddles (Buidling menu)

Each finger has limited responsibilty and I have control over everything I do without limiting any actions I can take with my player. Keeping your right thumb on your aim has such a great advantage that I'm sure is known.

Before I had my scuf I still played claw, but didn't use my finger to press X/A and Circle/B as it would cramp. If you are able to use your finger to jit those buttons it would leave you at a greater advantage than having to use your thumb. Since i couldn't do this I was forced to buy a scuf.

Even if your finger is uncomfortable pressing X/A and Circle/B, I would still highly recommend swtiching to claw to give you the advantage of limiting your thumb and index finger to less buttons, even if you only have each finger on seperate triggers. This specifically is very important when building and any control scheme.

I forced myself to play claw when competing in Gears of War and I've noticed rapid improvement in my control ever since. Changing your setup is hard at first and very frustrating but I highly reccomend trying it and sticking with it until you have it down. After sometime you will notice change and you will be better than ever.

The problem is that it changed everything I used to do. Building is a little nerfed and shotguns too. I'm not complaining, I actually liked it, but I'm having trouble deciding what to use.     

My win% is 38%, but that is just because I'm not getting as many kills as I used to. I used to get 15 kills per win, now I get around 8. The reason for that is because I'm not confortable with the new guns/changes.     

Should I take smgs over M4? What about the new guns? Should I use Shotgun plus drum gun? If so, should I take an AR with it? What is worth picking up and what should I leave behind?   

I never know if I should take a blue m4 or green silenced smg.

I’ll start with a comment I left on a thread before

In the words of JasonR “I don’t fucking know dude, change my res, change my sens, change crosshair, fucking jerk off a few more times a day, eat a bunch of bananas and fruits”

Basically you wanna change the way you play, but unless you play for a team, or something, you shouldn’t worry about consistency. To get out a slump, my recommendations would be to drink some water, do a few push ups, and really focus and think about what you’re doing.

What you want to do is relax, if you feel like you’re in a slump and you can’t get out, then change something about how you play. Back in CS:GO I would get in slumps, and I just wouldn’t play, or I’d get on a smurf and mess around. You shouldn’t worry about being consistently good, as it will make your worse. Secondly, learn what has changed about the game, for fortnite, people are complaining about being lasered, etc. I believe this is happening (though I’m no expert) because people always relied on building over seeing. Before, if you got shot at you would build, now that the aim skill ceiling is higher, it’s time to start looking for people, by looking around, etc. instead of waiting to be shot at then taking action. Learning what you need to change about your playstyle can massively help you out a slump. Lastly, this is a temporary fix, if you’re in a game and performing bad, so some push up, sit ups, etc. drink some water, or maybe practice your aim. A common practice in csgo would be to flick from one spot to another over and over, in order to train your aiming. 

That should be about it, I’m no expert in the subject, this is just how I personally get out slumps and thought it would help. ",FortniteCompetitive

It can be rage inducing at times, but overall this game is very fun. At the end of season 4, there were several controversial buffs such as material nerf, C4 DESTROYING SKYSCRAPERS, and shotgun nerfs. Now, to be frank, the shotgun nerfs were annoying, but overall they were still viable. C4 went to god tier, and the mats nerf was just outright dumb. Rocket capacity was nerfed, and with good reason. But, all explosives also get a buff to compensate for it. 

We also saw the rise of weapons that dont look very hard to use at all. Lets look at the tommy gun. 50 magazine size, super common, great damage. The only downside is the slightly above average reload.Even the accuracy is good on it. So what do you have? A gun that on pc, is good. But on console, is a godsend. Lets take C4. People on console arent as good, thats fine. Its harder to play on that. What do they do to help them out? C4. 

So as you look at this post and see my ramble youre probably wondering why i even made this. And its to highlight a key point. *Epic will always cater to casuals simply for the reasons that in Fortnite, the skillgap is so fucking high AKA if you can build and are good at the game, you WILL dominate.* Because as it stands right now, people who dont play competitive and just play it for fun were getting curb stomped. It takes 1 good player in a lobby to win and destroy everyone in that match. In other games, its not like that. Causals dont want to play a game where they are getting destroyed every match or cant do as well because they dont have the time to dedicate to practice. They want to hop on, play a couple games, and do something else.

Epic is smart and dumb for doing this. To defend Epic, casuals make up &gt;90% of the playerbase. People who try to grind out wins and most of the people on this sub reddit are in the 10% that want to be the best. Others players simply dont have that passion. However, the top 10% will always move on from this game. It happened with h1z1, it happened with PUBG, and it will happen with Fortnite. And that simple reason is that when people feel that they die to bullshit and not because they got outskilled, people stop playing games. Its small things that add up and make players as a collective not want to play.

Ill close my post/rant by saying this. Fortnite, as of now, is too young to see where the game will be in a year. Do i see it not being as popular as it is right now? No. Big titles are coming out this fall and winter. If this game is as big as it is on Spring of 2019, ill be damned. Do i think this game will die the slow and painful death that h1z1 and PUBG did? No, the devs are clearly not dumb. They interact with the community and seem to have a brain.

TLDR; Epic is not focused on a competetive aspect of this game, and are instead focused on catering to causals, and with good reason.

I downloaded Fortnite BR on September 28th because I was told it was kind of like PUBG.  I've been in love with it ever since.

Here's what I've noticed.

The build battling meta wasn't really a thing for the first four or five months of the games existence.  Everyone seemed to love the game early on as well.

Now, build battling is common.  From my experience, it seems that any fight that takes place in the top 50 turns into a build battle.  The population is significantly better at the game today than they were in the beginning.

My question is...Is this a good thing?  I've always felt Fortnite was so fun in part, because of the combat variety.  Today, the variety is struggling because everything turns into build battles.

The current meta is not only bad if you appreciate variety, but it also diminishes the tactical nature of the game.  Good players frequently hop up and down out in the open trying to attract gunfire so they can ramp rush and build battle their opponent.  

This meta also diminishes Epics beautiful map design.  Before the building meta, your surroundings mattered a great deal.  Today, much less so because things devolve into build battling so quickly.  The flavor of the map is heavily muted due to the building mechanic.

Lastly, the current meta absolutely drives away new players as well as bad players.  I'm fascinated by people who don't like Fortnite and I always ask them why. The overwhelming complaint I hear is that everyone just builds over them and they die.  Less proficient players have very little chance to kill better players let alone win.

Some of you might already be implimenting this type of thought process into your game, but if you are not I would suggest taking it into account. Here is what I mean by the curve.. 

The curve represents how good your opponents loadouts are and how many materials they have at any time in the game. Obviously, the curve goes up as the game progresses (people get more mats, better guns, ect.) 

The most helpful thing for me is to know where I am at compared to where the curve would be. Here is an example: if I drop salty and find a blue suppressed smg, a half pot, and a green tac shotgun, I’m pretty safe in assuming that I am ahead of the curve. However, if I were 10 minutes into the game with only a pistol, a grey ar and 100 mats, I could obviously assume that I am behind the curve. 

Here is the implementation: don’t comepletely base your decisions off of the curve, but at least take it into account when making decisions. When I feel I’m ahead of the curve, I often will play more aggressive and can feel more confident in winning fights. When I’m behind the curve, I will often either play very passive or get super aggressive to get myself back ahead of the curve or die trying. It’s a good concept to at least consider. 

TL:DR.. When making decisions, consider what the loadout of your opponents could look like compared to yours and use that information as you will to make your decisions.",FortniteCompetitive

Or atleast increase the time the trap being ready to be used in 4-5 seconds?

Currently the trap, once placed on the structure, is ready to be used in around 2 or 3 seconds 

Combine this with someone is who able to trap you in a box When you ramp over them is a deadly combo

You might say just place a wall+platform after every ramp so you can edit your way out, i agree with you 100% 

However, you have to be EXTREMELY quick to edit your way not only your ramp, you also have to edit the wall or the platform that you placed in less than 2 seconds

Of course this can be done, but you have to be precise and there can be no errors in this small amounted time given to you

That is why I am asking to maybe increase the time a second or two longer for the trap to be ready 

This still makes its so it requires to be skillful enough to edit both structures, but also gives you a reasonable time to do so. Players that panic in this situation are still punished for doing so, and that ones that do get out continue to fight and give them a fighting chance.

---
    

Anyway, as many of you know, explosives have become the bane of building in the worst way- requiring little to no effort or skill from the player using the explosives to destroy the opposing player's structure. This can be frustrating from the builder's (and usually, the better player's) perspective, since anyone can freely spam explosives without even having to practice while you have to consistently practice and execute different building techniques under varying degrees of stress/nervousness and in the case of facing a squad, knowing who is building towards you, what angle are they attacking from, who is laying down suppressing fire, etc. and to top it all off, you have to manage your materials. 

This sub has advocated for different *direct* nerfs for explosives, mainly the grenade launcher and the C4, but I personally think that this could be a chance for the game to start focusing on balancing different building materials around the current weapon types within the game, instead of just ignoring it which has been the case since the game came out. This would mean explosives would be nerfed *indirectly* through building material.

&amp;nbsp;


As it is, metal is almost never used (or farmed) because its practically useless in a fight, the only use it has is to make sure you don't use either wood or brick which is much more useful because of how much faster they form, or in the case of not having any of the other two materials, well you'll just have to use metal and most certainly die because of how fragile it is when you're just putting it up. 

I believe metal could be balanced around explosives and as a result, metal would become much more valuable in a fight and it could become a direct counter to one damage type in the game, opening up a whole new meta where it would no longer just be about what weapons you take and how much wood/brick you have on hand to use, but also what kind of material you use to counter certain weapon types, potentially deterring mindless spam and instead promoting focused and well thought out fire/build fights.

An example of how I would balance metal to combat explosives:    

* A metal wall/floor/ramp/etc. could take much more explosive damage before crumbling, so lets say something like withstanding two C4 charges or two rockets before being destroyed (this includes when its just starting to form, so you wouldn't have to wait until its completely formed to withstand a C4, and once fully formed, up to three rockets/C4 charges).

* A metal wall/floor/ramp/etc. does not allow AOE damage to go through it. This would be the biggest buff IMO because if they are using explosives, you are safe when using metal while if you use wood or brick, the AOE damage would go through and still hit you, not to mention destroying the wall. This is also good for building bases since it would take more explosives to shoot it down, making them waste valuable ammo while also being vulnerable for a longer time.    

&amp;nbsp;



These two changes alone could make explosives much more balanced, *if* you adequately use metal as a counter. If this were implemented, using explosives would not be as braindead as it is now and would actually require some forethought, good aim, good positioning and awareness, so long as the opposing player also understands that metal is strong against explosives. For example, rocket/C4/grenade spam would be lessened greatly because now the player with the explosives has to aim for corners where the splash damage could hit two or more metal walls at the same time to get the most value out of a single rocket/C4/grenade, they would have to prioritize attacking wood or brick instead of metal which means they actually have to aim at something specific and not just any wall or ramp. This would also incentivize using metal when constructing the foundation or different parts that may become key parts since it would be much more safe against players using explosives to destroy the entire structure, giving you (the builder) more time to react accordingly. It would also reward more aggressive play in the long run since you wouldn't have to retreat at the sight of grenade spam or C4 spam. 

&amp;nbsp;


    
---

&amp;nbsp;


    
Now, you may be thinking, ""wow, two rockets/C4's wouldn't be enough to destroy a metal wall when its just been placed, and if fully formed, it can take three. Thats OP"" well that's just with AOE weapons, metal would still be susceptible to normal bullets and another building material (looking at brick) could become a good answer for continuous fire from weapons like the tommy gun/smg/mini gun. Not only that, but metal is much harder to find than both wood and brick, which would also kind of offset how much rarer it is to find a rocket launcher compared to an AR for example (btw it may just be me but its incredibly easy to find C4 imo) and it would also be harder to loot from another player after defeating because of said lack of metal sources, while you'll almost always get at least 150 wood from another player even when starting the match.    

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like to hear your suggestions and thoughts about this. I truly believe that there has to be more building mechanics and options in place if we want to make sure that this game continues to have a low barrier of entry, but a high (hopefully unreachable, let me dream) skill ceiling. There's way to much balance around weapons and not enough around building itself.

I still won a fair share of 1v2s and a few 1v3s, but I pretty much came out of all those fights with barely any health left. It got harder to fight multiple opponents in the current meta because not many people ran building shredders like the drum gun last season (not even going to talk about explosives, that's a whole other story). 

In season 4 it was easy to build in 1v2s because the AR just couldn't keep up with the rate structures are being placed. You place structures between you and one guy, and fight the other guy, making it into two 1v1s. This season, you have to focus a lot on rebuilding because otherwise SMG bullets will completely tear you apart This is especially true when you are 10-15m away from the enemy so you can't latch onto their structures. What you end up with is one guy putting pressure on you to rebuild whilst the other guy take high ground.

To an external observer, it looks like it was built with sheer brute force.

But if you look at how Epic is progressing with development, they don't seem any more sure about where they're going than before - they've just ramped up content production and done balance tweaks in a very reactive sense, not building towards a particular style, but rather just sanding off sharp edges and crowding the game with more stuff to do and see.

The question that I don't think they can answer is: ""what does this game believe in?""

With other well-liked, long-lived games there tends to be a blend of ""belief"" - what the game is intended to focus on - and ""justification"" - specific pieces of content and mechanics that support that belief. The justifications make the game a ""coherent truth"" - we accept it as true because the justifications all work well with each other, even if there are implausible surface aspects. And the more coherent the game is, the finer a point you tend to be able to make about what the belief is and how it's being justified, and the more likely you are to want to replay the game to engage with that belief, and not just ""to see all the content.""

|Game Title|Belief|Justification|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Team Fortress 2, League of Legends|Play as a team, with your preferred play style acting to help your teammates|A rich, deeply specialized set of character classes designed to create mutual support|
|Tetris, Minecraft, Sokoban|It is fun to play with blocks|Rules and features that encourage thinking about block configurations|
|Counter-Strike|The feeling of handling real guns in a action-thriller setting|Extremely detailed, yet non-realistic  gunplay, in the context of terrorism scenarios |
|Mario|It is fun to run and jump|Levels, obstacles and powers that complement and challenge running and jumping|

And if you try to apply this theory to Fortnite...it's going to be difficult. If the game were actually about fighting by building things, Epic probably would have done something to extend the building mechanics more directly or pushed the map and ruleset in a way that massively favors building. But they haven't - the building itself is a copy-paste from the PVE game, and the map really isn't designed around facilitating building(all those annoying gentle slopes!). Despite that, we still ended up with a build battling technique - which is kind of amazing considering how clunky the building system is, overall.

But Epic has basically said, ""the game is not about defeating your opponent by building over them,"" which leaves a big question mark over what it *is* about. Every part of the game as it stands lacks a bold statement of purpose. The gunplay is more-or-less required to be clunky and unsatisfying because they have taken on the task of accommodating all players on all platforms with every type of weapon one can dream up, and simultaneously make them all balanced in a statistical sense, and simultaneously make them all matter in a player choice sense - instead of letting go on one of these, allowing some guns to be ""fun but bad"" or limiting themselves to a few categories that can each be perfected for both balance and feel. And the game is not really about getting an information advantage either: sneaking up on someone is not a free kill apart from a few specific weapons and scenarios. It has teamplay, but the teamplay doesn't have too much in the way of clear roles, if all the complaints about ""bullet spam and splodes"" are anything to go by. It doesn't try to tie anything back into its original setting: the BR game has very little relationship to the Save the World game. The most reasonable answer I think you could give is ""it's a bit of this and that."" A middle-of-the-road, plain-vanilla game with a lot of ""stuff people like"" in it. It supports ""different playstyles,"" as if this were a bullet point list of compatibility with different languages or file formats. A game that is popular as a piece of software, not as an experience.

And that isn't an answer that could possibly satisfy a competitive player because it gives no direction to practice. Look at those other games. They have a direction. The old meta had a direction, even if it was accidental and limited in many ways. When you marginalize that, everyone will just default to the genre fundamentals of FPS/BR games...and those fundamentals motivate the slow gameplay that has developed. The game still has plenty of skill gap and the pros and streamers do an adequate job of demonstrating it, but skill gap or lack thereof is not why people are angry. They're angry because they want to practice something other than genre fundamentals, and they had a strong incentive to do that, but now they don't. They have a new meta, but it shows no promise of leading anywhere nearly as interesting. It's just, ""well, these are the strong guns now, use those, get gud""

So now we are in season 5 of the game, and they're adding more stuff(because when does a AAA dev *not* add stuff?). The big additions are...golf carts, rifts, and being able to shoot hoops. Is the game an open-world sandbox now? There's little technique needed to use either of the mobility options, so they're more utilitarian than advantageous to play, and they tie back in to the main game loop in a weird, jarring way that makes it harder to plan and predict rotations. The additional mobility also makes the storm relatively less threatening, diminishing that element of the original BR scenario. The new stuff just accompanies small variations in the generic ARG ""It Is A Mystery"" storyline, last season it was shards and this season it's rifts. And there's no sign that they're going to make a clear statement about what the game will be focusing on. It's just noise and shifting sands all around. 

And that's bad both in general, and in a competitive sense, because it means there's nothing to value here, no message being sent or ultimate pursuit that we can all agree upon. Epic isn't going to support your grind in a meaningful sense, they're just going to keep dumping more stuff on the game, snip off the loose ends and polish up all the edges, instead of refining any one part to the desired ""razor sharpness"". And the more stuff that is in the game, the more likely it will just be an overly-eager-to-please muddle instead of a coherent whole. In general, every game that ""dies"" in the public mind does so because it either just stopped developing(no new release, limited release), or it developed from unpolished-yet-promising to incoherent-muddle. The games that actually know what they're about, advertise themselves as such, and stick to it can survive through many different iterations.

But maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's overstated. Pretty much every game suffers from this issue in some degree, even the ones I upheld as examples. It just means the game is less memorable than it could be, and is unlikely to reach the heights we'd like it to, even if it's found its way into the commercial spotlight.",FortniteCompetitive

Non existing now that season 5 is all about spray and pray. Epic is lowering the skill gap every patch and it’s just sad. With shotguns you actually had to land your shots, and you could also strategically build to block shots from other shotgun users. But with this new smg meta is you even start to build your walls will just be melted through in .2 seconds by someone running 3 smgs. I haven’t had a single build battle since season 5 started and that’s what I truly loved about fortnite. I used to play around 4 hours a day but now I play about 1 or 2 games a day of that and hop off because the meta is just that stale.

After this content update splodes they decided to nerf: Reload speed, Max ammo and Rocket ammo spans. Splodes felt good in season 4 and 3, but not a must have weapon to win in late game. Now that season five is out and all splodes are overpowered you NEED to have any splodes to win, or atleast it feels like it.

First of all, I know a lot of people knew about this, and I have zero knowledge regarding network and ping. I was playing in playgrounds, and until yesterday, I thought scar or mini guns shots were suppose to go through someone spamming walls, but this is not the case. I noticed ping differences contribute to your shoots going through walls, and through your walls as well.

A friend of mine has 90 ping in brasil, and my girlfriend has 30. We got the mini gun and a scar in playground, and hold click to spam a wall and check out what happen if you spamm shooting vs spam wall.

When my girlfriend with 30 ping started shooting my friend with 90 ping with scar or minigun, some shoots would go through and he would receive damage. When my friend with 90 ping started to shoot my gf with 30 ping with a scar or mini gun, and she spammed walls, she didnt receive damage, not even 1.

So what I get about this (although I might be wrong), if you are fighting against someone and there is a 50-80 diffference in ping, spamming walls and shooting changes completely. Thats why when I play on east (90 ping), scar or mini guns would go through, because I was fighting low ping players.

People probably knew this, but me and my friends didnt, especially not at 90-110 ping, maybe higher.

Anyways, if anyone knows what more is affected by ping who could explain it, I would appreciate it. Thank youm

I want to see what the competitive side of players think about these changes, because they have a considerable impact on the overall gameplay.

As we all know Epic recently buffed the silenced and tactical sub machine guns, as well as adding The Drum Gun. They also just announced a new SMG. So clearly they want SMGs to be relevant, and I'm not saying this is  necessarily wrong of them.

They also recently made it so you cant effectively use two shotguns, by adding a delay between shots after firing and switching weapons. So everyone is only using one shotgun now. To me this is also an okay change, and it definitely secures the SMGs spot in a players loadout. 

Another change that really affected gameplay is the buff to explosives. Epic gave all splodes radius damage, which was originally unique to C4. They did this to try to stop players from camping, but from what I've seen this just makes it harder to retake high ground from someone camping on a mountain.

Epic has said they want more viable playstyles than ""just build lol."" To me the building is what makes this game super fun and grindable. It's a unique mechanic that has an evergrowing skill ceiling. Personally idrc about the nerf to double shotgun. SMGs should have a role, maybe not to the power level they're at now, but that's subjective. The main thing that concerns me is how insane splodes have become. In squads its especially noticable. Explosive weapons run the game now. It feels like they want explosives to be one of the ""playstyles"" that are viable or something.

The overall effect of these changes is that now
- Players are almost always picking up explosive weapons if they find them.
- Players can no longer get in long drawn out build fights as often because someone will just come by with any explosive and knock them both down.
- Players run out of mats considerably faster from defending against SMG/Splode spam.

IMHO splodes should be nerfed in some way. They could make grenade launchers and rocket launchers only spawn in crates. They could reduce the radius on the explosion for lower rarity weapons. I'm not a game dev or a genius and these are just ideas but i feel they need to be toned down in some way. Fortnite still has plenty of room to grow so well see what comes in the next few patches. Looking forward to hearing what this sub thinks.

I've played this game for quite some time and spent hundreds of hours in improving from all aspects, especially building and decision making. I've seen a lot of tuning changes, balancing, mechanics overhauls and been there for and a part of all the whining that goes on regarding them. However, I've never seen anybody talk about the current state of Turbo Building. 

Prior to it's introduction, players built at a relatively slow speed. Even for those who were quite decent, a ramp wall push wasn't a cakewalk and required good mechanical coordination. Turbo building came out and it was a quality of life improvement to those who couldn't click at a rapid pace, but individual clicking was still faster and offered better instant swaps to different building pieces. However, the most recent change to turbo building placed it at 20 clicks per second and it has completely upended the rest of the game by almost completely removing the need to individually click for each building piece and only needing to press different keys instead. The reason why Myth and Jaomock were such amazing players was because they could build at or near a current turbo build pace before it was even introduced. These players would completely outpace their opponents with rapid clicking/building swapping and good decision making which allowed them to get high ground rapidly. It was great to watch players that could break and replace an enemy wall to edit kill them because it was a counter to turtling that didn't involve C4,GL or RPGs and involved a lot of skill instead. 

Now that players can build with a computer doing one of the core components of building for them it's no wonder why EPIC has to keep buffing explosives and anti-building measures like SMG/minigun buffs and the durm gun in order to compensate. You think EPIC wants every scrub that can look in a general direction and click left/right mouse button to trump skilled players nonstop? It's because they've gotten on the Turbo Build ride and can't get off for fear of pissing off the players who think they're good because they can spam builds without realizing that the hardest part of the job is actually being done by a computer for them. 

Outside of the initial 1-2 minutes of carnage in a game, the other parts of it have significantly slowed down because player engages during mid game will last a lot longer than before due to spam building. Since building is such an effective counter against shooting, even players who lack good aim, decision making and general mechanics can stall a good player for much longer than before because swapping to different keys while holding down the left mouse button is a brainless effort. This is why turtling became such a dominant meta, because it became nearly impossible to contest a wall against someone who'd just hold down left mouse button while pressing down the wall keybind. That's 20 clicks per second. Who aside from CS:GO, LoL and StarCraft pros do you know that can do that? 

I get baffled seeing people talk about the explosives buff and the mat nerf without ever addressing the issue of computer assisted spam building. Worse is that they have the gall to call it a lowering of skill when turbo building was the greatest lowering of the skill gap ever introduced in the game and barely anyone bats an eye because it's beneficial and helps them skip one of the more fundamental aspects of PC gaming, which is improving their Clicks Per Second. 

I've benefited from Turbo Building a lot myself, so it'd be hypocritical of me to call out others using it without mentioning myself, but I genuinely think it's one of, if not the biggest factor in the lowering of the skillgap to date. It's what allows players with no sense for other parts of the game to force you to waste a significant amount of mats during fights. It's what causes unnecessarily extended encounters because a player can keep spamming builds to try to get your high ground or just turtle there and sit almost completely unscathed (especially if they put a roof piece up as well). It's extra dangerous in solos because the longer time it takes you to try to kill them, the greater chances of a 3rd party player coming in and cashing in on both of you falling to your death from 50 meters, or you being out of resources since you spent it all fighting one guy. It's why EPIC has to introduce disgustingly broken explosives in order to try to counter the insanely spammy nature of turbo building.

**tl;dr** - turbo building is an insane lowering of the skillgap which greatly disadvantages actually skilled players that have a good balance of building, aiming and decision making. The super strong explosives meta exists because each player with 999 wood and 3 keybinds can endlessly spam their builds without requiring any real mental or mechanical prowess to use.

However, there’s now a bigger problem with the end circles than ever before.

They’re impossible to run from!

It’s ridiculous, you can get unlucky to the max with the end circle spawning BEHIND an enemy metal base. You’re forced to run and build like a fucking madman while sprayed town. You get overtaken by this circle, it’s just ridiculous how RNG the end games have become.

They avoid base camping, but these scenarios are even worse!

So, half the speed of the current end game circles, making it possible to build and run from them. ",FortniteCompetitive

I've managed to narrow it down to where if you quickly place a ramp (LT) and switch back to a weapon it will ADS without you pressing LT. Again I'm not sure if this is console exclusive.

The most valuable resource in this game is health/shields, especially in the turtle-heavy competitive play. Pushing people drains that precious resource to a point that someone who just looted the first 15 minutes of the game has a significant advantage over you. Especially if they decide to push the fight right after it ends and the brave team is healing/looting or while it’s nearing its conclusion when every participant is weak.

Good players will also drain half their mats and with the explosive buff that amount is being generous. 

I propose this:
Every kill either default gives you ~15-20 health/shield. Maybe 10 shield and 10 heath. Either that or it drops an orb on the dead body you have to pick up that gives you that much. It also possibly gives you 30 of each material. Whether it should go to all teammates is up to debate but definitely the player that got the kill/picked up the health orb.

Minishields are great but you’re still at a sizable disadvantage at only 125-150 health.
Not to mention the time it takes to heal to that amount of health after a close fight. People don’t push because for the most part it’s only disadvantageous to push. Even incentivizing kills with points isn’t worth it, because if you turtle till the end you’re gonna get at least 4 kills AND the win bonus (that people are talking about). This would make people much more likely to push and as a result, result in a much more exciting game to watch and play. Points for kills and more in-game incentives is what competitive play needs imo.

(Also move the circle times a bit closer to blitz’s for added excitement)

186,jaxofficial,1531720793,8z8h18,48,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8z8h18/smg_meta_is_stale_boring_and_discourages_building/,12,"SMG meta is stale, boring, and discourages building","**Background**: I have 1000s of hours in Battle Royales and have played every single one that has came to market. I have played Fortnite since you had to actually pay for the full game to get in on the Beta version of Battle Royale in September and have continuously played throughout every season and maxing my battle pass every season as well. I have been through a lot of metas and changes throughout the games past with the most rewarding and fun season IMO being Season 4 because of actually being forced to learn to build and use shotguns well. You would get in massive build fights with shotguns up close and one pump people if they weren't careful enough. I also have 600+ wins total with a 6+ KD and 20% WR in Season 4 if it matters.

I mean seriously the SMG meta is the most boring meta I have ever seen in Fortnite. I have never had to take breaks from Fortnite really until this meta. I used to be able to play all day and it would be hard to get off with the fast-paced aggressive shotgun meta with giant build battles and rewarding gameplay. Now you are pretty much rewarded for trying to knockdown the player's building instantly because the SMGs shred buildings and people. It essentially just ends up in a bloom battle because the person that is building is just constantly burning through mats if the other person has an SMG. I seriously don't carry an AR anymore and am about ready to just straight up not carry a shotgun.

**The SMG:**  

* Does **way** too much damage per hit  

* Ruins building and fun giant build fights  

* Has **way** too tight of a spread  

* Doesn't really require you to aim because bloom exists

* Has a super high fire rate

If the shotgun meta were to be brought back, it would:

* Reward accuracy  

* Reward fast building and editing 

* Allow high skill players to always kill people who do not know how to build

* Bring back super long, fun, and rewarding build battles

* Reward the people that put in 100s or even 1000s of hours to learn the mechanics of the game

* Make solo squads actually do-able again

Thanks for reading, and I hope this meta changes very quickly. Even a **SLIGHT** nerf to SMGs would be enough to make this game more enjoyable for me again and might make build fights happen more often. They need to nerf the SMG's damage to buildings quite a bit in my opinion. Also, I figured I would post this here as I would literally get probably harassed in the regular Fortnite BR sub because the general population has less than a 2KD.

TLDR: The shotgun meta was way more rewarding for high skill players that actually took time to learn building, accuracy, editing, etc. Meanwhile, the SMG meta rewards players that know how to hold Mouse1 and look in the general direction of your character without even knowing how to build that well. Super long, fun, and aggressive build battles with quick edits and fast builds are simply just no longer achievable with this meta which is what made the game boom and take off with many skilled, mechanical players hopping on board.

today i wanna open a discussion about the current meta in Fortnite.
This is NOT a whine thread i want to hear honest opinions.
First some facts about me so people can understand where im coming from...
I´ve started playing fortnite 1 week after it became free to play and the meta got changed alot in the time. I´ve played till lv 100 each Season and were 3ish days into S5 and im already fed up with the game.
I actually like S5 way more than any Season before but the Meta just does not do it for me.
The current Meta feels so awkward since the skillgab in this game got completly ""destroyed"".
I was never really a fan of double Pump or any double shotgun loadout that existed but after it got completly dumbsterd i now know that it serverd a purpose. 
Now that this purpose is gone and serveral changes were made the game feels awkward to play.

The thing i want to talk about are the Weapons... 

Pumps = Dead
Full power Double Pump ""S1""-S2 was busted it needed to get nerfed and the nerf it got was really good.
Im talking about the Pump delay people are bitching about now a days.
After they lowered the DMG of the pumps to buildings i felt like they were 100% balanced.
With double pump you could shred through everything and could kill everyone in a small time window so the nerf was really good for the health of the game.
So then nerf Nr 3 happened and the Pump could not 1 shot anymore.
At this point the Pump got useless in my opinion its whole purpose was gone.

Tac shotguns were bad from the beginning the DMG was way to inconsistent and it only had a small range but a good fire power to compensate for it.

Heavys have a good balance since day 1 the only thing i would have liked if the Golden heavy could 1 tap.
Epic should have done 197 and Legendary 200+ 
Reason? its rare and should keep up with the pump even tho its a better version it dealt less dmg even tho its a legendary/epic weapon.
People on the normal sub reddit said that the shotguns were way to OP but the whole Point of the Shotguns was burst dmg in close quarters. 
You had to hit every single Bullet into the HEAD to 1 tap and it wasnt easy to hit a good oponnent anyway. 
There was a perfect clip from Daequan where he showed how to counter Double pump.
Just build lol. Its fortnite this quote became a meme but literally all you have to do is Build and outplay your oponnent it doesnt matter whatever the hell your enemy uses.

So now were getting to the real point...
Since the start of S5 double shotgun was completly removed so what are the players using now?
Smgs....
Those tiny little weapons are used for EVERYTHING and i hate that meta.
They are better then any AR, deal more DPS then any single gun in the game.
i remember a post about vaulting the silenced smg at the start of S4 when people learned they vaulted the crossbow.
Smgs in general got so good that people wont pick up AR´s anymore they literally serve 0 purpose now.
Bursts were in a bad spot since the beginning they´re just unusable in the current meta.
People thought the famas was the savior but guess what no its garbo.
Scars are somewhat still relevant but only for a range of 50+ m anything closer is Smgs.
I think the changes to the SMG were good at the beginning but after the second buff they got out of hand.
In the beginning they served 0 purpose but now they´re everything.
The problem with that is the Skillgab every fight right now is spray and pray and not like it used to be with AR´s.
You literally can get off 1 shot from any shotgun thats not a pump before your dead in a headon fight building is somewhat an option but smgs just laser through them anyway.
No skins nowdays feel like an actual thread when they only need 5 bullets out of 30-35 to kill you and it takes 0 skill to hold the button and pray.
Double shotgun atleast took SKILL not everyone could do it not everyone could do it as fast as others.
People needed to train double pumping like crazy to get to the top and even then building literally cancled the whole mechanic out not like smgs.
I really think that SmG´s should get nerfed hard really hard i dont want to feel stupid to use a AR or Burst.

On to the next point Explosives.
Holy shit i dont know what epic thought about adding the recent change they implemented but this is busted².
1 Rpg can destroy your whole 1x1 
Clingers can kill you trough your walls and granades became so relevant that you would drop everything for them except for SMGs ofc lol.
C4 is totally fine imo since you have to place them first and splode them after it takes time and thinking to use them but the rest of the splodes got out of hand.

At first i thought this was a nice addition to bring down the 1x1 bases and would bring an end to endgame camping but guess what no.
Since the start of the new season pushing someone with atleast 50 IQ is impossible. 
Double rampin and going for the quick kill? Guess what No not anymore.
You´ll get stickied C4´d and Rpg´d to the ground all day long.
Have you tried to push against the ""new"" RPG? 
Double rampin with protection does nothing literally nothing anymore since the RPG blows up everything you build in 1 hit.
12 is the maximum of rockets you can use and its still more than 1 k Wood. 
It becomes even worse if you play Solo vs duos or vs Squads.
Explosives are everywhere no one tries to fight anymore you´ll just get naded into the oblivion.


The whole Solo vs anything got destroyed which in some point is good since only a small percentage of players should be able to do this and even then only the best players in the game.
I can imagine a group of no skins killing people like tfue ninja dae and stuff just with rpgs´ clingers and smgs.
There is just no counterplay anymore.
Buildfights got comepletly irrelevant since its way to risky nowdays it only takes 2 rpgs or 2 clingers to end everyone on the building.



TLDR 

Metagame is boring af.
Explosives and SMg´s are completly busted and AR´s and Shotguns are nearly irrelevant.
This spray meta just makes the game boring and if you try to outbuild or get into a buildfight you´ll just get destroyed by explosives without a single chance of living.
The Meta at the end of S4 was perfect IMO here a list of common things i saw:
Pump + Smg 
Pump + Pump
Pump + Tac
Single Tac 

What do we have now ? 
Tac + Smg 
Pump + Smg 

The meta got shifted way to hard and isnt really fun anymore due to listed points.
Ofc some people really hated the double pump meta but imo it was way better then what we have now.

You have to find the players of course, which makes rotations a skill (o7 CloakFue), but this is not consistent because players will be everywhere in public matches.

So, the Friday Fortnite is great entertainment, but it does in no way show actual skill within the game.

In other words, there’s no major incentive for pushing for kills. 



Changes
&gt;•After dying you respawn just like in playground (the respawn location could be randomized after every death to avoid spawn killing)
&gt;•After each circle (aside from maybe the first circle) the ‘x’ amount of players with the lowest amount of kills are eliminated until ~10 players remain
&gt;•Finally those 10 players finish out the game like a normal BR

This way, players are incentivized to go for kills to stay in the game. They have no idea how many kills they need to stay in every round so getting into as many fights as possible is mandatory. 

While dying isn’t nearly as punishing as it used to be, killing becomes a lot more rewarding. Also, by staying alive in the early rounds, you’re able to keep your loot and get progressively stronger while players who die have to reloot. Killing a stronger player will most likely reward better loot since they most likely killed and looted other players.

This format where players are eliminated based on kills would be a lot more action packed than the current camping meta. There would no longer be 30 people in the final circle causing the game to lag and pretty much be unplayable.

Yeah yeah downvote the crap out of this, I dont care. (But I do so please have mercy!)

I actually uninstalled the game last night. I have played 53 games in season 5. 38 of them I/we ended up in the top/3/5/10. Won 7 of them. 22 of them were lost due to unlucky moving circles.

I really like the idea of a moving circle. However, I think that 1. The circle should not move faster than you can sprint. 2. The circle should have the ability to sometimes still be within the current circle (not out in the storm.)

Right now, it is too random and based on luck. Whichever team(s) or individual is closer to the next storm will win. All they have to do is shoot at the other team who HAS to come to them. This either 1. Kills the team, or 2. Slows them to the point where the storm catches them and kills them (because it's faster than you can sprint.)

I understand that this is to help the casuals be even against the competitives, but to the competitives, it doesn't matter what guns you get, where you built even a small structure, or all the battles you won earlier in the game, if the other team is closer to the storm.

Example: A solo with 0 kills won a game in Duos because the other 3 duo teams died in the storm.

Example: We destroyed 4 duos running in because we slowed them down, causing them all to die in the storm.

I just end with greater frustration then the amount of fun I am having, and it is just no longer worth it the 20 minutes of strategy and battles to lose to RNG. Started first day of season 2, 3000+ matches, so I am pretty disappointed. Definitely one of my most favorite games.",FortniteCompetitive

Accuracy in this game now is you literally just holding fire and hoping the aim assist treats you well.  You can barely fucking strafe and there is no difference between a potato and a pro shooting an smg since the best aim is no aim.  Console aim is about strafing and timing more than right stick accuracy.  This worked well for shotguns because you only needed to get your aim on their head for a split second.  SMGs you need to hold your aim on them and the only way to do that is to hold ADS and pray.  Going for headshots isn't even the proper way to aim since bloom will make you miss half the shots and make it not even worth it.

When you combine this with all the nerfs to shotguns, the buffs to splodes and how easy it is to spray down building now, this game has become a shitshow and isn't even close to as good as it used to be.  The new additions are great for the game in my opinion but the core mechanics are at the worst they have ever been.

1. In pro play, on average, almost every 1 on 1 fight is a 50/50 chance of winning or dying, since players are roughly the same skill level. This means 5 1v1 kills is a 3% chance of surviving, versus just getting the last kill being 50%. The reward for kills would have to be *massive* to justify that.
2. Kills are often *not* based on 1v1 aggression right now, but instead being in the right place at the right time. Since true 1v1's are uncommon mid-late game, fights are suicidal to take anyway and often result in *less than 50% winning odds.* Furthermore, kills are most *safely* secured from being in the right place at the right time encouraging even the advantaged players into turtling from the best angle provided, often based on circle luck. The longer you live, the more kill chances you get. *Living is always key.*
3. Even assuming the aforementioned are completely refuteable, scoring systems have no real way of forcing players to play the encouraged way in a given match. When you're stuck in an enclosed box in the final circles, kills aren't something you can viably force to happen in the game presently anyway, and no scoring system is going to change that. The best many players will still be able to do is try and win, however little points that gives. The few players in power to force good scores in their games will often be there by more luck than skill, or during early game when there's room to bend their play a little, and somehow I doubt players in these positions are often going to risk it when other players have no reason or desire to fight each other anyway; you'd just wait until they are most exposed (circle closing in) before pushing your advantage anyway.

I'm of the belief that no scoring system is going to fix the meta as it is right now, especially given how arbitrary scoring systems often feel. Unfortunately, the best way to fix the meta is to fix the gameplay loop, so players *feel* obligated to play the desired way. The best way to encourage aggression is to *make it a players only option to win.* Imagine if not every single player had whatever the meta loadout is (ar, shotgun, explosives, healing etc...) and would stand no chance against the top players without risking their lives for a kill to get those items. Perhaps this is better attributed to materials: Imagine if getting a kill was actually a reliable way of restoring your material count, or perhaps if the three tiers of materials were more meaningful so to win against the top player later you needed better ones, forcing you to fight to ensure you had them... I'm sure there are better suggestions out there, but I'm of the belief that the best way to force people to fight is to make fighting a *match winning condition* instead of a tournament winning condition. Besides, if we do make it a match winning condition, we could simplify scoring for viewers and accuracy significantly by factoring in only player positions, since player positions would already, by nature of the game at this point, be influenced more significantly by kill count.

TL;DR: Instead of making tournament scoring systems be based on kills, make winning an individual match be based on kills. (as in, getting a kill should provide a meaningful boost to power, highground advantage, etc that other players would be encouraged to prevent you getting.) This allows us to accurately prioritize player positions in tournament scoring and encourages aggressive play by the game's players, which in theory would boost the viewing experience of the game.",FortniteCompetitive

Example: i just killed a guy, i had about 120 health left.  Some bot is walking towards me completely unaware, i ramp towards him, he throws 2 grenades that break my 2 ramp/walls (neither hit me), i hit him with a purple heavy, he *pulls out his pickaxe*, i hit him with the heavy again, he *swings his pick axe*, i hit him again, he pulls out an smg, i hit him a fucking gain, i go to pull out my green tacsmg to finish him because im in disbelief that i havent killed this idiot yet when i havent missed a shot, i hit him with one smg shot before he melts me 120-0 with a purple tacsmg.  

From this i learned:  Shotguns are so awful that there is literally no fucking reason to shoot a shotgun more than once if your smg still has ammo.  Which i dont agree with at all.  

And also: i didnt build any more after the grenades took out my ramps because Im hitting this dude several times, 100% accuracy, with what i thought was a good weapon.

I feel as though it would be a much better course of action to rework how competitive play is... well... played. The concept of building adds for an exciting new layer of shooter combat never before scene in competitive E-Sports and it would thrive much better in a true E-Sports environment where teams are fighting against each other for an objective rather than just to be the last man standing. 

I know this is quite a radical change from how Fortnite is right now, but if taken seriously, could make Fortnite one of the biggest E-Sports of today. 

Epic should not be limited to battle royale just because it is Fortnite’s origin. Some games are meant to flourish into something better than what they are and I believe the competitive scene absolutely needs a total rework.

When I'm talking about keybind I don't mean just build binds but also gun binds.

First I'm going to talk about build binds and secondly I'm going to talk about gun binds.

All of these bind proposals are based on WASD.

Ok, build binds, there are 3 ways you can bind your builds effectively. 

The first way is the 'spread-out' way. This means that you use 1 finger for each of the first 3 builds (wall, floor and ramp). A great example of this is HighDistortion. He uses Q (ring finger) E (index finger) Mouse button (Thumb). The downside of this way is that you have to move your fingers alot, which is confusing to some people. I Iike this one more than the other ones (I use Q mouse C). But like I said in the beginning, it's personal preference.

The second way is the '1-finger' way. If you do this you have 3 buttons close to each other for the first 3 builds. Tfue does this (CFV, all for 1 finger), the downside of this is that you nearly eliminate one finger for movement.

The third way is the 'mouse-only' way. Some people use only buttons on their mouse for building. The advantage you have when doing this is that you can keep your fingers on WASD so you always have full control of your movement. The downside of this is that swapping is slower than the other ways. An example of this is cizzorz. All 3 of his main build buttons are on his mouse.

Then, the pyramid and trap, both less important than the main 3 builds but at the same time they can be very useful. 

Pyramid: when you have floor bound to your keyboard use a mouse button for this (or another finger), and when you have floor bound to a mouse button, bind to a button on your keyboard which is fairly easy to reach. (Something like V or T is good for this)

Trap: doesn't really matter, as long as you can reach it without moving your hand completely it's fine.

Now the last part, editing, also very very important. Imo this button is as important as your main 3 build binds. It's a good idea to have this in another finger as your floor and ramp if those are on the same. Since otherwise it's very very hard to do the ramp floor edit ramp floor edit strat to push up to someone. I propose you use F or L-Alt for editing.

I've had so many solo games where I've landed Wailing Woods and still ended with 10+ kills. Why should the person playing passive early and midgame end with more points than someone who fought and won the entire early and midgame with a low amount of materials, but then placed sixth. It should be high risk high reward to play aggressive early game and not low risk high reward to play aggressive late game. [Here's my idea that I came up with about a month ago. The numbers might need some fine tuning, but I think it's a good starting point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8rykz1/proposal_for_epic_games_tournament_format_that/e0v8oas/)

It's way more interesting to watch people fight early-, mid- and late game, than it is to watch someone farm loot and materials for the first 10 minutes and then only take the safe fights late game.",FortniteCompetitive

- Combination of the building mechanic being used in a defensive manor is OP.

- Huge players numbers in small areas. I personally do not think epic games will be able to fix the server lag.

- Early game is fairly boring to watch as an Esport.

- Its impossible to spectate all the action with huge player numbers. Potentially making spectators miss fights such as tfue vs myth for example.

There are so many more reasons. Battle Royale as an Esport is not healthy for Fortnite. So far it has only ruined Fortnite's competitive reputation.

A 5 or 7 round based mode where 1 v 1 or 4 v 4 teams on a tiny scaled map can compete against each other would be better suited.

The building mechanic is so unique and fun that to restrict it into a Battle Royale mode would be to kill it off.

This happens because the first option when placing a new structure gives you the option to rotate and edit the structure before it has been placed. I believe the best solution would be to have that as its own button(right directional) when in edit mode.

e.g. PS4: Press circle to enter build mode &gt; press right directional to enter rotate &gt; Click R1/R2/L1/L2 for which structure you want to rotate &gt; click right directional to leave rotate option.

This would allow for structures to build instantly when switching between them, making double ramp/wall, double ramp/floor/wall much quicker and easier.

**TLDR**: *Making rotating structures it's own button(right directional) so we don't have to double click when switching between structures. This will allow structures to place instantly.*",FortniteCompetitive

This way players are forced to kill to have a chance at winning the game. It does so too without introducing a confusing point system over multiple games.

This would also decrease the amount of time farming in the early stages of the game. Maybe each kills should add 100 per material to your cap. I think they should really test this kind of system out.

Some of my ideas might incentivize actually fighting and reduce the amount of players towards the end of the game


1. Reduce material caps to 500 of each, but double harvesting rates and make brick and metal more readily available.

This accomplishes two things:

It punishes players who camp and turtle as they can’t spam build to protect themselves.

However, you aren’t punished for playing aggressive and getting into a build battle because it is much easier to reach maximum materials. If you win but are low on mats, you can just harvest and be back into it quickly

2. Make the E-Sport version be based in a modified Blitz, not normal Battle Royale. The modified Blitz will start with the storm formed, but there is a normal glide period, then a 30 second grace period before the storm closes in. This heavily punishes players who land on the edge of the map and stay right on the edge of storm


3. This might sound a little crazy, but reduce player health to 50/75, and heals only allow you to reach 50/75. However, you can reach 100/100 by shooting other players, which grants you 1/2 of the damage you deal to players. So if you hit a 66 damage headshot, you would receive 25 health and 41 shield. Players who don’t engage will be heavily punished in the end of the game as they will be weaker than players who have previously fought.

4. Reduce the inventory to 4 slots and add a dedicated grenade/splodes slot. B

my suggestion to ""fixing"" build battles: either one or more of the following

1.) nerfing mats &lt;-- most will probably hate this (even myself)

2.) storm deals damage to players buildings.

3.) player build structures (wall/ramps...) has lifespan. meaning it actually self destruct after a certain amount of time.

I guess my question to you is: how can Epic improve?

-the other streamers are basically quietly stewing because again, sooo much money is on the line and the game is breaking

-lag has been an issue in the pro scene for basically months. Disabling c4 works a little bit and has been attempted by epic before but there are still so many explosives and buildings it doesnt matter. Why would it work now?

The saving grace of these summer skirmishes will be the rotating format, we will see what the next one brings. There have been some intense endings but its mostly camping, im switching between 4 streams and its mostly camping. Camping.

I just feel with the latest patch that there is less variety in close combat scenarios than before. Don't get me wrong i've been a mainly pump smg type of guy for my main/most common close combat load out, but with the latest patch i just feel like this has become close to the only option for optimal close combat load outs. I still ran double pump or pump tac sometimes when i was feelin saucy or just wanted a change. 

Double pump/ double shotgun had already been nerfed pretty hard with the damage changes that both of the more common shotguns saw, and, with the insane buff that the smg's saw i feel it was pretty obvious that pump smg was the superior loadout. That doesn't mean double shotgun wasn't fun as fuck sometimes though. I'm just saying it was nice letting people kind of mix and match different guns that fit their play style better, seeing people drop double pumps, pump tac, shotty smg, it was kind of cool that nobody had to really run the same thing. I'm just trying to say i feel like things are already starting to get stale, everybody literally running the exact same thing. what do you guys think? sorry for the long post.

It’s almost like everyone’s in a Friday Fortnite Tourney and the only score that matters is the kill counter. I know a lot of you people are going to say I’m just complaining because I’m getting downed a lot. And partially that’s true. But I find it more frustrating when one or two teammates are finished quickly from thirsty players leaving the team to either a) wipe or b) finish the game while the others sit out. Now I in no way think this mechanic is bad, but I just think somethings wrong when players focus more on finishing an individual than fighting to stay in the game.

However, with it comes a lot of inconsistency where I'll go on an absolute tear then play like a potato in the blink of an eye. 
   As a result, I decided to purchase a new mousepad and it feels completely different. With the lack of a wrist rest, a surreal slickness when I move my mouse, and just general aiming, I've been struggling plenty (rip s5 stats).
   For my sensitivity too, I originally had 1000 dpi and .12 ingame due to my small mousepad. My new one is a little bigger but the ""smoothness"" of the mousepad throws me off everytime. For sensitivity, what should I be conscious of when experimenting?
   As of now, I'm following the 360 degree rule and rocking 1000 dpi and .09 ingame. I feel like this is a little high but my mousepad's size doesn't allow for much lower.

 When aiming, do you guys actually watch specifically to where you are placing your crosshairs? I know it sounds obvious, but I usually am looking around my crosshairs in a gunfight more than I’m looking straight at it. One day I tried actually tracking my crosshair instead of assuming where it is, and I’ve definitely noticed an improvement in aim, at the expense of less peripheral vision.  

 Is this obvious and I’ve just been missing out, or so other people do the same and look “around” your crosshairs?

This is even worse in duos and squad with whole teams just jerking in their 1x1s. Nobody wants to watch that, and it’ll die as a result.

The problem is that there’s no incentive to kill because the objective of the game contradicts its game mechanics. You’re way more likely to get top 10 by hiding in a hut than fight people. Giving points for kills is a good idea but it’s very hard to balance. 

I know the competitive scene is still developing and Epic is still learning how to set it up, but do you think BR is a viable competitive game mode? What about control points or death match or search and destroy or something similar to playground 1v1? Maybe we can get them as a LTM first. ",FortniteCompetitive

Now that that's out of the way, there is still an issue here. Upon making double pumping not a thing, they have collectively made single pumping not a thing. When I first started playing the game, I seen a lot of green pumps. Obviously, I'm gonna scoop them up. Keep in mind, I actually stopped running double pumps 3 or so weeks ago seeing the inevitable nerf. Granted this was definitely warranted. Problem is, yes, remove the double pump. Why make them this weak though? From my experience, the blue pump is still viable, the green ones is where I see all the issues. Those things are terrible now. I'm not saying they should one shot, that was just as bad, but why nerf them into the ground? It's now the worst weapon in the game unless you find a blue one. I've seen plenty of times in a 4 hour period, where I hit at least 8 pellets at 5 meters, only to see at best 60 damage. At first I thought this was a bug, but it's legit. The problem wasn't the pumps themselves, it was the fact you could run two of them. Yeah, you remove the double taking of them, but while doing that, you render running one of the green ones completely useless. Anything will beat it out close range now. It's far too slow, and the damage has been nerfed. Why would you give zero incentive to run it by itself? Where is the motivation to ever pick it up now?

I know this seems like I'm a butthurt shotty abuser, but trust me, I'm not. I just find this very confusing balance-wise. I hated the double pump as much as anyone, and I used it during my time learning the game. I gravitated away from it because I felt it was cheap running two of them.  ",FortniteCompetitive

I would say I'm a pretty decent player, I can build and shoot pretty well. From what I've experienced, I think I have 2 (maybe 3) flaws. 

-I think one of my main weaknesses is panicking, shaking, and pressing wrong buttons when under pressure. What can I do to stop that?

-What can I do to stop those darn campers in the final circle? I hate when the final battle comes down to a sniper battle between two people on separate mountains. Most of the time I never get a chance to peak because they are just waiting for that split second to click on my head, while they are completely out of sight. They might also be spamming rockets or grenades (Not much now because of the nerf). Then, most of the time the storm goes in favor of the other guy and I have to drop down and lose equal/high ground with the other guy, who is now spamming bullets while I try to build up to him. I find this really annoying and I need help with dealing with that.

-Maybe another flaw is my keybinds. My sensitivity is 800 dpi and 0.7 sens. Right now, my keybinds are Q for Toggle Pickaxe, Mouse Side Button 1 for Wall, Mouse Side Button 2 for Stairs, C for Floor, V for Roof, F for edit, G for repair, and Mouse Scroll Button or 2 for first slot. I think some of these keybinds are limiting my performance, particularly the Toggle Pickaxe, first slot, and roof. Any tips for that?

I think people are discounting the affect that rifts have. Though they aren't on the entire map, when you can use them they give you a bird's eye view of a huge chunk of map and are extremely useful for approaching people camped on high ground. They also allow you to save launch pads, which means you have increased visibility. I'm not certain about the spawning patterns at the moment, but if I had to guess rifts seem to work like chests and have a designated spawning place with a certain probability of spawning.


My intuition is that it will decrease engagements in the early game, due to incentivising landing on the edge of the map and rifting into circle, but increase midgame engagements as a result of more players alive and increased mobility. This seems to address a lot of peoples' concerns regarding the dead midgame running simulator problem.

And the fact that Rocket and Grenade Lauchers are able to take down dozens of platforms at once is pretty annoying. I feel like C4 should always detonate at the same time, there shouldn't be a slight delay between them. And clingers shouldn't detonate if the wall it's been placed on has been destroyed.

Perhaps reducing the spread on them, but also reducing the firerate or damage slightly would make them more skillful.

The last couple weeks I have not enjoyed playing this game with all these changes.

Some of you may not agree and I'm willing to have a civil discussion about whatever you guys want in the comment section.

To start off, this game was fun because of how fast paced it was, and being able to out skill someone with building and hitting them with shotgun shots was what made me love this game. Now the game has slowed down so much with all the changes to weapons and building. 

1. Epic has been nerfing fun aggressive play since their first damage nerf of the shotguns. In the most recent patch they've removed the ability to use two shotguns, which means everyone is forced to use the shotgun and smg meta. If their goal was to diversify the weapons we could use then this change should not have been added. Before this patch double shotgun was viable and shotgun smg was viable, but now its shit. Running an smg over a second shotgun means less burst damage, and it will take longer to kill leaving you open for more damage from 3rd parties or enemy teammates. 
2. Ever since they nerfed damage again on the shotguns at the end of season 4, it is incredibly rare to hit over 100 damage shots, even point blank. The point of shotguns is to have something that is strong and can deliver a devastating blow point blank, but now we just have tac shotguns and pumps tickling for just over 50 damage
3. Mid game is horrible due to no one wanting to play aggressive anymore. Everyone is waiting to pinch a team that fights. If you initiate a fight mid game you best bet you are going to get 3rd partied.
4. Late game, The last two weeks late game has been fucking a pain in the ass in duos and squads. Everyone hides in a fort now with splodes and their miniguns just raining down, because that is the easiest way to with the state of the current guns.
5. If you are outnumbered, you are dead. I used to be able to solo duos, solo squads pretty decently, but it is nearly impossible to clutch with someone just spam smg or minigun shooting all of your buildings or splodes coming at you breaking every single wall you place down, and of course not being able to kill someone with a shotgun with 2/3 shots, instead I somehow have to use a shotgun and take an extra 3 seconds to spray my smg at them, all while being exposed to the rest of the team.

If any of the points seem unclear, that is because I kind of just typed them really fast. I will reply to every comment and go into more detail on my current thoughts. 

If this meta persists I cannot see myself playing past season 5, which is unfortunate because of all the time I put into becoming good at this game.",FortniteCompetitive

It was a different way of playing that a lot of games didn't really have. It's extremely rare for shotguns to be such a foundational piece of the meta in shooters. The last time a shotgun had this much pull was the akimbo models from MW2. 

I'd honestly still play double shotguns even if it did 60 dmg a shot across the board. The sound, the very quick shots, the gameplay you needed to use to properly utilize them was interesting and rarely done in a game. Now it's just another spray and pray shooter, a hold-left-click frenzy. 

Double shotties was a high risk high reward playstyle. You miss one shot and you're getting lazered by a SMG. I think the nerfs they put in place minus some, like the build delay, were warranted but taking out the ability to do it entirely is absurd. 

Double shotguns was like a curse. You had to be an above average builder to even utilize it because you had to get in close. It sucks because I would've really liked to play with double shotguns now that their spread is different, even if it did horrible damage.

I think pumps should go back to being 1 shots to the head. As of now pumps are completely useless and are basically burst rifle tier weapons. But I guess I'll move onto the SMG/splodes meta like every other shooter has.",FortniteCompetitive

Nice tournament,"Reading this reddit and various chats I saw a TON of people bashing this 1v1 tournament FNProleague hosted and I wanted to share my opinion.  Fortnites competitive scene has been strangled by the lack of real spectating and lack of custom games.  With playgrounds out we finally have the tools to make some very janky tournaments and thats what this is.  Could it have better rules? sure, but if you ask 10 people what they think the best tournament format would be you'd get 10 different answers.  We should be happy they are putting on a tournament because thats how a competitive scene evolves.  This games competitive scene so far hasn't really had any support from epic, there isn't a standardized ruleset for competitive play unless you just play the standard game.  Instead of insulting them just give them good feedback and tell them what they want to see and then the next tournament, whether it's hosted by FNProleague or not, will have a ruleset that more closely resembles what you want because tournament organizers will read feedback, especially this early in.

I think most people wanted something that looked like what most of the teams (faze tsm liquid etc) were practicing so my suggestion would be to move in that direction and away from anything that promotes camping/ghost peeking.

I feel like I have enough experience in this game to talk about this and despite that it might be a hard to swallow pill, remember that K/D doesn't really matter.  
A month ago I was mostly playing for wins and easily win a couple of games in a row, but my avg kills per winning game was usually less than 10.  
Yes, in my opinion winning in this game is extremely easy. As you can see by my season 4 stats in duo when I was still playing ""seriously"", 52.40&amp;#37; win rate out of 210 matches.  


My win rate mid season 3 to beginning of season 4 was usually above 60-65&amp;#37; in solo and duos. My K/D was rarely below 10 but if I compare the player I was then with the player I am now I would easily stomp my self in a 1vs1 against my older form.  


The reason my stats are so ""low"" now is because I only land tilted on the same spot (top of trump tower) and I never win a game with less than 10 kills. This obviously makes winning a lot more RNG and harder, but at the same time, by often being in very stressful and hard to win situations I feel like I'm improving a lot more and has changed my mentality for the better as well.  


Once you learn how to do it, winning games is very easy, playing the circle and always putting yourself in a good situation by using natural high ground, avoid unnecesary fights and survive till the end game so your chances of winning are higher. But you won't improve forever or that faster.

So what I'm trying to say here is don't be fooled and think someone is a ""god"" when he has 10-15K/D and at the same time don't judge a player by only having 3-4K/D, they might have very different playstyles and sometimes the player with lower K/D might actually be the better one.  


Good luck with your games! :)  


PS: obviously K/D does matter when someone has like 0.18 K/D, that's not being aggressive, that's being trash :P

So 1v1s are a great way to improve your building/weapon skills for when you encounter a solo player in a real match, however, it doesn't do much justice for multi-player skirmishes especially due to the non-usage of splode in 1v1s which is literally on the top of the current meta right now. With this I thought of a way players can practice in playground with an accurate representation of in-game situations.

This scrim exercise is best done with 3-4 people. The premise is to have everybody fall at the same time from named location to named location throughout the duration of the game. Players will each land at their own building and then fight it out until 1 person is alive in that location. Players who have been eliminated will land outside the location on respawn and wait until the skirmish has concluded and then all 4 players will build a suicide ramp together and all jump at the same time so that everybody respawns at the same time. This is when you land at the next location.

Start by doing a **Pleasant Park** battle and then do a **Tilted Towers** battle and then a **Greasy Grove** battle and so on and so forth.

**This scrim exercise has no rules, all weapons and utilities are allowed.** This will give players better practice for when they are in a real match. Materials wont be an issue due to the multiplied material gain so all you really have to do is knock down a couple of walls.

This is a pretty simple idea and I'm sure someone has thought of it, I just  wanted to share it because, in my opinion, it sounds much more beneficial than 1v1s.",FortniteCompetitive

For me it's always been a get on and play for fun with friends, even the ones on console. I always play with people who I find enjoyable to talk to but 9/10 times they are significantly worse so we don't do as well as we could, but it doesn't matter to me.

So really, people who are already up there. I'm looking at you people with streams getting more than 7 or 8 viewers, or people with those good 5+ KDs and high win rates. Is it worth it? What do you get out of playing at a high level and/or streaming to a larger audience?

I tried setting up with a 1x1 quickly and right as I did he shot out my ramp, dropping me onto his, slightly below him. 

He immediately placed a floor between him and I, so directly above my head and he was standing on it. Before I could even react, while still walking above me, he managed to place a trap on the bottom of floor piece between us. So the trap was under the floor, facing down towards my head. I paused a bit because I have no idea how he pulled it off, started to shoot the trap and then died when it triggered. 

Missed recording it through the xbox snapshot, and my replays are screwed (anytime I try to watch or save a replay, it gets corrupted and removed from my list) so I have no record of this happening but I'm just curious to find out if anyone else has witnessed this or may be aware of some exploit that allows this to happen.

Yes using C4 and drum guns and heavy shotguns are fun and can get you the win but if you’re trying to become a better player. They create bad habits and if you start to rely on then when they get nerfed you will be in deep shit. 

Don’t get comfortable with a load out. You should always be using and getting better with guns that you aren’t good with so that you’re a more versatile player. 

If you start an engagement meaning you get the first shot on somebody don’t take an hour to use first shot accuracy your shoot a few shots in a burst motion and push. 

If you’re in a build fight and get highground don’t 50/50 a player. 50/50 is where you drop on a player in a box and get into a shotty fight. The problem with this is that nobody knows who’s shots will do more damage or better spread so if you have high ground you’re safer off taking peek shots.

If you’re in an AR fight don’t shoot more than 1-2 shots before crouching again. Against a good player you’ll get sniped or lasered for peeking too long.

Learn advanced building techniques more are always being found and you don’t wanna fall behind but not only that if you get in a build fight and lose high ground and the opponent above you is consistently keeping it unless they mess up you’ll be screwed if you know how to pyramid somebody or pyramid ramp edit. 

Stats Don’t Matter. No good players or teams worry about stats and if you’re looking for a team that has a stat req then stay away.

These are things I’ve learned from being in the competitive scene for a fat minute I hope they help you.",FortniteCompetitive

Hear me out, I've seen various people get lasered by this thing, from both long and close range. As someone who rocks the gun 24/7 no matter what, using it feels a tad bit unfair. Much like the double pump before it got rightfully nerfed, catch an enemy even slightly off guard and you could kill them in nearly half a second.

Even in fights where I've been up against people rocking pump/heavy, a green or even a grey SMG burns because of how accurate it is. Shotguns seem stupidly useless at this point, and it feels like SMGs and Drum Guns are now used as replacements. Why not instead fix shotguns and balance them out rather than turn other weapons into shotguns?

And SMGs are essentially rifles too. I've seen lots of people, myself included, drop a SCAR for a blue or green SMG without a moments hesitation. I don't want the Suppressed to become absolute garbage again but does anyone think there's any option to balance meta out?

tl;dr SMGs are essentially shotguns and rifles at this point and it feels weird that one gun has been buffed to the point where it can replace the 2 former best guns in the game. Any opinions on how to balance the game?",FortniteCompetitive

Pumps should have their delays removed (or removed and making it so that you can only use 1 shotgun somehow). Currently, getting double heavies is basically getting a stronger version of double pump and that's mostly because of how fast (and far) they shoot.

Imo, you shouldn't just get lucky to get an absolutely better version of a gun. It would be far fairer for everyone to have pumps with no delays since everyone can reliably grab a pump from the ground, but not everyone would be running heavies. 

Either that, or heavies get a swap delay lol. I personally hope that it never happens.

* Sometimes an engagement is not worth it, or you should actively try and disengage from a fight.
* If you're being out built for whatever reason, don't keep forcing the fight higher up. You can bait players back down than re-take highground, or just disengage.
* If you have c4 disregard the last statement. The cheesiest kills are when you consistently bait a player higher and higher than go down and c4 everything.
* c4 is broken.
*  Practice your building, but don't over complicate things. 99% of the playerbase, including solid players, can be outbuilt without any advanced building moves. Just learn the bread and butter moves and edits, than make sure you can do them fast and consistently.
* When starting a head to head engagement, build then shoot. Your 40-50 shield damage isn't worth giving up the high ground against a player who didn't try and poke back. 
* If you're in a close quarters fight and miss a shotty shot, just build. Don't double down if you miss an opening shot, just get safe and try again.
* If you think you landed at a semi-popular spot alone, just assume you're wrong. Idk what the hell they did in the past few updates, but people have been magically appearing in the house next to me despite not being visible in the air.
* As soon as you hit the ground your priorities are a gun and ~100 mats. Obviously shields and other stuff are great, but getting atleast 10 walls worth of mats will keep you safe and allow you to win fights against low grounders.
* In the mid/late game, prioritize natural high ground when deciding how to approach circles. 
* Save jump pads and bounce pads when possible. Nothing is worse than having to push a dude with splodes and infinite ammo thats posted up on top of a mountain in the last circles. The movement pads make those pushes way more approachable.
* In the end-game, don't peek for longer than 2-4 bullet bursts. Someone WILL laser you from the bush across the map.
* If you're really try-harding, landing on un-named locations are the way to go. All you really need to win mid game fights or poach people in the POIs is a shotty, an AR/SMG, shields, and mats.
* Traps and bounce pads are absolute game changers when you get comfortable using them mid fight.
* Despite how your map awareness/rotation knowledge, people will do random shit. Never leave a wall open in your 1x1, and if you're peeking a certain angle put up cover walls behind you.
* Sometimes you just gotta go ham. Don't worry about messing up, just focus on outplaying people.

Oh well, got season 3 &amp; 4, &amp; I will be getting 5. 

Played with my irl friend since I first installed this game on PS4. But sometime about week 4 or 5 this season I got bored with playing with him... Mainly because his play style is to treasure chest hunt, run to every circle in the storm, med up when out and keep running to the next circle in hopes of making top 2 and then magically taking out the last team. It works, but it’s boring and it wasn’t improving my skills. 

I tried to say to him “ let’s try and improve our skills and drop at a high traffic POI, get better at battle and then we won’t choke so often” and that was cool with him. We did, a few times, maybe 25 total... but he didn’t get to open a single chest that way and usually died nearly right away. I tired to help him but he just kept blaming me for his mistakes. He shoulda built lol!

After this I wasn’t “allowed” to pick drop spots anymore and he would always smack talk me asking “how many wins do you have solo? Yeah thought so” (FYI at this point he had 6 to my 2 solo wins. Total. All 4 seasons.) If I did speak up about something Or mention a drop spot/ strat he would respond with “is that what reddit told you to do” or “did a streamer do that and now you think you can too?”  And “okay, you’re the pro. Carry me to a win” Really passive aggressively. 

Side note; at this point I’m Starting to think I need new friends IRL. 

When I realized my play style didn’t match with his. I stopped playing with him and focused on my play style and getting better. I died a lot. But in the last 5 weeks of this season. I jumped from 2 solo wins total, up To 10 solo wins this season alone! I also managed to not only catch up to my “buddy” in kills, but surpassed him by hundreds of kills. I’m not saying I went pro... but increased my k/d avg from .19 to .64 and increase my win % from .25 to 1%. And the BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT??? I spend 100% less time hiding in trees and bushes just waiting to “see where the next circle is”. I regularly place top 10 and my kills range from 2-7 per game and it’s so much more exciting that way! 

I have 2 questions... Since I played so extremely passive for so so long... should I start a new account? Or keep pushing for better stats? 

AND

Is there anybody on PS4 - NAW. Who would be willing to show me or take me through a few games of high level play? I mainly play solo now and because of that all I have is replay to go off of to improve and critique myself, but it would be great to have a mentor of some sort to point out the things I’m not aware of... I don’t know what I don’t know. You know what I mean?

I want to get competitive but I feel like if people look at my stats they’ll just think I’m trash and never take me seriously. 

TLDR: I ditched my irl friend, to get better, I did and now I am wondering about starting an new account to show more accurate stats or keep mine and show how much I improved. And also seeking a guru/ mentor to help / advice. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

The zone continues to move in their favor and we're left with having to try to reclaim high ground which is near impossible with the explosives they have. And every single time, the team that won only killed us for the entire game - they previously had 0 kills before then. Is it just me or does it seem like this is way more common now? And if so, any suggestions on retaking high ground when the other teams on a hill and has high ground?

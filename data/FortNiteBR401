If we win *that* game, give us a **Golden Ticket** which allows us to enter ""legendary matches"" possibly held at a certain time (might be necessary due to lower player counts). Normal games would be the same, and then you could enter sweat-fest matches with silver tickets. It would raise the hype of a specific match, and be much more exciting than just lame SBMM. As well, it would be in the spirit of BR completely and be widely praised by all. It would give noobs something to strive for, and good players something to be satisfied by. It would raise hype for the game to extreme levels.

with that in mind, i’ve written a guide to getting your first fortnite win. obviously, people can and often do win games even if they break some of the rules i’ll list. and obviously, people can and often do lose games even if they follow all of the rules i’ll list. i’m also going to be recommending some strategies that many players will think of as boring or somehow dishonorable.

all of these criticisms might be valid; even so, in my experience, the method i'll set out is the most reliable, although still far from guaranteed, way to win a game.

* i’m not an elite fortnite player by any means, but i’m decent — i have a ~10% winrate, a ~2.5 kdr, and getting close to 200 wins total.



1. drop in the right place.

	don’t drop in a place that’s too high-population. usually, the highest-pop places are tilted, retail, pleasant, and greasy. after that come areas like salty, snobby, anarchy, and fatal, which typically draw a good number of people, and are sometimes packed, even though they’re occasionally empty.

	but also don’t drop in a place that’s too low-loot. coastal and mountain areas far from any landmarks are not going to reliably contain enough chests and loot spawns to fully outfit you. there are even landmark areas that are also low-loot: moisty, dusty, tomato, wailing, and the racetrack are the worst in this respect.

	the best places to go are small, often unnamed areas at a safe distance from major landmarks but not out in some empty corner of the map. flush, junk, haunted, and lonely are often good. the jail is good. the two small unnamed areas surrounding flush factory are good. the constellation of houses in the northeast quadrant are good. the quadrangle between retail, salty, fatal, and the jail is good.

	don’t drop in any place that’s too close to the battle bus’ flight path, especially the places within a few units of the starting or ending point of the path.

	all else equal, drop closer to the center of the map; you won’t have to run to the center of the map.



2. find the right loot.

	you absolutely need: an assault rifle, a shotgun, at least half shield, an item for health recovery, an item for shield recovery, and at least 500 resources. don’t ever pause to camp until you’ve hit this minimum.

	if you have a blue/purple/gold assault rifle, a green pump or blue/purple tac, full shield, a medkit, either at least one shield potion or a stack of three or more minis, and at least 850 resources, then you should stop looting. the chances that you’ll die while wandering around looking for more stuff on a map that’s already mostly looted are much higher than the chances that you’ll find loot better than what you already have.



3. camp whenever you can, and move only when you must.

	get over any shame you might have about camping.

	once you’ve gotten decent loot, don’t move any further until you absolutely have to. if you’re already inside the white circle, stay there. when you have to move to the next white circle, wait to do so as long as you can without subjecting yourself to storm damage; ie, try to time things so that you’ll enter the white circle at pretty much exactly the moment where the storm reaches it.

	stay in an inconspicuous place. preferably, go inside of a building or other shelter that has visibly already been looted, with open doors and damaged walls. hide behind stairs. it’s better to do this than to build a fort for yourself, since enemies will tend to assume that a fort has someone inside, whereas they will assume that a looted building is empty. 

	when you move to the new circle, try to enter it from the side the fewest people will come from. this will typically be the side closest to the edge of the map.

	when you move to the circle, stay at a safe distance, preferably a grid unit or more, from any high-population areas.

	resist any temptation you might have to go out and fight because you’re bored sitting still.

5. don’t fight unless necessary, and fight conservatively when you do.

	if a player didn’t see you, and isn’t coming towards you, let them go on their way.

	the moment a fight starts, build cover for yourself, especially if you’re not sure yet where the other player is.

	build upwards to maintain the high ground. if somebody’s trying to ramp over you, try to ramp upwards over their ramp before they can make it there.

	whenever possible, fight by means of peek-shots.

	if someone starts a fight with you, and it’s going badly, try to build cover around yourself and use some of your recovery items.

	if someone starts a fight with you, and it’s going very badly, and you have a jump pad, just jump out of there. but be wary of being shot in the sky or followed.



6. go for supply drops unless others are going for or camping over them.

	this may sound odd, because so far my advice has been to avoid risks. but the potential value of the items from a supply drop is so massive that it outweighs the dangers. in particular, getting a gold rocket launcher raises your odds of winning so massively that it’s well worth risking your neck to get it.



7. in the top ten, be passive, but not too passive.

	often enough, your enemies in the top ten will kill one another for you if you let them. don’t do anything to attract attention to yourself and away from your other rivals.

	if others are fighting, don’t interrupt them. but after their fight is over, you should attack immediately, unless there are third parties to worry about; if you delay, you’ll only give them a chance to get back health and shield, rez their squadmates, reload their weapons, etc.

	don’t build a massive base at the center or highest point of the remaining area. one exception: if there’s a tall mountain in the area, try to be the first person there, since if you let someone else fortify it first it will be very difficult to kick them out.

	if you have a rocket launcher, and you’re fighting at medium to close range — use it!",FortNiteBR

There are pickaxes that cost the same or just about the same as a skin, and emotes that cost 500 Vbucks which equals about $5. 

I love the game and am all for throwing in a couple bucks here and there to support it, but I just can't bring myself to spend $20-$25 for a skin and an emote.

Skill based matchmaking has no place in here. You know why winning is so satisfying? Because you can look at that last black knight you killed and wonder just how many wins he had. He could have been the 1# player world wide, and you killed him. Or the learning experience that is landing as a new person and instantly getting mowed down. Over, and over, until finally you learn something. You get your first kill, suddenly you aren't fodder. You can fight back. It's not any easier, you are better. THIS IS IMPORTANT! The appeal of this game is the drive to improve, and adding skill based matchmaking destroys that.

I've only been playing for about 2 weeks... Normally I play and my daughter spots enemies for me. She’s really good at seeing these c guys sneaking up on me. Well tonight, my six year old girl says she wants to play. My personal strategy is to usually load up on guns and then sneak around and hide in bushes till the final part of the game. I let everyone else kill each other to thin the herd. So when she picks up the controller and clumsily parachutes into the island I think, ok... this’ll last 30 seconds and I’ll play again. She picks up a gun in the first house she comes across. (We are down to 90 players left) And sneaks across to another house and just waits. (70...65...50) She sneaks from house to house till she is out of salty springs, (45 players left) and then sneaks from bush to bush. Just watching gun battles from afar. Now she stops just outside of Dusty Depot with about 5 of the 15 players left battling it out on the top.  She watches these guys smoke each other and as the circle closes in, she sneaks into the depot and gets a close up view of the final rocket battle. We are all FREAKING OUT. She is top 5. ON HER FIRST GAME EVER. She is freaking out. Afraid to move because yes, there’s no way she is gonna ACTUALLY WIN the first match she ever plays, AT SIX YEARS OLD.  Long story short. She got second place. SECOND!!! I’ve never gotten second place in a solo battle! We were flipping out! It was amazing to see.",FortNiteBR

Instead of each character model being random each time you start up a new game, each player model could represent a certain class giving that character a slight advantage in a certain area of the game. Some Examples: 

Jonesy – Lands with 25 shield off the battle bus so he could take a little bit more damage in initial fights after landing 

Nomad – Destroys materials 25% faster making him quicker at collecting building materials and breaking down walls 

Hawk – Has a 25% increase in accuracy on all guns he uses  

Banshee – Takes 25% less damage when caught in the storm increasing survivability when trying to make it to the next safe zone  

Wildcat – Has 25% increased movement speed making her more agile when running across the map  

Mari – is 25% quieter when walking, generating  almost the same amount of noise as crouch walking  

I think these additions would be great at adding to the meta of the game. Also, it would give a purpose to the different character models outside of just cosmetics (this includes finally being able to pick M/F, race, etc. for your character).

If this skin is added the pickaxe could be a pair brush. And if you have ever watched Bob Ross before than you know that when he cleans his paintbrush he “beats the devil out of it”. This would be the sound of the pickaxe.

The skin would be the regular Bob Ross kind of look. I haven’t really decided what colors he would be wearing, but he would definitely have his famous hair.

And the last idea I have is an emote/voice line. I know voice lines are not really in the game right now but it would be cool to have s voice line for Bob Ross.  I was thinking for the emote you oils paint a picture for 2 seconds. While in this emote your character Bob Ross would say, “no mistakes just happy little ancients” you could use this after you kill someone to BM or congratulate them. And another voice line could be when you die. When you die the game would say the same quote as the emote to anyone around you.

93,Deadzors,1518193636,7wekel,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7wekel/shotgun_balance_discussion_with_suggestion/,20,Shotgun Balance Discussion with Suggestion,"I know that many of us have different opinions for how shotguns should be balanced so I'd like to get a discussion going and get other players feedback. I'd like to focus on 2 points, listed below, and give my own suggestion as well as hear about some of yours.


**The main 2 points of discussion:** 

 * 1.) Is Double Pumping an Exploit and should it be removed/limited?

 * 2.) Should players be able to One-Shot kill another player with full health/shield with Pump/Any shotgun?

**The 1st point: Double Pump**

Some players like to argued that it's fair since it requires 2 weapon slots. And another argument is that it takes a bit of skill based on fast weapon swapping in the heat of the battle. 

Currently, there are 2 types of shotguns which are completely opposite in design. One has low damage/range with a high rate of fire(Tactical) and the other has high damage/range with a slow rate of fire(Pump). However, outside of the slots/skill arguments, the Double Pump out performs the Tactical shotguns across the board thus negating any preference/trade-off. 

**My Opinion:** 
It's doesn't seem right that we can skip the time between shots(Rate of Fire) by changing weapons then changing back. All weapons should have there RoF preserved once you return to that weapon. Whether this means waiting on your bolt action to reload or the time it takes to ""pump"" your next round into your shotgun. 

**My Suggestion:** 
""Pumping"" between shots fired should be tied to an animation and the next round simply can't fire until that animation is complete. And interrupting your ""pumping"" action should work just like interrupting your reload. 

Some of your opinions may vary, and to each their own, but I'm open to hear other thoughts on the matter.

**The 2nd point: One-Shot Shotguns**

The latest 2 shooting test are leaning towards removing the One-Shot ability based on the critical damage nerfs to shotguns. This feels similar to a TTK(time to kill) argument with many players standing on each side.

**My Opinion:** 
I could go either way on this one and would just adapt my play style accordingly. However, I do feel that such a powerful weapon shouldn't be as common as grey and green items which leads me to my next suggestion.

**My Suggestion:**

1.) Keep Tactical Shotguns as they are and use them as a starting point for balancing the other shotguns.

2.) Make all weapons have 200% critical damage(basically double damage). 

3.) Change the rarity of Pump shotguns to Epic and Legendary rarities.

* The Epic variant will stay at 90 base damage

* The Legendary variant will have 100 base damage(The Only One-Shot Shotgun)

4.) Introduce the Double Barrel Shotgun as Common(grey) and Uncommon(green) varieties. Both barrels can be fired as fast as you can pull the trigger but will have long reload time.
    
* The Common variant will do 60 base damage
    
* The Uncommon variant will do 67 base damage

**Explanation:**

My 1st intention is to make only 1 shotgun variant in the game that can kill any player with full health/shield with one head shot. I wanted this gun to be super rare to limit it's power during the early stages of the match.

With the change to Pump Shotgun rarities, I only felt it necessary to replace the Common/Uncommon shotgun with a weaker, Double Barrel version. You can imagine all of the different critical and non critical combination of the Double Barrel for each variant and all the different total damage potential per clip. It could even be equipped in 2+ slots but I still don't think it would be nearly as powerful as the current Double Pump. I'm open for feedback on the damage values and what might be a better balance/fit, it's still a W.I.P. for me.

Another flip-flop of this idea is to just nerf pumps like shooting test modes but introduce the Double Barrel as the Epic/Legendary version with the potential to One-Shot full health/shield players. The main purpose of my idea is to find a compromise for the One-Shot Shotgun and if they are to exist, they shouldn't be grey and green rarities.

**In Conclusion:**

Epic are attempting to adjust balance shotguns along with other weapons as indicated with their latest shooting test, so what better time to hear the communities thoughts. And I thought it was better if I made some suggestions to get things started but maybe my ideas are way off. What are your thoughts on Shotgun? I'm always interested in hearing a detailed/nuanced response from you guys and some of your thoughts/opinions/suggestions.",FortNiteBR

I appreciate you trying to encourage skillful gameplay without RNG, but you haven't done it right. This is the only thing keeping me from playing this...

The current meta makes it so semi-sniping is way too op around 50metres, compared to normal Fortnite...

And that makes it uncomfortable trying to shoot. in my 2 games I got to play, I already noticed that the best tactic to combat snipers is to ADS&gt;SHOOT&gt;UNADS&gt;CHANGE POSITION&gt;REPEAT.. this combined with crouching behind cover makes the game awkward and sorry to say ""badly designed"".. Don't keep it like this, if you think you've received enough good feedback. rework it a bit more...

TLDR: it's not good or perfect because the way it's made. And read the above for why.

yeh, that's my take on it. English is not my native language... :c

The worst is when you get first to the chest only to have someone take the weapon from behind!

I don't mind dying quickly if I have a weapon as its then a ""fair"" fight.

I think it would also help new players a little.

it would make the initial battles for the good loot more meaningful.

The weapon would just be a common Pistol with 1 mag.

Building creates the skill gap and gives players the opportunity to outplay their opponents whether they are out on the open or hiding in a bush, whereas in games such as H1Z1 and PUBG, if you are caught in the open (running to the storm perhaps) you are pretty much fucked.

But with this idea, building is still slower than on PC. But what about this:

There is no need to enter building mode by pressing O.
A wall ist selected by pressing R1.
Stairs are selected by pressing L1.
By pressing R1 again, you can switch between Walls and Floors.
By pressing L1 again, you can switch between Stairs and Roofs.
To actually build a piece, you press R2 just as it is right now.
To quit building mode without building something, you use O.
Materials can be circled with L2.

The only downside to this is that L1 and R1 can't be used for changing weapons anymore. Still i think building quickly is more important than switching weapons quickly. Changing weapons is done by triangle, just as in the default scheme.

Because obviously you focussed on the countries that bought the most skins. Just like you did with the selling tiers. Why isnt that just based on rank? Please dont focus too much on making bank. Normal people cant get on every day to do challenges for tiers and i hate being forced to play a certain gamemode or use a weapon i dont like.
If you want to make bank you are doing it wrong too. People are asking for skins left and right and you dont deliver. Ninja tells you about the plunja and you do it. We want more skins so people dont have the same skin and its actually special. Also if you want to make bank to fix your servers etc etc why dont you sell a bit of room @ the island we pass with the bus ; and use that for advertising. You are the biggest game out there.

These people will **not** be full moderators. You will obtain moderator status but not will full permissions (at least in the beginning).

# Who the heck are you?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm one of your resident mods. Most of you probably don't know me, unless I've removed your posts (sorry not sorry). I haven't been the most active since helping launch and maintain this subreddit in the first couple months. However, I wish to come back better than ever. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To help ease the burden and craze of improving things, I've decided it's necessary to bring on some new talent to the team. I noticed many applicants of the moderator recruitment previously had computer science backgrounds, so you know the feeling of working alone.

# Changes Currently in Discussion

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've seen some great suggestions, and these are some that are currently on the table for everyone to comment on. Feel free to suggest more things, but keep in mind we can't please everyone, there are almost 200k of us!

## Suggestions

* Event Banners &amp; Themes (Already in talks with Epic Games for art assets)
* Holiday Themes (Even stuff like Mother's Day, April Fool's Day, etc.)
* Themed Snoos &amp; Snoo Contests (The little dude in the top left)
* Landing Spot of the Day (Decide on where to incorporate)

#How can I be helpful?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Currently looking to fill two positions (not necessarily by only two people though). If you think you'd be good at any of the things below, please, apply! Please remember these positions ARE NOT MODERATION (although they could become that)!

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also please report any bugs or issues you have with the current subreddit design. Messaging me directly at /u/MCiLuZiioNz or through the ""Message the Moderators"" link will work.

#CSS/Design

##Description

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You might have noticed the CSS on the subreddit hasn't changed much lately (no longer true). That's because we planned a complete overhaul but never got around to it because of the time required. If you have CSS experience and are somewhat keen on design (lol I'm not), then apply.

##Desired Traits

* CSS experience **(Required)**
* Experience in a graphics program like Photoshop
* Like the color purple
* Knows how to use GitHub and Git tools

## [Apply](https://goo.gl/forms/BLwBvNswBOOAaTrc2)

---

# Programmer

## Description

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Help develop useful tools for the subreddit moderation team and potentially users as well. Such tools might include a Reddit moderation bot, Reddit &lt;-&gt; Discord integration for moderators, and post statistics tracking. Currently the main language in use is Python, so knowledge of the language would be useful. You don't have to know Python, as anyone who's programmed long enough, moving to a language is generally just syntax.

## Desired Traits

* Some proficiency in programming (preferably Python) **(Required)**
* Knows how to use GitHub and Git tools
* Experience using Reddit API (PRAW or other library)
* Experience using the Discord API (discord.py or other library)
* Desire to see the community grow
* Doesn't think HTML is programming

## [Apply](https://goo.gl/forms/N6prWR6T6xf2IaKp1)

---

# What do I get out of it?
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We will love you long time, and the community will appreciate it. You'll be somewhat of a junior moderator in the beginning while doing other things (we could always use the help actually moderating too). You also get to join our (super secret) Discord chats about how we hate how much you all break the rules :\^). You'll also have the satisfaction of knowing you help one of the fastest growing Reddit communities. Please remember, these positions do **NOT** grant you full moderator status (although you may end up in our good books).

---

If you can submit any previous experience to either of these positions, it will help your chances significantly. Regardless, thanks for being a great community!

I was just curious to see what your win rates are at currently, preferably for solos because that shows individual skill and not team skill. Feel free to post all 3 though, or include kills if you want to, as well as any other relevant info. 

For those unsure win rate is total wins divided by matches played multiplied by 100. 

I've got 48 solo wins out of around 600 games, think it's around 620 now, and 1100 kills. So that's around an 8% win rate.

 If all factors are true then average win rate should be around the 1% mark for the entire player base, but factoring in that games often start with &lt;100 players it will be higher. 

My duos and squads arent so pretty. I've only got 1 duo win out of 20 games, and the 1 win was probably the only time i actually played with a friend and not a random duo. Squads are even worse, 10 wins out of 300 games if i remember correctly, will have to check that one. But i play a lot of solo squad, i started that a while ago once i started getting better at the game for more intense practice and quite like it sometimes, think 6 or 7 of those wins were solo games, i do play with a few friends from time to time but not very often becase we're usually on at different times unfortunately, time zone differences suck sometimes.

Maybe i should add that i play on PS4. I recently got a PC too, so i'm trying to get used to movement + shooting, but that's a work in progress. 

Curious to hear how you guys are doing!

There's been an awful lot of shotgun discussion lately. You're probably sick of it, but until happy changes are made, we need to explore all possibilities. To that end, I offer a critical point: the pump's DAMAGE is not the biggest problem, its RANGE is. 

It sucks hickory nuts having my shield stripped by some swagabond jumping and hip-firing from 10-15 feet away. ~15 feet should be prime Assault Rifle range, but somehow... it isn't. This clip highlights the problem (all credit to Dakotaz): https://clips.twitch.tv/StylishTriumphantBatTBTacoRight

The damage over range is utterly insane, not the damage itself. The damage over distance of the FIRST TWO SHOTS are the problem, not the last two. Imagine if Dakotaz had to fire an AR during the first two seconds because of the distance. His opponent probably wouldn't be down 110hp in a flash. Hell, he'd probably make a different play altogether (unless he knew the opponent was terrible).

Here's an obligatory clip of me flipping out after a day of eating pump lead (LOUD &amp; WHINY WARNING): https://clips.twitch.tv/TentativeRespectfulRatSoBayed - Note that I'm using dual pumps because they're OP, they fit my aggressive style, and I got tired of fighting against the obvious meta. It's like my grand pappy used to say, ""If you can't beat em', pump em'.""

To be clear, I am not anti-shotgun. We NEED the shotgun archetype to provide powerful, short-range measures -- whether they're aggressive or defensive. Aggressively, if I'm risking my biscuit to push into someone's grill, and I kitted to make it work, I'd like to be compensated. Similarly, in a defensive context, if a squad is rushing me 1 by 1, you bet your ass I want to pop from behind cover and make them pay. I'll fully admit, the pump's dmg values are not perfect. They can do with mild tuning. But we need to be careful so as not to nerf the Tactical shotty into oblivion, which already has wider spread. I agree with something someone wrote in another thread: the shooting test dropping crit damage to 200% (or even around 215%-225%) might be perfect. I wouldn't even mind if the pump kept its damage over range WHILE AIMING DOWN THE SIGHT. I think that adequately deals with the hyper mobility of the pump at range.

In closing, nobody should need to carry two shotguns in order to compete at a medium distance. Epic is fully aware of damage fall-off and distancing issues for the 4X AR. Just look at how insanely they've tweaked it in this shooting test. Suddenly hitscan and suddenly NO damage fall-off? But that's why we call it a test. I'd like to see similar measures applied to the pump shotty.

Let's keep this game we love evolving, not crawling back into the soup.",FortNiteBR

With these challenges, not only are you not guaranteed to even contribute to the goal by the end of each game, but every time you get to the final 25 players, generally games become a lot longer in their total time.

I think the thing that separated FN from games like PUBG was the fact that you could count on good smooth servers but now that this is gone a lot of my friends have made the switch.

Crossbow:

-Is silent

-Has range

-Infinite ammo

-5 rounds

-Fires fairly quick

-Does some really strong headshot damage

-Blue rarity

Im surprised at both the fire rate and ammo capacity (thought it would need a longer reload after every shot fired)


Is this not encroaching on the Bolt sniper and Semi Auto rifle’s territory? Seems to have the advantage too because if its silent, there’s no risk of players hearing a shot and building cover, or giving away your position.",FortNiteBR

But I don't think any gun in this game should have infinite ammo (assuming no melee weapons). During early game fights, ammo is huge and someone with a crossbow is going to have a clear advantage over almost anyone. I get the idea behind the ammo feature as a buff to balance it against the more powerful bolt, but maybe instead of ""infinite"" it can use 2 Wood per shot. Or whatever number ends up being balanced. Wood is easy to get, so practically infinite, but at least you have to do something in order to get the ammo. It's also something that players towards the end of the game have hundreds of. So it will feel infinite. Any thoughts?",FortNiteBR

The two biggest problems that have been well documented are: 1) The lack of any noticible penalty for shooting while moving gives an unfair advantage to moving players (if a standing still player and jumping player are in a gun fight and both land perfect shots the jumping player will win more often than not). 2) The damage variation is massive and seems completely random. 

I think there are a couple ways to address this:

1) If a player is moving increase the spread by 1.5x and jumping by 2x with a .5 second return time. (Edit: I meant accuracy not size of pellet spread)

2) Reduce the shotgun RNG by adding bullet physics with a fixed/consistent pattern

OR

by creating tiers in the reticle (think of the Target logo) If your Target is in the center you get 50% damage, second tier 35%, third 15%. However if your target fills all tiers (super close range) you get 100% damage every time. ",FortNiteBR

I have 13 year old twins that love Fortnite. It is by far, their favorite game. They each get 7 hours of video game time a week and we have 1 tv, so I pretty much have 14 hours of that game on in the background a week. 

I get into the game with them. I'm really challenged when it comes to video games. I haven't played a console game pretty much since I was in high school when Super Mario 2 came out. My kids are so into Fortnite though, and I've seen them play a lot, so I figured what the heck, I want to play.

First thing I learned is I am super rusty at video games. There are way more buttons to worry about nowadays. I also have arthritis so the controllers nowadays suck in terms of button pushing. My aim is terrible. I definitely played like the newest of the newbs.

However, I got super lucky with circles and I had good timing for when to do things (like when to run, where to run to) and in my very first time playing, I got to 3rd place. My kids couldn't believe it. That's the farthest either of them have gotten on singles (they mostly play duos with their friends), and they couldn't believe their old mom who never plays video games got 3rd on her first try.

Simply make the pump shotgun a single shot gun, but have the pump action be the reload and the reload time be about 1 second or whatever the delay is. 
So if someone has two pumps they can’t keep swapping them to cancel out the delay because when they fire they are forced to reload first.

The only problem is you can still do a fast double pump if both of the guns are preloaded. Or, if you have 4 shotguns all loaded you could switch to each of them in rapid succession like you would a sniper.
Even though you would still technically have fast pumps, would be directly relate to how many you have. 

The alternative method is way more complex. It would require the code to know that the person just fired their shotgun and when stored away keep that information such that the delay remains constant.
Or you could code it such that if someone has multiple pumps in their inventory add a firing delay when switching to a new one after just firing the other.

Idk I’m just throwing out ideas

Edit: I’m completely open to opinions. Im not saying double pumping would be flat out removed, just nerfed.

This could be used to either build some quick cover for you, trap the enemy if you throw it on them (they then have to break their way out), or another use I haven't thought of.

Theyre near useless. Now i dont know if this was an attempt to nerf double pump. But if it was i and many other players will tell you its not gonna work. The fact the tactical is literally useless now is only gonna promote double pumping more.
And the 100% accuracy idea is only gonna slow the game down and promote camping. People can just peak hit a shot, crouch and then rinse and repeat. 
So not only did they kill the shotguns with the nerf they made it harder to rush people by taking a whole gun out of the game. All you have to do to counter double pump or any shotgun variation is build.
Even if you wanna nerf double pump, fine. But dont get rid of the shotguns completely to do so. 
And to the poeple who say the nerf on shogtgun is justified becuase ""the shotgun is OP"" its not. Just because you get one tapped and you cant one tap back doesnt mean its broken.
The reason the pump is so lethal up close is simply because its a shotgun. Put double pump aside for a second and look at a single pump. 
It does a lot of damage but it shoots slow, the green pumps dps 66.5 compared to the purple tacs dps which is 111.
Look at the deagle in CS poeple dont say it should be nerfed because you can be one tapped with it, they see that its a large caliber handgun and rock with it.
Just like a shotgun shell to the face 5 feet away isnt gonna tickle.
I saw a reddit user (sick_stuff1) say this ""it is close combat where you can get outplayed the hardest. 
the high skilled mofo sitting 80m away with an ar isn't as threating as the high skilled mofo with his shotgun building walls around you.""
Which is true and thats why you see all these casual low level; players complaining about shotguns becuse they cant one tap or cant defend against shtoguns.
Make the pumps have to pump again even if you switch but dont nerf the shotgun damage. And make it so if youre crouched and stand you lose your 100% accuarcy. 
And give the mini guns a magazine capacity or an overheat function. Its too overwhelming at times in the end game (in squads at least) when a whole squad can all be laying down fire at you with miniguns.
And they can shoot pretty much forever if they have enough ammo.
To be honest i dont see why they should change the game at all (besides the minigun idea) Its competely fine and playable as it is.
bad players will be bad and complain about things needing to be nerfed, but thats how it is in every game.",FortNiteBR

This would help with navigating parts of the map without giving players independent transportation such as cars, trucks, etc. It would help with large treks and add some structured travel that is fair across the board. 

A train station (Rusty Railroad?) could be a named location that the train would stop at during every loop completion. The train could stop briefly, but resume after a set time every (X) seconds/minutes. The train would consist of train cars with various boxes, containers, rooms, etc. that players could destroy or build on similar to structures found in the current game. 

Large bridges would allow the train to travel between any hills/mountains, too. The train itself could not be destroyed, nor impeded, along with the train cars. Players could be disallowed from building directly on the rail system and any structures built in front of the train/cars would be destroyed. 

The train would move at a speed slightly faster than running pace and would be a cool addition that isn’t just a new location.

I feel like it is time I discuss my feelings about Fortnite. Though some may not care, I truly believe I have strong points. Please hear me out. 

I want to start off by saying I l am getting tired. So tired of the game, BUT I don't want to be tired of it. It is such a refreshing game and a beautiful one on top of that. The only problem is that we are secretly neglecting it. 

Let's talk about bugs and patches, and other updates: 

I love how hard working the developers are. I truly do but I think we should take a step back and figure out the old problems before we create new ones. What I mean by that, is that we need to fix the bugs before adding more content. More content goes hand in hand with more bugs. Why not fix the bugs we have all been experiencing for weeks before adding a pink teddy bear suit? I would much rather have a fully working game than some cosmetics that don't even help. 

Some might say, ""but SethTizzy it's a free game cut them some slack."" And yeah I agree of course BR is free but it's a GOOD free game. There is a huge difference between this game and other free games. On top of that, Epic Games is the freaking developer. These guys are and have been capable of triple-a titles. They should know how to fix things and I'm not saying they don't. I'm saying what I think a lot of people believe, focus more on quality rather than quantity.  

I wish y'all could just cut back on the item shop and the addition of weapons into the game and just focus on the bugs that sometimes break the game. 

All in all, I do love this game. I just think it could be way better. I would hate to see Epic end up like EA. I don't want you to become money hungry with the skins and dances and emotes. I would just hate to see that. 

Much love Epic, I know you are all so dedicated to the game but I think just take a step back and fix things before adding more content. More content equals more bugs on top of the old ones.",FortNiteBR

The Battle Pass bonus friend XP is not working for over 2 weeks now, it affects all BP owners and EPIC isn't doing anything","Hey guys, I don't know what to do anymore, this is a serious problem and EPIC doesn't do anything to fix it. Do you remember my old thread here called 
[""Reddit, I need your help. The friend XP is not working anymore for over a week now, it affects all of you and I don't think EPIC even knows this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7uapnw/reddit_i_need_your_help_the_friend_xp_is_not/)?

Well, that was, like my old title says, a whole week ago and there is still no fix for this, not in the last patch, not in the upcoming patch, not even a mentioning in the ""known bugs"" list, nothing.  For all of you who don't know what I'm talking about, The Battle Pass friend bonus XP (at least on PS4) is not working for 2 weeks now, which means it hugely affects the leveling progress and more important, the battle pass for that people have paid for.

When you have 3 high level friends, it's around 90% extra XP that you are missing out every single round, which is around 30% of all XP combined that you would get every single round (normal 100%, your 70-110% extra XP and the missing around 90% friend XP). I rarely see anyone noticing this at all but it is a huge bug and it was in fact a part of the sold Battle Pass, and I think we should get that fixed immediately.

I already had several people confirming this problem and it even seems to be related to the not working ""play with a friend"" challenge. It seems like the game just doesn't recognize friends anymore.

I need your help again to get this spread out, cause no matter what I try, EPIC doesn't take this serious. It affects every Battle Pass owner, the season is almost over and I think we all deserve to get a real statement about this from EPIC, not just a small answer, a statement and most importantly, a fix.

Thank you.",FortNiteBR

In order to put on a good show with dozens of kills, nothing better than to rush enemies, build and double pump them. I get it, it's great to just kill people nice and easy.

But a Gray pump (super common weapon) beeing better than a blue SMG, or purple pistol, or golden pistol? Doesn't make any sense. Those guns are far harder to come by and should be used. The game gets boring if all you need to do is get a double pump and build to victory. Let's learn how to use other weapons, increase diversity and creativity in the game! 

I'm willing to bet most kills in the game are by far done with a shotty. Its nerf is very badly needed and to be honest it's still way to good in the new shooting model. And if you watch those streams, even with the new model they are still melting people with the double pump.

2 - the first shot accuracy

Some are saying it incentivizes camping and passive play.

 Because you know... you have to AIM in order to shoot.

First of all, that's how it's supposed to be! Spamming the trigger and jumping like a rabbit may get you kills, but it turns the game into a very boring shooting model. 
Jumping should penalize accuracy and staying still should increase it! 

But also, this is well countered by the damage drop off. It creates balance. Some guns do have a drop off way to high (which has been covered and probably will be addressed) but it is mostly a very welcome change.

Let's open ourselves to change, gentleman. It is here for the best.

I am excited by this new model and can't wait until the next one is live. Thanks Epic for putting the effort, it is very welcome by the community :)",FortNiteBR

Adding some consistency to ranged engagements is great, and the damage fall-off appears to be a good mechanic to prevent potential ""lazering"". The Scoped AR needs serious range tweaks but I'm sure Epic is already aware of that.

However, I was surprised to see such a massive reduction in the shotgun crit multiplier. 
Don't get me wrong, it's worthwhile giving SMGs a buff to make them a more appealing alternative to shotguns, but I strongly feel that this nerf is excessive for a number of reasons:

* It lowers the CQC skill-gap and ability for individuals to make plays against multiple opponents
* It doesn't solve double-pumping, it actually strengthens it
* It further emphasizes perceived/real damage inconsistencies
* It makes Tac shotguns horrible (arguably inferior to SMGs)

Now I die to shotguns A LOT, but it rarely feels unfair to me. Why? Because **the skill-gap in Fortnite is positioning**; the race for the high ground and the speed and intelligence with which you build. Most of the time you didn't lose a fight because of *a shotgun*, you lost because you got *outmaneuvered*. I think that some people have an inclination to blame ""OP shotguns!!"" for deaths that were guaranteed regardless of the weapon used.

The reason for that is simple; bad players often tend to latch on to things they are unskilled with or don't understand and blame them as the source of their troubles. ""If they just nerfed X my struggles would be solved."" ""If they just removed Y my KD would be so high!"" Of course these players will never be happy and they will simply move on to their next-perceived roadblock instead of channeling that energy into improving/adapting. There are exceptions of course, but it is an established trend which I have witnessed firsthand.

In reality, this shotgun nerf does not actually help low-skill players--they are still going to lose most CQC fights. On the flip side, the skill-ceiling has been lowered for good players who are able to set up a perfect kill shot. Good players will be trading far more damage to secure otherwise easy kills because the shotgun TTK has been dramatically slowed. Anecdotally, I feel that the flow of CQC is gone with this nerf because shotgun fights have been artificially slowed. The brisk pace is why I was drawn to Fortnite and largely the reason I have continued to love playing it.

On the subject of double-pumping; it's objectively broken, obviously. The pump shotgun is designed to trade rate-of-fire for damage and running two is essentially an exploit in every since of the word. I want you to consider this scenario for a moment: a 1v1 between two players both at 200. Player 1 has a single pump and gets the first shot, player 2 has two pumps.

Original (2.5x crit):

*Player 1* lands a max-damage crit on *player 2* dealing 238 damage, and killing them.

Shooting Test #1 (1.5x crit):

*Player 1* lands a max-damage crit on *player 2*, dealing 143 damage. *Player 2* immediately double pumps *player 1* before they can follow-up, killing them.

As you can see, a good player with a single pump can still outplay a double-pump with a well-placed headshot with the original multiplier. Inversely, ST1 considerably increases the effectiveness of double-pump and even introduces a checkmate condition into certain scenarios.


There is something just profoundly jarring about barrel-stuffing an enemy with a green pump and seeing 140 damage pop up. **I agree that there is room for tuning shotguns, however I believe that it would be better to address double-shotgun switching and tune fall-off/range instead of point blank damage.**

I come from Destiny, and over the past few years I've seen Bungie arbitrarily slow the game to irrelevance and remove just about everything fun and skillful from PvP all while ignoring quality feedback. Seeing Epic's approach to their games (starting with my time with Paragon, may it rest in peace) has restored my faith in game development. I hope in Fortnite they focus on buffing things up instead of nerfing them down whenever possible.

Thanks for giving my thoughts a read.

EDIT: Well that was quick! [2.4.2 patch](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v-2-4-2-patch-notes) might offer a nice middle-ground for shotguns with a 2.0 crit multiplier. Looking forward to trying it out.",FortNiteBR

I decided to post today because of something verry important that would make a real serious difference in my game and i'm shure the game of others as well.

I play on Xbox one and after 5 days of playing all day I still can't even build something serious. The only thing I can build is a wall on panic when someone shoot me from an angle I don't know and a stair to go pick up these chests. 

After 100 games I still can't build a fort. I feel naked and vulnerable to practice while playing. Also how i'm I suppose to know where to shoot if a target is far away? 

Imagine a map just like a regular map but with nobody on it. Unlimited materials and tons of small shooting range targets on the hills and everywhere. Just imagine a corner of the map with moving targets that go from one side to the other I would be able to adjust the space for the range to hit target now I can't hit nothing.

Imagine being able to practice for hours building forts. All kinds of forts but the main thing is getting used to it and practicing so we don't have to play 880 games total to build something pretty good. That would perfect someones game. It would for mine that's for shure.

It's almost kind of rude to throw us in the action with no place to train and practice the basics. It lead to frustration, surprise and losing hundreds or thousands of games just to perfect the skill of building. 

My points is are we are dealing with a system. Our own system. So we need to be able to learn, practice alot and getting good at least for the basics. Especially for consoles people who play it's alot of options and buttons that push be pushed in a specific order for things to happen leave alone the surprise effect, pressure kick in for a beginner it's pure chaos.

Please, can you add it to the game?

Thanks
Sam

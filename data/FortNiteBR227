But the main bit. People like me who started playing in season 4-5 have had no chance to buy the battle passes, or any of the store skins.

So i propose that after completing a battle pass(eg season 5) We get the option to complete the last one we didnt do (we would still pay for the battle pass again.) This would mean that for me, i would have too complete season 4,3 and 2 before i can get black night, or 270 tiers.

This should keep all the ‘og’ players happy and keep an incentive to play the game as we would work towards an old, cool looking skin.

Just my thoughts though",FortNiteBR

The phone was not in retail/demo mode. I’ve been hearing that

 1. Factory resetting doesn’t work. How would you know that Samsung Accounts link to the IMEI and MAC? Okay, I get it. You know the phone has its own digital serial number. But why would they go through all that trouble to stop people from redeeming more than one skin?

2. You have to wait for the first person to get their skin/24 hours/48 hours to do the factory reset and redeem again. This makes more sense as they would see the IMEI twice in a queue to deliver the skin. Epic would probably handle that and I’m sure they’re more protective of the skin then Samsung because the promotion was too easy to get around. Could’ve easily been a code received on purchase.

It’s been almost 24 hours and I’m really hoping it worked. Anyone let me know their successes and failures. ",FortNiteBR

Loading Screen #1](https://imgur.com/gallery/RavxRbG)"", Drift looks clearly confused and the other skins seem to be meeting him for the first time (the Brite Bomber is introducing each other) in the background you can see a rift and the Durr Burger, the squad must've been driving in the ATK, saw the rift and they might have seen Drift come out.

But myself I feel like I'm getting bored of the game now I've played since end of what was season 1 although it wasn't a season.

I watched a clip from Tfue's stream talking about skins and he said it's just a skin in a virtual game it has no advantage why do people worship skins and have to have the latest one's. 

Got me thinking he's right I have 63 skin's along with other items and I could quite happily make a new account and play as a default/ no skin and enjoy the game or just use a starter pack skin. 

I don't fully regret buying all my items I o
Prehaps should have stopped at the xmas skins and season 2 and not got caught in all the hype with my mates and family. 

I'm sure there's some big spenders on hear and some who haven't bought anything what's your thoughts.

As I'm sure many of you may know, moisty mire was a location in fortnite from day one and in seasn 5, it was removed to make way for the desert . It was one of my favorites to land at and I'm certain that it might be the case for some others as well. In the post I will provide my reasons for the location to be re implemented and a two methods as to how it can be done .

**Why It Should Be Re Added ?**

My reasons for moisty to be added back is that I love the location and that I have gotten several wins from landing there . It was a good place to practice building due to the abundance in trees . In addition, I also think that it was good because it was a more laid back place where you didn't have to worry about being rushed whilst looting and farming . A third reason being that the location was unique as it was a swamp , so it would add some more variety to the game , something that epic wants. Even if moisty may seem like a waste  , I think that the spot has a lot of potential especially if Epic play around with it . 

**How it can be re added to the game ?**

​As I mentioned in the introduction, I will provide two methods for Moisty Mire's re implementation into fortnite .

1. Remove Lucky Landing 

Lets face it, I know that moisty is kind of a dump, but do you know what is an even bigger dump . If you guessed lucky landing , then you're absolutely right . Not only is the loot trash but there isn't really a lot . The only named location that I can think of with less loot is tomato town , but even that beats it as it is now the awesome tomato temple . To summarise just take the lucky landing area and put moisty there. Leave the shrines and the bridge though as I think that those places have some character and I want them to stay.

 

2.Put It Somewhere Else

Originally, I thought that removing lucky was the best way before thinking  that some people ​actually like the location and I thought , what if there was another way. So I looked at the map and found that there was an empty spot where the 5 houses used to be until they were removed for the world cup stadium, but never put back . So, instead of letting this place go to waste, I thought, why don't they dump moisty there ?

**Conclusion**

I think that moisty should be re implemented as I enjoyed landing there and it is a nice calm spot to loot and farm, not to mention an awesome swamp. Personally, I don't really mind any of the two methods. Thank you for reading the whole post if you made it this far . I should have another one on the way.",FortNiteBR

No SMG/Drum gun (except p90) in the game mode. I haven’t had this much fun in all of season 5. 

Epic, take the damn hint already. Nobody likes the current meta. Spray and pray shouldn’t be in the game. Just adds more chaos due to the RNG factor that already plays a huge role in the game. 1000% more willing to deal with double pumps again. At least you had a chance against those by building.

Fortnite is full of occultic and illuminati symbolism. Now these are not easter eggs. 

Just hear me out and remember that this is a multi million dollar production game. Every piece of content or art gets approved by multiple people. Look at my post with an open mind.

I think that every one knows here that Epic games really loves puzzles and making us guess of what is to come. I've been here since season 2 and have read so many theories on upcoming content. They love to hide things.

Now everyone knows that the illuminati theories are all about symbolism and what you see most of the time is [the All Seeing Eye](https://imgur.com/edkcPkO). Epic Games seem to love it, they even calm the storm [""the eye of the storm""](https://imgur.com/a/lonQeqg)

Fortnite Eye symbolism:

It is also of course known that the ""Save the World"" part of the game uses the Eye Pyramid symbolism a lot, but it crosses over to Battle Royale.

Being a full blown ""conspiracy theorist"" I suggest that season 5 Drift is part of a cult. A secret society. Why? He also has weird occultic symbolism [on his back](https://imgur.com/a/m6x2bhh) and mask. He [transforms to evil](https://imgur.com/a/nXwuZGa) with his eyes eventually glowing like he possessed.

Now I'm aware that more skins have glowing eyes, including the level 100 tier skin of season 5 called [""Ragnarok"".](https://imgur.com/a/oUJKlbL)

If we look into what Ragnarok means, it turns out that means [""the destruction of the gods and of all things in a final battle with the evil powers.""](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ragnarok)

You can learn more about Ragnarok yourself. It's pretty scary.

The black cube that appeared recently made me do this post. The black cube it connected to the planet Saturn and it's hexagon for a lot of people and the rabbit hole is pretty fucking deep. I won't go into it here because it's way too much information. Just do a Google search for Black Cube illuminati or symbolism

I think the black cube [is also connected to the cult or secret society that Drift is apart of.](https://imgur.com/a/TjGDf2p)

The black cube makes a scary sound and was spawned by [a purple lightning bolt.](https://imgur.com/a/YdltJsd)

[Epic games really, really likes lightning bolts.](https://imgur.com/a/UpGPLUg) (I lost a lot of images of skins that have lightning bolts, there is so much more.. this is like 25%). 

I also have a lot of satanism/luciferian/pizzagate symbolism that I found in Fortnite... I'm not going to explain any of it really, this is way too deep and people who don't know about a lot of this will find it fucking stupid. But... I'll just post all of it in 2 Imgur posts for the people who are interested.

I sometimes load into a solo and think ""fuck it, can't be bothered"" and leave the game. It might have something to do with being off of school and having no other hobbies other than video games.

I've done a lot of research wondering it it really was my computer. However, as other likewise posts suggests, this is entirely on epics side.

I hope this is the right place for this post but here goes. I got 2 samsung galaxy note 9, and on 1 i got the headphone promotion, and on the other phone we decided to get the v-bucks for our nephew that plays fortnite (on PS4). We did everything that we were suppose to but now we have an issue. 

​

When we log into his fortnite account on the galaxy note 9, we can see the 15k v-bucks in his account. When he logs into his ps4 (same account) he does not see the v-bucks but he does see the skin that came with the promotion. Does anyone know whats going on and how he can get his v-bucks to show up on his ps4???

Third Image: [https://prnt.sc/koaadm](https://prnt.sc/koaadm) (The translation for this is:  

Rune tattoo Inguz;  

The rune Inguz (OR ING) is related to the Nordic God ING. The fertile and creative God. Therefore, this tattoo expresses the moments in which the solutions arrive and things change for the better)

After much research, I managed to decipher the cube marks, it is a fusion of two etymologies, some are Nordic runes and others are proto-Indian symbols.  
And even that many did not notice it, since the appearance of drift they were already leaving clues. If you look at your mask that many let go, it has a Inguz Nordic Rune, this rune has many meanings. But perhaps the most accurate meaning is that of the end of an era and the beginning of a new one, talk about a seed that will germinate in mother earth and it will open the way to new opportunities and new beginnings; the end of an old era and the beginning of a new era...  
Drift is that, which will start the new era. Drift  is the one who brought the cube, and it is that seed that will cause it  to germinate in the earth and in turn to something new, that seed is  directed to loot lake to open that gap that will give rise to something  new in fortnite.  
The  executor came to fix and prevent all this from taking place, since  while drifting tries to give way to that era, it is affecting other  eras, the mixture of ages that was made on the map.  
Ragnarok  is not a good character ragnarok is the one who will make bad use of  what he wants to do, and when drif is taking that step, Ragnarok will take  advantage and use the power against him.  
That's when the executor tries to stop everything.  
And fix the oddities that derive from committing that errror.  
Remember that drif its name as such means ""out of course"", drift has the power to open gaps and existential planes.  
And how the photos show, drift leads to know the new places he brought with him fornite characters.  
As such drift is not bad but is causing spatio-temporal problems.  
Now the marks that the cube leaves are proto-indic symbols, the mark that it left is a fusion, it means past.  
And the following marks will be in this sequence. 

1.-Past.

2.- Beginning  
3.-Present  
4.- Origin  
5.- Future  
6.- Union  
7.- Era.  


The first mark left by the cube is passed which the following brands will say what has already been mentioned. It's a fortnite ad that will give a new start in season 6 and that will happen when the cube arrives to loot lake which will cause a clash of dimensions, a temporary instability which they will try to Fix...

Though there is a sign ""press x to mute player"", pressing this button does nothing and the single thing we can do is to invite these players to epic friends list (like really?).

Insult to an injury is the fact that every 2-3 matchmakings you get kids who are just shouting straightforward into mic. This leads to a situation in which I'm not only hearing my friend, but also footsteps of enenies or hardly anything honestly 

I know we can solve this by disabling voice chat and work through teamspeak or something, but since we just operate on console, it's not a possibility frankly.

This issue makes squads unplayable to some extent, considering amount of little kids shouting in a voice chat and guys with distored screechy sounds.

Simply put, the whole set is dedicated to john wick, a film franchise.
The skin itself is john wick without a doubt
The glider is Wicks car.
But the pickaxe?
Most people wonder why he has a pencil for his pickaxe.
Well, for those who arent aware, simply put, its a call back to a scene in John Wick 2, where john wick takes a guy out using a pencil when he isnt able to use his gun. Thats why its given the name ""trusty number 2""

This was just a quick explanation for those who didnt know.

Feel as if I could never outbuild someone rpging me or even get close to him to sort of attempt to counter him. Often time's im stuck just boxing myself in to avoid splash damage which then puts me at substantially less materials than the person who already has high ground which makes it that  more difficult to retake high ground. How to deal with people RPG'ing you from a high ground location like a mountain.

&amp;#x200B;

Say for example circle is small, he's on the mountain, i gotta get up there somehow. This is often the case because usually it's me and another person standing, 99% of the time he ends up winning simply because of the RPG. I have no alternatives, no ideas at this point, advice me reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the most horrible player, like to think im at least average with 2.70 k/d. I just can't figure out how to deal with someone who has an RPG that is at least equally as good as me. It seems impossible to win that exchange because of this simple fact. By the time he's done spamming his rpg im literally down at least 300 materials from trying to block his RPG spam. Now, he's on a mountain, i gotta climb up there somehow while still trying to defend my head, that'll cost me another 100-200 materials easy. Some might say, just sit at the bottom and camp. If i do that, the person above spams me forever and lets be honest, last 2 standing usually have over 500 AR bullets so either way im going to lose a ton of materials. What can be done at this point or am i looking at it from such a basic point of view? Are there alternatives?

I don't feel Fortnite has gotten worse by any means and I think the game has added several things that really have been good additions (particularly the apples/mushrooms which are handy) ... but increasingly it feels like there is too much stuff and not enough balance. 

Also, increasingly alot of it feels like junk if you have your preferences and favs, for example I hate bursts enough to choose a grey m16 over a gold famas, so right there is 2 guns (technically 4 if all colours are included) that I won't touch and I'm sure each of us feel that way about certain items.

Personally, I feel like there is probably two more scoped/ranged weapons than necessary (Thermal, AR Scoped, Auto Sniper, Sniper, 50.Cal, Hunting Rifle feels too much), same with pistols (Silenced, 9mm, revolver, deagle, duals) ... and now with the personal rifts and shockwave grenades ... we have 5 inventory slots and a multitude of options and yet only a handful of legitimate 'meta' choices outside of personal preference.

I won't touch shotguns over a good SMG this meta, I won't go for bursts over regular AR's, autosniper is mostly trash, scoped rifle is mostly trash, 9mm is obselete after opening, silenced pistol is mostly obselete after opening, impulse grenades are high skill/situational, portaforts are mostly useless over just building, revolver sucks, handcannon sucks ... that's alot of items that are floating around the game atm that aren't used.

I don't know what to do to get better. I have seen a lot of videos on tips and trick, but i need the experience. I am always stuck on the bus don't know where to drop. I want to drop some where safe but I feel like I don't get in to any fights so I don't learn anything. I'm scared to drop in populated areas I feel like I would just die and not learn anything.

It is simply next to impossible to win games as a console dominated squad. By the end of a match, the majority of squads left are pc dominated that dominate a console-heavy squad. The skill gap that should have been decreased when builder pro was introduced (and was shortly) has grown past what it once was due to the competitive level pc players generally play at (i.e. the above average pc player is much better than the above average console player). What id love to see to save my squad (which is the time I enjoy playing the game the most) is a smarter cross play lobby that recognizes the majority platform for a squad and places the squad into a cross play lobby of majority console/pc/switch/mobile squads.

Secondly :knocks now the whole point of knocks as far as I can tell is to ensure that you must kill the whole in order to earn the elimination but its gotten to the point where getting knocked is just death something needs to change, maybe lower the time it takes for someone to die from a knock but make it so you cant get finished, or something of the sorts suggestions are welcome .

it becomes a game of either extremely high skill or no skill at all, the average players loose out ok enjoyment because of these frustrating metas, This used to be the game I could play to destress now its so frustrating I have to stop playing.

It would be an epic or legendary item that would take up one item spot. It would have limited durability, but would deflect some bullets or give reduced damage to the player. The shield would only work from the front, so people could still shoot you in the back or sides, but the top would cover your face (not head). You couldn’t shoot anyone while you have it equipped, but maybe you could build? (Debatable)

What is the purpose of this?

It would be a better counter to the Spray and Pray meta. Somebody trying to get you with an SMG? Pull out your riot shield and run while they try and insta-kill you.

How would this be balanced?

Like I said, once you select it, you can’t shoot, and you can still get sniped in the back. The point of this item is to counter the meta, but if it changes, it would still be viable. Maybe you could have different rarities, each one giving more defense and/or more durability. Done bullets could still get through the shield, but at a somewhat decent reduction in damage.

Thanks for reading this. It probably won’t get added, but still thought I would share this.",FortNiteBR

I’ll be having good games where I have 5-8 kills and I’ll be stoked, only to lose to guys who drop 12+ kills by landing perfect snipes on moving targets, I.e major league gamers. 

These people are phenomenal players and slaughter you before you even have a chance to react. If epic put in servers that matched folks according to your skill level then things would be a lot more fun. Winning X amount of games or posting a certain score that determines what lobby you play in would be awesome. I must’ve had at least 20+ games where I lose to somebody I had no shot against. At least when putting people against the same skill level as them would not only help keep a noobish audience by letting them learn the game against people who are also learning but it would make for streams to be a lot more interesting when you hypothetically have Ninja vs Tfue instead of having Tfue go noob hunting. 

I highly doubt epic would consider something like this but in the form of an LTM would be a awesome, showing who’s the best from each ‘class’ so to speak.

Close range combat feels a lot more rewarding with shotguns, especially since the pellets are uniform and building becomes a lot more feasible because people can't spray down your builds faster than you can place your next wall. 

I understand the circumstances which led to this meta because shotguns were at the extreme end of one spectrum being able to one hit kill players and run multiple weapons to cancel out reloading, but all the spray meta has done is switch things to the other extreme end of the spectrum. The entire purpose of Epic preventing us double shotgunning was to make it so that we could  only run weapon of the particular archetype to utilise its characteristics without getting unintended benefits (at least I beleive so anyway). But the spray meta has made this position even worse because not only are players now getting both benefits anyway, but the SMG variations of weapons are also significantly easier to use, reducing the skill gap and they make building less important in particular circumstances. 

In order to be successful in this meta, you need two close range weapons, just like we needed two shotguns before, the only difference is that one of the weapons is an SMG now, which is a lot worse.

([I can personally confirm that this works](https://i.imgur.com/tz6up9o)). Note that this must be done on a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or a Samsung Tab 4: 


* Find a demo unit in your local store (smaller and/or less visited is better)
* On the home screen of the Note 9 or Tab 4, swipe down from the top of the screen to bring up the quick settings menu 
* Check that none of the rows on the quick menu say that the device is in retail mode. **If the device is in retail mode this will not work.** 
* If all is clear, find the Galaxy Apps app (you may have to use the search function by swiping down from the middle of the screen) and begin downloading Fortnite. Downloading from the play store will not work. If Fortnite is already installed on the device then it has likely been used for this already. 
* At this point you may be prompted to log into your Samsung account. If you do not currently have one, you can create one [here](https://account.samsung.com/membership/index.do).
* Once Fortnite has downloaded (which may take a while if the device is on store WiFi), log into your Fortnite account. 
* If all the steps above were followed correctly, you should be able to get to the main menu of Fortnite.
* In order to link the skin to your account, you have to play and complete the 3 games required to claim the skin. 
* In 24 - 48 hours the skin should be rewarded to your account. 

That’s it! If you have any questions please feel free to sound off in the comments. ",FortNiteBR

I'm just concerned about the current state of the servers as well as overall performance of the game and would like to potentially start a discussion with the community.**

​

**Server Performance**

​Over the last couple of weeks, I've noticed the overall stability of the servers (I play on US West) has been deteriorating progressively, and as of today it has been unplayable for me and a few friends of mine in the current area.  I cant go one minute without the ping spiking from a stable 10-20 to around 200-300 before dropping back down to normal, but that is more than enough to completely ruin the experience and mess up any current game's I've played.  In one case, the server completely seized, capped at 1100ping, and everyone was stuck completely still in game without being able to move.  Overall the fluidity of the servers just doesn't feel good at all, picking up items seems slow and sluggish, building mistakes are more common, 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had a whole lot of time to dig around the subreddit due to work, but I really haven't seen much attention except a few small threads that don't necessarily go anywhere.  If there is some kind of statement or something that I missed then please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Game Performance**

Now I'll start out by saying that I've got a fairly nice setup, so I've got a feeling that my PC isn't necessarily the problem.  When I first started out playing this game last year I was able to run this game no problem at close to max settings with an average of 150-200FPS.  Of course, a lot of content and changes have been made to the game so its completely understandable that the game obviously takes a lot more resources to run as smoothly as it used to.  However, I've gone from playing on Medium to High settings, all the way to completely low settings with Far render distance just to keep a somewhat steady 150-200 since the start of Season 5.  Even at settings this low my FPS still drops well below 100 in areas like Tilted Towers and Retail, and even below 60 during a lot of close quarters fights.  The majority of the friends I play with have pretty decent rigs as well and they're all suffering from the same performance issues.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that, I and a few others have been getting massive FPS drops for about 5-10 seconds at a time a few times per game that are absolutely inhibiting.  If anyone has any comments or reasons about this please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Game and server performance have been in a pretty poor state as of recently for quite a few people, and I'm just a bit worried that Epic isn't taking it seriously enough as I've seen very little discussion about it lately.  I'd like to shed a bit more light on the subject and possibly start a discussion about what's been going on.  I hope that someone from Epic may be able to update us on the current issues some of us players are having at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

**If I've missed anything important recently or some of you are having other issues that I did not mention, please correct me or share if you've been having issues as well.**

To alleviate this, I’ve developed a ritual. If I knock someone down, I go over to them and cry with the waterworks emote. This indicates my sorrow at having to kill them during war (talking about 50 v 50 mode here).

After that’s gone on for awhile, I salute them. This shows that I respect them as a fellow soldier, and commemorate their sacrifice and dedication. They will not die in vain.

After that, it’s either let them perish on their own terms in a coffin I make for them (four wooden walls around them) or a quick shot to the head.

He now causes players to glide through the air due to reduced gravity and is actually quite cool. 

You can see that he is surrounded by a 'field', which is where this low gravity state is contained and around that field there are what i believe to be gravitational field lines or magnetic field lines (see below).  

I don't want to go crazy and suggest that Kevin may turn into the world as we know it but maybe this will help us understand the physics around him more.

&amp;#x200B;

do you think something like this will happen? i dont want to spend so much time in a game that doesnt allow you to put any real skill into it at all. when i watch good players they all just move around with no strategy at all and just overpower there enemys with superior experience. youtube videos about good fortnite plays are not even a thing. in other games like csgo or league of legends the youtuber gain main views by such compilations about top plays of the week or something. all fortnite videos are about some new things or just rng plays (oh he hit him mid air with a sniper after he did a emote). i think i should say that iam a competitive player for many many years. i was peak master tier in league of legends and a very good starcraft player too. so when i say this game doesnt value real skill i mean it because i know what real skill looks like. i would really like to play fortnite because i have never been a fan of teamgames (league was still the best competitive game for a long time) so here is my complaint my suggestion and my question i had to write down.",FortNiteBR

The heavy shotgun is probably the most balanced shotgun right now so I don't think it should be changed but rather a new slug shotgun was added (KSG from COD?). 

It would have a set damage and damage fall off (or maybe a projectile), and 6 slugs. It should be able to one shot with a headshot, which will provide a skill gap (what a lot of people want, myself included), also directly countering the spray and prey meta. It should shoot faster than the pump, maybe a bit slower than the heavy or the same speed. 

Let me know what you guys think, I really feel it will change the meta for the better and make the game a lot more fun.

Another thing people will probably say is that it's Lucky Landing. If it were Lucky, wouldn't we see the red tops that most buildings there usually have? This leads me to believe that this whole ""castle"" POI was under our noses the whole time.

Either that, or I'm completely crazy, and someone will point out that it's some other POI or un-named location somewhere on the map and completely thrash my train of thought. I'll be honest, the chances of that happening are probably super likely, but I just wanted to share my findings with you all.

None of these are skill related.,"I don't really see much if any discussion about these items but they really should be talked about more.  I play with all 3 of these items and I find they give me a distinct advantages over a lot of other players.  These advantages are all legal within the gaming space, it just comes down to dedication and well, money.  I fully understand not everyone can or is willing to buy these things but you should realize that this is making a difference. 

1) I play on an Xbox One X.  I'm in the lobby faster than anyone else.  My processor is faster at rendering and with 4K capability I can see things more clearly than you can and I almost never get grainy images or slow down of any kind.

2) I use an Elite Controller.  I have custom settings so that my triggers fire with just the lightest touch.  I also have paddles underneath so that I can jump and crouch while never removing my right thumb from the stick.  That means I can actively aim while jumping/crouching.  I also have a longer right thumb stick for more precision movement.  If you are on a standard controller your thumb is on ""A"" to jump and so you can't aim.  I am doing both at the same time with 
a higher precision stick.  I'm then pulling the trigger a split second faster because I don't have to push all the way down. 

3) I use a 28in gaming monitor.  It's 4K capable to match the Xbox X and it has a 1MS frame refresh rate.  That means I am probably seeing you and reacting to you and your movements faster than you can see and react to mine.  I can't stress this one enough.  If you are using a giant TV (I was previously using a 65in screen) your mind cannot take it all in fast enough and it is harder to process and react.  The second issue, almost no TVs have truly great gaming refresh rates.  

I'm not claiming to be amazing.  I'm a solid player that has around a 2.0 KD this season (it was around 1.50 last season before I switched to the monitor).  I just want to make the community a little more aware that you may be playing at a real disadvantage and it may have nothing to do with your actual skill level.  

Best of luck out there!

I think its because I am WAY more familiar with a PS4 controller than I am with M+KB but I have tried practicing in Playground A LOT but it still doesn't really help out. also I've been using M+KB for maybe 3+4 years now but only maybe half year on Fortnite. ,FortNiteBR

The game mode clearly states all weapon drops are gold, and it's safe to assume most people consider those as weapons. Also there are clear alternative explosives in the Grenade launcher and RPG. I feel the solo mode specifically has been dominated by use of these non legendary items because they are spawned extremely often. I ran into a guy holding 12 c4 within the first 3 minutes of the game. 

I don't know if these items should be completely removed, but they definitely should drop less in a game mode that is supposed to be legendary weapons only. ",FortNiteBR

It all came down to people sitting in box's and basically all RNG. I feel like competitive fortnite should have 2 matches, and they both would consist of 50 players. This would mean more mid game fights because with less people, the players would feel more comfortable because they wont get 3rd partied as easily with 100 players after a fight.

Muting must be brought back, for the sake of our hearing.","A good friend and I have played this game religiously since October, and we have no choice but to talk using in-game chat. We have NAT type issues 95% of the time when we play, so we can’t use party chat. And that’s all fine and dandy when we play duos, but if we have a 3rd friend with us we have to run squad mode; here’s where the problem comes in. 

I love this community and they never cease to amaze me with laughs in-game. Sometimes though, our 4th player will be some person who finds an insane amount of enjoyment pestering his squad mates with either screaming or general annoyance. 

Now I remember what it’s like being a middle school/high schooler and how it was honestly kinda fun trolling on games like MW2 and such. But it’s not just limited to kids, in my experience the younger kids are actually pretty good and try really hard to get those wins, I’ve had grown ass men in my squad shouting and blatantly trying to ruin my hearing. So EPIC this is my plea; bring back the ability to mute. It’s not that any of us want to mute our squad but sometimes they leave you no choice. 

TL:DR - We need the ability to mute brought back. Can’t hear footsteps over these kids. ",FortNiteBR

I also love to build and consider myself a good builder both offensively and defensively but lately I'm finding build fights tedious and honestly boring.

They all follow the same kind of flow. You build up and someone gets the high ground after a while and the other will make their way back down and hide in the build somewhere meaning you have to scale down and find them, if you don't kill them or they kill you.

Still love the game but wondering how building and finding will change over the next few months /years.

Here are the reasons:
1. Gliders are easily the least bought item because they dont either look good or end up even being used enough to make up for how much you spent
2 you only see your gliders for like 30 seconds a match when you're lucky
3 you dont get your vbucks worth
4 epic wouldn't lose much money because of little gliders are bought and how much skins cost in comparison

Here are some of my ideas for challenges
Prismatic: open a llama, supply drop, chest and ammo box in a game (hence the different colors in such a beautiful glider) 

Deep space lander and shuttle: get 30 wins with a space skin to have one of the two ( they're seasonal as so are the skins so it makes sense)

Half shell: take 50 shield damage from other players in one game (obvious reasons)

Cloud strike: travel 25km with your glider from a launch pad (or) use a launch pad to escape the storm 15 times (pretty obvious reasons 

I just thought about this when looking at gliders in the shop and realizing how most people dont buy them because of their uselessness or because of their price. I myself have only bought the beautiful prismatic and it's the only glider I use and probably will ever use. seeing these challenges be put in the game would be very cool because it shows prestige for once in fortnite. 

And talking about the refunding players would either get a choice of refunding their glider for vbucks and having to the challenge (if they dont like the glider) or it would be auto refunded so they have to the challenge. Epic makes enough of everything but glider si yeah",FortNiteBR

I would destroy someone's build they'd fall but instead of falling straight down, they would appear as if they did but then move 3 or 4 steps right of where I am aiming and as soon as I aim out and milliseconds before I can build a wall, I die. I don't think I've ever been more frustrated with this game lol, I am a pretty experience xbox player and I wouldn't say I'm bad at the game at all. It's really just lag and on my end I have a ping of 9 so I know it can't be me.

I've also supplied the Season 3 EXP table if you choose to compare last season to this season. 

**NOTE:** This season you gain 5K EXP for each weekly challenge instead of 4K EXP. You also receive EXP instead of Battle Pass Tiers when you reach tier 100. You will reach tier 100 sooner since each weekly challenge also has a hidden 10 Battle Stars which equates to one full Battle Pass Tier.

I have a buddy who works for Epic games. He told me some stuff about season 5 and i want to share some information.
You know that meteor that hit Dusty? Well it's a egg and inside of that egg is a big leviathan without the suit. 

2 new LMT's will be coming near the end of season 4. A 50v50 but one person in one team will control the big leviathan and the team with the leviathan have to escort him to wailing woods or greasy grove. The other team has to take it down before it's too late! There's infinite lives in the gamemode but no building.

Omega Vs Alpha or Charlie. Alpha or Charlie (They haven't decided a name yet) is the blockbuster skin. It's basically 50v50 but with 1 hero on each team. I can't share any details yet because they are not finished yet.

Tilted will be damaged and moisty 80% Destroyed by the leviathan. Dusty Diviot shall be patched up a bit (The factoy will return and most of the craters will be gone)

An airstrike item will be added, It's kinda like the red zone from PUBG but few players will be able the choose the location.

Season 5 will be history themed Romans,Greeks,Egyptians And the tier 100 skin will be the Flying Dutch Man.

New traps will be coming Like the impulse trap, if you walk by it  you will get shot in the air and most likely die.

A Durr Buger meal will be replacing the Slurp juice.

STW will be free mid season 5.

Those are all of the leaks i can tell you. I wish i could tell more but then i will ruin the suprise.

And if you don't belive me check this post in 2-3 months :)

My little brother noticed immediately how dumb this was affer I told him and changed all his passwords, made a new psn and transferred his skins to that account. By transfer I mean unlinking his Psn that was scammed and linking a new one. Anyway he was so close to losing the account that it was basically a sign off battle between the two. After a relief, Season 4 comes around the corner and he gets notified that his account is banned for account sharing and he will never be able to use it again. I still hope to this day that he'll receive a message from Epic. I tried putting it on Reddit but had 0 upvotes with no success to the front page. Life sucks lmao.

Players could join and create clans to play against or with each other. They can also make a clan wars mode where clans compete for victory and the top clans receive a cosmetic reward and maybe some v-bucks. The clan war mode could be of 10 clan per game with 10 players each. Another addition could be that all of the 10 clans have territories and before the match begins they have to build a fortress and defend their flag and steal other team flags. The Circle would be a bit small so walking is easier and spawns of jump pads and impulse grenade with a dedicated slot for impulse to travel faster. Some players would defend the fort while others can attack. Also a clan leveling system can be introduced where the more the kills or wins of the clan the more xp they get and can get some rewards for leveling.,FortNiteBR

1. We'll start with some people claiming that last time the red knight was in the shop it said ""Last chance"". As I have not found any picture or a dev confirming this I don't belive this to be true.

2. People claim it was a season exclusive, however this was confirmed not to be true by a dev. Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8d1o8n/red\_knight\_is\_not\_a\_season\_exclusive\_skin\_for\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8d1o8n/red_knight_is_not_a_season_exclusive_skin_for_the/) 

Now the next argument is a follow up to this and people claim ""It's part of the season two theme and therefore it's exclusive"". Yet agian I don't belive so since on the first day of season four the Leviathan was in the shop and it's part of the Space explorer kit.

3. If Epic game was aware that the skin would never comeback, why not just put it in the battlepass? This could be answerd by ""they want to make money"" well if they want to make money why not just bring it back? Plus it had only appeard in season 2 and if they wanted it to be a season 2 exclusive why not add it into the battlepass.

Before I play devils advocate I'd like to show my interaction with Loomin.

*Processing img ed768jppl8x01...*

If it wouldn't com back then I think Loomin would have said no, note that to my knowledge I don't think Loomin has anything to do with the skins so he might not be the most reliable source \(however I do belive what he said before about the red knight not being a season exclusive skin\).

The only thing that makes me thing that it wont comeback is that it hasn't been in the store for a really long time.

To summarise I personally hope and think it will comeback and if we ever see the dark vanguard in the shop agian then I am 100&amp;#37; sure that we will see the red knight again as the dark vanguard was the red knight of season 3.

Let mer hear what you think about if the red knight will ever comeback and I hope you found this helpfull.",FortNiteBR

I think they shouldn't bring it back even though I want it. It would ruin the originality and too many people would have it. Also if they do add it I don't think the people from season 1 would be happy. Let me know what you guys think.

Dear community,
I am a 24 year old Economics student that has been always passionate about gaming. I have played Cod4 promod for almost ten year straight and just recently i gave Fortnite a chance, falling in love with it immediately. However, little over a month ago, i have been kicked out during a match and i couldn't play ever since. I tried to contact the support but with no success. This is my last shot at having my matter resolved.
I am attaching the text of the emails i have sent and received from the support for you to better understand the situation. I am sorry for the long post.

**First Email:**
To the Fortnite support team,

This is the second time I try to get to you and hopefully this time I can get a proper response.
Should you need it, the first case ID was #3345***.

As I previously told you on April 10th, 2018 I have been kicked out from a game due to Internet lag, DNS, or cheating.
The problem here is that I did not, nor I do now, have any third party tools installed on my pc that could interfere with the game. 
The PC i use for gaming is only used for that purpose and for some other university related work. Having recently formatted my pc, the only softwares I had installed at the time were:
-Adobe Suite
-Office Suite
-Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
-Epic Games Launcher
-Fortnite
-Spotify
-Teamspeak 3
-Discord
-uTorrent
-SpeedFan
I can't see how the game even detected a false positive! I strongly believe that a mistake has been committed. 
I don't care about the account itself, i don't seek a compensation for this unfair ban either. I would just really like to be able to play the game again since it is the first game in years that I truly enjoy playing, more importantly, I have never broken any rules.
This includes using cheating software, using DNS softwares, being disrespectful to another player, teaming in solo mode. Nothing. My conduct has been immaculate for the whole duration of my experience in Your game.
I was a paying user. While I don't believe being a paying user should qualify me to a different treatment, it qualifies me as a customer of your company. The treatment I am receiving is absolutely unfair, and I would really like if you could take my ban under examination and possibly lift it.

Should you need more information please feel free to ask me.


**Epic's response**
Hello Luca,

Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support. 

Upon carefully reviewing, you have been observed using Cheats to gain an advantage against other players in Fortnite. One of our primary goals here at Epic is to foster a healthy and cooperative community for Fortnite. For this reason, this type of behavior is not tolerated.

Due to the nature of your infraction, A permanent ban has been placed on your Epic Account.

Any External Accounts linked to the now banned Epic Account will not be removed. This means you will not be able to link your External Account with any other Epic Accounts.

If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.

**My last email**
Dear James,

Thanks for the kind reply.
However if I truly had cheated i would not have gone through the hustle of writing multiple lenghty e-mails and contacted the support in the first place.
I am well aware that you believe that my account is suspected of having used forbidden softwares to gain advantage on other players.
The reason i emailed the support is that I know that this is a hundred percent a mistake. I don't even know how to put it under different words.

Please get back to me with a non-standardized reply and let's have a real conversation with a real Epic's employee. I am more than willing to give you all the information to prove to you that i did not ever use any forbidden softwares.
I know that this is not a proof, but just from taking a look at my stats, it is blatant that the activity of my account doesn't reflect any type of cheating. Please use some common sense.

I'm hoping to hear from you as soon as possible with a proper response.

Yours faithfully,

Luca ***

Well, how do you get the ad revenue lined up AND continue to give back to the player community in the way that has made Epic so Epic?

FRANCHISE-SPONSORED POINTS OF INTEREST
Burger King, McDonald's, Subway, Chevron, Pizza Hut, AMC, Sears, Target, Etc, etc.  For a limited time, a POI gets re-skinned in the sponsor's logos and color theme AND, most importantly, coupons spawn out of the chests there.  Drop Burger King (Greasy Grove) and you might find a coupon for a free Double Whopper meal in a chest.  When you pick it up, a coupon is sent to your Epic account.  

I'm pretty sure the player base isn't going to tolerate brand logos and shit popping up in our games (which has become an increasing thing in games in general), but if we are getting swag in the process, we might like it a lot.

Imagine a week where the main store in Retail Row is a Target and you can find Target ""gift cards"" in the chests.  Or maybe you can find a rare skin or back bling.  

I'm sure there will be many more character LTM's in the near future.  Just pointing out the opportunity POI's have.  You know all these gamers be eaten' dem za's and chicky nugz.

What this patch does is it spreads players further apart by creating a larger circle. This way your chances of getting shot in the back are much slimmer, but if Thanos comes your way you will have to face him alone.

So Epic nerfed Thanos and gave players better weapons so he can be taken out in 1v1 battles. 

The problem with these changes is it still doesn’t create the scenario where players team up to fight Thanos as shown in the trailer for this mode. 

Instead they balanced Thanos to only be slightly more powerful than a normal player. Making the game just a normal match of Fortnite with one random player having a slight advantage...

Half the time I end up with a wall that's so far away from where I'm actually standing, it's not even relevant to helping me, and it wastes materials. Other times, it feels like I can't get the object to actually build where i'm looking, and I have to wiggle around to find the sweet spot for it to build.

It's really frustrating, because I want to get better at building so I can actually win fights that involve it, but I can never get my structures in the right place. Any advice. ",FortNiteBR

Unless you're fortunate enough to get a GeForce Now Beta code, or own one of the few Mac models that can run the game, you're completely out of luck. And even if the game is playable on your Mac, it runs at low settings with frequent bugs and glitches -- even after using time-intensive methods like Bootcamp.


There are many people out there, myself included, who would love to play this game, but cannot because we only own a Mac or Macbook. Given how great of a job Epic has done porting this game to mobile devices, it seems that the developers can and should develop a port that makes Fortnite playable for OSX users.

We enjoy something, you nerf it. We ask for reversal and you double down, nerfing Thanos again. His jump feels like it takes longer, his laser is still useless against anyone who builds and if anyone sneezes on him with a LMG from 40 feet away he dies. Nobody asked for a nerf, let alone a second one. We asked for the sky bridge endgame “exploit” to be fixed yet that still exists.

I thought this mode was fun, and it was, until you made it terrible by making the most sought-after part a joke. I always want to get the Gauntlet but now it’s “more” fun to play the soldier because Thanos really isn’t a threat or rewarding outside the first minute or two. But at least now anyone with a LMG and 10-second reaction time can get a “fair turn” to play as him.

I’m not the only one who feels this way. You say you listen and respond to player feedback, yet it seems your actions reflect the opposite. I want to be wrong.",FortNiteBR

This gets incredibly frustrating as once you kill someone or finish off a team, there is a very high chance another team was just watching or waiting and came to finish you off. This tactic being so efficient is bad for the game as it incentivises it and is not fun for many teams.

My idea is a buff called: Adrenaline Rush.

You get the buff by killing a person or wiping a team (in which case all of your teammates gets the buff).

The effect of Adrenaline Rush would only be that you can use health and shield items faster; somewhere between 1-2x faster. This would help recovery and not be an overpowered buff meant to kill.

The buff would help not in deterring the tactic of running in after a battle, but to help the team that has just won the battle reset and get ready for another fight.

Buff visuals could include: Energy flowing around the health bars, or your body pulses and acts like an x-ray image on your body (only you can see it).

The first reaction of the average Thanos player when being shot at is to jump to safety. The jump takes 2 seconds to load. A good player will give you the easiest 6 heashots in a row he has ever had. That is 432 damage. Thanos now has just 268 hp left. No shields.

The first thing he will try to do when he lands is to attack you. But with the amount of jump pads you have at your disposal in this mode you can easily just jump away. 

Thanos is slow as FUCK. He has to jump to get close to you since the laser doesn’t have infinite range. He‘ll load his jump, during which a decent player will, again, shoot Thanos. And that’s it. Thanos dead. That’s 99% of all Thanos 1v1‘s I has and I won about 99% of those. 

It’s ridiculous how weak he is. I get why Epic did it, so he dies faster and therefore can be used by more players in a single round. But be honest: Who really wants to use him anymore?

When there are ~15 people left (all decent) literally NO ONE will go for the gauntlet. Being Thanos in the mode about Thanos is a DISADVANTAGE. Let that sink in.

Thanos needs a HUGE buff. He was good when the mode first came out but even that is too weak IMO.

With Season 4 however, in order to unlock certain pieces of a character you need to reach a specific character level, most notably character level 80 in order to get the full armor piece + LED for the tier 100 character. Do you guys think this should be incorporated in future battlepasses? Do you think that there should be double exp events / double exp weekends considering not everyone is able to play a lot but want that awesome character level 80 gear. In my opinion I think it's a great addition that their is some use to the level of your character, but if every battlepass onwards has such high character level requirement then it'll be a struggle to juggle a job, school, etc while aiming to level up your character to X level to acquire pieces of equipment. Also, this can be faster to level up to 80 if you have a squad w/ battlepasses as well or even duo's, but if you're mostly a solo player like me, leveling will be a long grind, and if my squad is available then EXP will be a lot easier as we are irl friends and have a pretty solid win rate in squads 15-20%",FortNiteBR

When you snipe and then land a shot on a guy so he is one shot, but then the next 6 miss cause of bloom it is extremely frustrating.

There is FSA, but it now takes a very long time to reset, and you have to stand still, exposing yourself to get sniped, which is very likely to happen, so most of the time its better to just slow tap without letting FSA fully kick in. This can result in the bloom RNG though that I believe takes some of the skill out.

The only issue i can see with having no bloom is that snipers might feel too weak, but I do not think that would be the case as long as falloff damage is still in the game, because a single sniper knock or shot on someone can let you push, landing one or two shots with an AR from a distance doesnt have nearly the same effect. 

Removing bloom would let the person who actually aims better win the fight rather than rely on the bloom RNG to laser them down.

One of the worst examples I have seen of this was a week or so ago when I got 4 headshot from like 20-30m by a tac smg and my shots just outlined the guy while he was standing still, even though I had a green AR.

TL;DR Bloom removes some skill from the game and without it good aim would be more rewarding without relying on the luck of bloom RNG to land multiple consecutive shots. ",FortNiteBR

Given that we have millions of players, many with Twitch glory in their eyes, the community has developed the skill level disparities typical of game like Overwatch. However, because there's no ranking system, we're getting thrown together in one giant mess, and it's not fair for any of the players. Here's how the typical game for me works: basically, I'll squash people out of the gate, which is probably extremely frustrating for them, and leave the starting place with 3-4 kills (provided, of course, I don't die in the initial struggle). Then, in the final round of the game, I'll inevitably get out constructed and annihilated by someone many times my skill level. 

Different skill levels are a fact of life. I like playing Fortnite, but it's not fun when it feels impossible to win. And, at this point, I'm realizing the only way I could even win is if I got super lucky.

**Thanos Changes**

* Increased Beam from 12 to 20 damage on players.
* Increased Punch damage from 80 to 100.
* Decreased health from 800 to 500.

**General Mode Changes**

* Reduced height of the Bus when dropping
* Bigger initial storm circle
* Less storm damage early game (first 3 storms from 5%/5%/10% per tick to 1%/2.5%/5%)
* Initial Gauntlet spawn time changed from bus ride plus 30-45s to bus ride plus 120-135s
* Increased spawn rate of Med Kits, Chug Jugs and Big Shields.
* Removed spawn of Bandages and Slurp Juice.

I was at the back of the map on the hill across from tomato town stalking the thanos and this park ranger guy while wondering where the final 2 were. After getting off the top of the hill i noticed across from me on the other side of tomato town on the hill there was a port a fort and 2 players named Ardauz and MaryPoppinThots popping shots at the thanos and park ranger.

The thanos in question left the park ranger alone and proceeded to attack the two players but they killed him and one took the glove. Luckly the park ranger killed the one player and then thanos while he was in the storm or i would have been in a 2v1. Normally i would have reported the players but i ended up winning the game by using something ninja would do often for the first time. An impulse grenade on the floor and shotgunning the guy in a 2 wall high base so i was so excited i forgot. After that i decided to check the replay and got better perspectives on said players as you can see in my imgur link. https://imgur.com/a/sF52gy1

First i wanna say that i understand that people think you should be allowed to team against thanos i understand that point but the issue here is not that after they killed thanos one player took the glove and they started working together and were searching for us to win the game thats what i meant when i said teaming. If they took down thanos then fought each other i would not care but fighting another player and thanos at the same time is impossible not to mention by epics rules its still teaming lol.

So, similar to my previous events, I want this one to be grand. If you guys want to see what the community can pull off again, please help us out by upvoting this post. I’d like to keep these events exclusive to the reddit community of this game as it isn’t as toxic and we’ve pulled of some great things before. Read below for all the details on this event! This all for us to have a good time and have some fun as a community :)

**The Great Wall of Sprays**

**Objective**: We’re going to destroy every single tree at Wailing Woods. Once every tree in the general location is gone, we’ll start building a *massive* wall (it can start anywhere, but every wall piece has to be connected). Absolutely *no* outlying wall pieces, connect every piece so it looks like a massive wall and *not* a maze. The wall will only be one unit high, not two, not three, *one*. Once we have a decent sized wall, every single person in the lobby will start spray painting any choice of spray onto the wall, so that it looks like a huge graffiti wall. You only have the ability to use three sprays, so use them wisely ;)

**Landing Location**: *Wailing Woods*

**Queueing Server/Mode**: *Oceania* (Solos)

**Date**: Thursday May 10th, 2018

**Queueing Time(s)**: 6:00 PM *Pacific Time* + Every Fifteen minutes after (6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00)

**Platform**: Once again, this event will be across *all* platforms

**Rules**:

Shooting is once again, *not* allowed.

If anyone does start shooting; griefing or trolling the event, immediately charge &amp; execute them by working together and pickaxing them.

Absolutely *no* griefing by building. This includes building pyramids/floors/stairs that have absolutely no correlation to the event. Please, to make the experience for everyone, do *not* build anything besides the wall.

No destroying of the wall, we want it to go fast so we can spray paint it ASAP.

**Participation Requirements**: 

Because you need to have the battle pass in order to have sprays, every person participating will already have the Carbide skin. Preferably, equip the Teknique skin as is matches the theme of the event, but if you don’t have the Teknique skin unlocked yet you can still use the Carbide Skin with any back bling/glider/pickaxe. All you need to have equipped is either the Teknique or Carbide skin so that we can tell who the players who are participating are.

And that’s it for the rules! If you want to see this all unfold, please upvote this post so that we can make it happen and get as much people attending the event as possible. We have exactly 3 Hours and 15 minutes after this post goes up to get as much upvotes as possible so we can have as much attendance as possible.

I *will* be streaming this as I always do on my [Twitch](twitch.tv/Sqoof) for everyone who wants to watch it all go down. Fortnite Reddit Community, let’s get it done!

Once the event is over, feel free to post about it on the sub and send some clips/images to me over on my Twitter (@xsqoof) I’ll be making a massive collection of all our community events. Feel free to also share some ideas for future events in the replies of this post or via my Twitter DMs. You can also share your thoughts in my Twitch chat when I go live as I’m really interactive with chat as well. Thank you all for reading, let’s get this going!

Solo Wins could gift you.
1-5 battle pass tiers
10-25 vbucks (you get 25 for simple missions in STW)
A seasonal pickaxe and/or backbling
And the battle pass itself for perhaps 10-25 solo wins

There is no doubt that your first solo win is a satisfying feeling but when your constantly winning games it feels worthless apart from a number on your stats.

So to prevent that from happening I propose this. 

If you get downed by an enemy and eliminated, and your teammate is either able to eliminate that team fully from the game, then you respawn into the game with 30 health. This can only be the case if you and your squad/duo partner were able to eliminate the enemies of the other team without any other teams assistance. 

For example, lets say you get game ended at Tilted and your teammate is at Anarchy, if the people who killed you end up dying from another squad, you will not be entered back into the game because your team had nothing to do with the death of the enemy players. 

There would obviously be a lot of variables that would have to be worked out, but this would be a neat addition to eliminate the thirst kill.",FortNiteBR

Add me as a friend

Play a match \(We don't have to win, it's just that I have to play with a friend\)

Then unfriend me if you want.

I'll PM you my name if you're willing to play. \(BTW I don't have a mic, but it's only one match\)

There were a couple of things to account for

**Weekly Challenges**
Each week there are four 5 star, 500 xp challenged and three 10 star 1000xp challenges. After you complete half of the challenges you get a 5000 xp bonus

**Daily Challenges**
Every day you get a Challenge worth 5 battle pass stars and 500 xp

**Weekly Recap**
In a standard week, not accounting for game time xp, you will earn 13,500 xp and 85 stars for challenges ONLY

**Leveling**
This is where shit got complicated. The leveling system took a minute to figure out, but after looking at literally hundreds of picture of season 4 starting lobbies we estimated the level requirements as follows

1-100
2-200
3-300
4-400
5-500
6-600
7-700
8-800
9-900
10-1000
11-1100
12-1200
13-1300
14-1400
**15**-1550
16-1700
(and each requirement grows by 150 after that)

So using only challenges an no game time or xp bonus, the level system looks like this:


**Week** | **XP** | **Stars** | **Level** | **Level Based Stars** | **Tier**
----|--|-----|-----|-----------------|----
**Week** | **XP** | **Stars** | **Level** | **Level Based Stars** | **Tier**
1 | 13500 | 85 | 15 | 44 | 12
2 | 13500 | 85 | 21 | 20 | 23
3 | 13500 | 85 | 26 | 13 | 33
4 | 13500 | 85 | 30 | 16 | 43
5 | 13500 | 85 | 33 | 6 | 52
6 | 13500 | 85 | 36 | 9 | 61
7 | 13500 | 85 | 39 | 6 | 70
8 | 13500 | 85 | 41 | 12 | 80
9 | 13500 | 85 | 43 | 4 | 89
**10** | 13500 | 85 | **46** | 14 | **99**

**Required XP**
Based on a few different sources, it takes 403,300 XP to reach level 80 from the beginning. Adding up all the XP in the chart accounts for 135,000 XP, leaving you with 268,300 XP that you need to earn on your own.

**Variables**
One of the bigger problems is that I can't see what the future challenges are. So since a fair amount of requirements involve kills, there is additional xp you will be earning while also using the challenge. In order to account for that, I used a higher match score as an average than I normally would've

**Average Game Info**
A breakdown of ingame xp rewards can be found https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8gwknm/how_much_xp_are_you_really_earning_sorry_for_the/ courtesy of /u/opal-snake 

Using this I chose to set a 6 minute, 1 kill, and top 25 game, which gives you roughly 150 xp per game.

**Weekly Requirements**
Given that you need to earn 268,300 XP by yourself to reach level 80, you have to earn an average of 26,830 xp a week. However, since as you level up there is an xp bonus added, it gets easier and easier to hit that quota. For example, by buying the battle pass you are given a 50% xp boost, so 10 average games a day will only get you 15,750 xp for the week. a few weeks later, when you hit 100%, the bonus helps you to get well over 30,000 xp. This is the long way of saying don't stress if you don't hit these numbers until week 4/5.

**Missing calculations**
One thing left out was the fact that some battle pass tiers five you 1000 xp, so there is an additional 5000 XP rewarded as you level up.

**TL;DR**
Basically is a complicated system that changes week by week, but if you play 70 games a week with an average score of 150 per game (you can track your last 7 days stats on fortnitetracker.com) you should end up with the omega suit with two weeks to spare

**Note**
I'm a polisci major so it's possible that some of the math and estimations could be off, but this is the closest i could account for

So I've decided to create a survey for the community here on r/FortNiteBR to be able to involve everyone. This survey is based on your satisfaction with Fortnite in numerous ways from balance, cosmetics, modes and much more. The data from everyone's responses will be posted here to the subreddit. You do not have to answer every single question also! The survey is completely anonymous and will show us some really informative insight into the community and how we all feel about certain topics within Fortnite. With this data we can hope to see some good changes within Fortnite as well. I had done this sort of survey previously within the Smite community and actually was able to get in contact with the community team there to relay the information and we actually were able to see some changes the community had been hoping for. 

Also, as a big thank you to everyone for helping out I will be doing a V Bucks giveaway. There will be a question to type in your Reddit username or your email address so that you can be entered to win. The link is below and thank you everyone for your help!

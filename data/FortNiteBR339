4,Zanch_,1525979772,8ihgda,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ihgda/keyboard_mouse_on_console_is_op/,5,Keyboard &amp; Mouse on Console is OP,"As a console player during seasons 1 &amp; 2, I got pretty good with the controller. I took a break season 3 and in that time, got my PC. I started playing mouse and keyboard on PC and went through the grueling process of finding the correct hotkeys, figuring aim sensitivity, etc. I would like to believe I‚Äôm a little above average on the PC servers. 

Then I remembered that console wasn‚Äôt supporting keyboard and mouse well back when I was playing, so I plugged in my keyboard and mouse so see how it‚Äôs changed and they‚Äôre almost parallel. 

The only difference is that console players have aim assist, which persists when you plug in a keyboard and mouse on console... 

Not sure if I‚Äôm the only one to point this out, but I feel it‚Äôs unfair. There‚Äôs already the advantage with hotkeys (In my opinion) and then we also get AIM ASSIST?! 

Please return your thoughts on the matter! 

Thank you ",FortNiteBR

you might remember me from the [announcement post from a couple of days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8hh1a8/want_to_win_prizes_for_completing_ingame/) for a project I'm involved in. If you want to know more about that in specific feel free to check out the other thread.

I am here again because we have a pretty big problem that we unfortunately cannot resolve, only Epic can. When we released the site we pretty much assumed that it is possible to share Replays of games played on console - **unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case**. I myself do not own a console so I am unable to look further into this, but from what people have told me, theres no way to export replay files on console.

Seeing how the game on console runs off the same engine and code branch, console replays should 100% be compatible to be played back on PC, if only it was possible to export them. Implementing a way to do so should be a pretty easy addition from what I can tell and **would not just benefit us, but many others as well** (Say, editors).

I've tagged three Epic devs in my original post regarding this concern but unfortunately have not received a response: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8hh1a8/want_to_win_prizes_for_completing_ingame/dyk7ylq/?context=4

Thank you for your time, hopefully this gets enough attention for Epic to see it.

Right now, you have four things you can accomplish, multiplied three times by the three different ""materials."" Those would be:

* Slopes (stairs)

* Roofing and flooring (flat)

* Roofing (pyramidal)

* Walls

And the materials are

* Wood

* Brick

* Steel

There can be infinite interpretations provided the right imagination works them over, but the truth is that the game suffers because of a lack of ingenuity in the building department. 

I understand the suggestions below would be difficult to implement, so I will spare everyone the other two materials and focus on wood.

# Wood

Wood is in dire need of a rework. In a game beset by fantasy elements, it shouldn't be the harvesting of supplies that breaks my immersion. Yet, every time I hit a fence with my pickaxe and receive the same type of wood as when I hit a tree--well, that isn't going to cut it, no pun intended.

The major overhaul wood needs is a quality redistribution. Please refer to the following wood grades, which I have truncated into what would fit with Fortnite's gameplay.

| Grade   | Min. Board Width/Length    | Surface area clear |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| First and Seconds |  6""/8'  | 91% firsts 83% seconds    
| Select       | 4""/6'|  90% clear one side
| No. 1 Common | 3""/4' | 75% clear face
| No. 2 Common | 3""/4'| 50% clear face
| No.  3 Common | 3""/4' | and-so-on

There is another grade called ""sound wormy,"" which is an interruption of No 1. Common with wormholes. If you did not understand the chart, understand this: as the grade increases, the clean surface area of the wood decreases and its minimum board width/length decreases. 

In real life, the let-down rate and severity is determined by the type of tree the lumber was obtained from. Let's go over wood resources not obtained from trees:

| Entity 'Mined'   | Received Grade    |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Fences       | Farmland: No. 1 Grade, Suburban/City: Select. Select's disadvantage comes from a smaller cut meaning you wouldn't use it to cover acres.
| Wooden Palettes | No. 3 Common. Fun fact, hardwoods typically go to grade 2 before becoming sound wormy grade and have no third grade. |
| Wooden houses | We can say, fictionally, these homes yield a combination of No. 2 lumber and a heavyset timber described in the next part
| Chests | Chests will yield nothing because the common grade used to make it has been broken down past its use, or 'splintered.'

*****

For the sake of gameplay we can describe lumber as *human* and timber as *wild.* Timber will generally be thicker, more heavyset, and the closest in interpretation to the walls constructed right now. 

Here are my new categories: 

| Wood type  | Pros | Cons
|:-----------:|:------------:||:-:|
| High quality lumber | No gaps, decent HP, can be broken for LQ Lumber | Slow building speed, expensive, makes smaller constructs
| Low quality lumber | Fast building speed, great starting HP | no refund, has gaps you can get hit through
| High quality timber | No gaps, ridiculous starting HP, thick | terrible HP growth
| Low quality timber | Plentiful in the environment | Falls apart, has gaps, terrible HP

**Right now,** any wood you have in your inventory is made into this offensively basic motley of wooden planks. Let me list the problems. 

* The wood has no markings. Is this premium wood? How did the player get premium lumber from hitting a tree?

* Leaves strewn throughout. Even when I farm only man-made materials, I get leaves. That is not acceptable. 

* Ropes are used to keep certain segments from splintering. Guess the magic fingers that can get premium wood from a fir tree cannot build a wall right. Also, where does the rope come from? What did I hit to obtain finished nylon product?!

* Wood is bolted on sideways to provide similar support to the ropes. Why are there ropes at all? Why not just the wood? 

Here is my address of each issue. 

* I made it so that players who land in hospitable areas and 'mine' manmade materials are able to make high quality forts. Walls built with lumber should be smooth, only lightly wormholed or marked, and not require as many supports. Even low quality stuff, although it splinters--this makes lumber a very limited resource in the late game. 

* Only have leaves strewn inside if the player characters mines wood from low quality trees in places that have high humidity, or if they mine wood from smaller, immature trees. Otherwise, high quality lumber ought to just be logs laid out vertically. 

* No ropes. 

* Only low quality iterations should have makeshift solutions for a makeshift supply.

When I wanted a change of pace from the other modes with less of a sense of pressure I could chill out in it.

It also gave the game much more of a community spirit because there was a whole team of players to interact with. Lots of impromtu dance parties and lovely moments of people sharing loot or saving each other. It was also loads of fun to reinforce &amp; trick out defensive structures for my allies as a combat engineer if I wanted to.

It was also cool to see how pro\-tier people would go full Solid Snake and dive into enemy territory to see how long they could last, or when last\-man\-standing guys would pull off victories in spite of being surrounded on all sides.

50s also let newer players get more familiar with the map, building, and not die immediately whenever they drop.

50 v 50 v2 added a lot of dimensions to an already great game that feel like they always should have been there.  I look forward to 50 v 50 v3 and 50 v 50 eventually becoming a permanent play mode in the game.",FortNiteBR

I've noticed over the past couple days this rare bug occurring a little more often than usual, so I decided to investigate.

Essentially the basis of what happened\- in a build battle with a guy, I'm using 2 pump shotguns, I fire one and get a hit marker and no damage, then switch to the other and get a head shot for 144. After comparing the replay theater and my recording from OBS, I noticed a subtle difference\-on my OBS recording the shot fired and landed, but did no damage*\(I did get a hit marker and the shot should've been a 95 body shot as the entire spread nailed him in the chest\)*, whereas on the replay in\-game, the shot was never fired at all. 

So, my best guess when sniper shots or pump shotgun shots don't register damage, it's server communication issues. From what I can tell, on my screen it's firing and landing the shot but not on their screen or server\-side. This is because in\-game replays are saved on a replay server, not recorded like OBS does. So where OBS records my screen, the replay theater records what happens on EPIC's servers. 

Hopefully this clarifies to everyone whose had this issue what's going on, and maybe this helps EPIC find a solution to the problem, although I'm sure they already have figured out this is the problem.

Let us console players match (or be close to) the speed of PC building/Editing through improvements to the building pro configuration or adding an entirely new configuration! Please comment with more suggestions!

Building Sensitivity: 
This would allow us to whip around like Myth while we are building. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúraise your sensitivity‚Äù I play on 8 X+Y and it still feels REALLY slow. Not having this bothers me the most, it would be a HUGE quality of life improvement. Note: You can
CHOOSE the Sensitivity, so if you don‚Äôt want to change it you don‚Äôt have to.

Building Pro Button improvements:
After playing for a while, I‚Äôve noticed 2 Flaws with building pro: The time between selecting and placing your pieces is inconsistent, slow, and glitchy and It is hard to place traps during combat, because you have to take your finger off the stick completely to select and place the trap. To FULLY address the Switch-Place Issue, I believe that it should be taken out. RT/R2 should just be for Placing and Turbo Building. Which leaves walls unmapped, to fix this, the buttons have to be completely rearranged. My idea for this is to switch the pickaxe to Y/Triangle ‚ÄúHOLD‚Äù, which now frees up the Y/Triangle ‚ÄúTap‚Äù, so now there are 4 buttons: LT/L2, LB/L1, RB/R1, and Y/Triangle ‚ÄúTap‚Äù that allow for the 4 building pieces to be mapped to their own buttons.

Instant Edit
I know this hasn‚Äôt been brought up a lot, but right now we have to Hold B to edit things and it feels like it takes 10 minutes to pull up the edit mode. My idea for instant Editing (this is on PC  already) which is super easy to implement: Press LB+RB (L1 + R1) at the same time while looking at the structure you want to edit. This can work in both combat and build mode and is super easy to implement!

Editing Aim Assist:
(This is when you get stuck trying to edit some things) Take it out, it is completely unnecessary and it impairs our ability to edit.

TL;DR: Building Sensitivity, Even quicker building in build mode, and Instant Editing, and remove edit aim assist ",FortNiteBR

In season 3 instead we had good skins when the tiers went up \(elite agent, dark voyager, ecc..\) the theme was solid and at the same price. I think that Epic has became more of an industry of money than a gaming developer, they started with worth skins for the time spent but now that they've seen that the players play anyway they put the good skins for 2000 V\-Bucks and the trash ones in the Battle Pass.

We should all love the C4.,"This weapon gets a lot of unnecessary hate. The C4 can be *extremely* useful if you use it the right way.

The main complaints are that it doesn't do enough damage, the damage it does do doesn't have enough splash, it can't be thrown far, is relatively slow to deploy, and you can't detonate while holding another gun.

All of these flaws add up to the C4 being pretty shitty as a grenade, or even as a trap

The C4 is not useless though. It fucking **shines** as a breaching charge, or for base demolition.

At the bottom of an enemies tower? C4 that bitch.

In a house fight? C4 everywhere, that opponent won't be ready when the walls come down.

I understand not wanting to give up an inventory slot for the C4, but I *often* take it over grenades and it almost always pays off.

Breaking through a wall with a pickaxe is loud, slow, and highly visible. C4 on the other hand is instantaneous. It's outstanding for breach and clearing enemies holed up in a building.

My idea is that when some one has already got a shotgun in their inventory and picks up a second one, the second shotgun that is picked up should be greyed out and should not be able to be equipped. The only reasons that someone has two shotguns in there inventory are either they are carrying it for a friend, carrying it to stop someone else getting it, or to double shotgun. So simply if they make it so that the second shotgun cannot be equipped then the only person it will detriment is the double shotgunners.
TLDR: Make it that the second shotgun that has been picked up cannot be equipped.

I only had that happen when I was going for headshots at a range that wasn't basically point blank.

If you aim at the head in the center of your crosshair at like 7-10 meters, look at the amount of the other players hitbox in your entire crosshair and you'll realize something. What's the chance of more than like 2 pellets hitting that guy?

Basically, even the proposed change for consistent pellet placement wouldn't solve this issue because barely any of the other player is in your crosshair and available to get hit when you shoot in the first place.

So basically, when you get a 9dmg pump going for a headshot, it's not because you got extremely unlucky, or a glitch happened, if anything you'd get lucky to do more than that due to the wide spread of the shotgun and considering how small a players head is.

I think it's safe to say that most people, including huge names on twitch, are taking the pump over tacs, heavies, and tac smgs. 

It just doesn't make any sense to me how the pump is incredibly common, yet it is capable of doing over 200 damage. How is gun that can found in literally every single location on the map going to have the ability to one shot people. This isn't call of duty or halo, every death is incredibly significant, and I don't think any guy besides the sniper should be able to one shot a player. 

I just got done playing for about two hours, and I would say about 5-10 of my deaths were from being one shot but the pump when I had health anywhere from 100-200. I can not be the only one who the thinks the pump needs a nerf in damage. Yeah you can say just build or its high risk/high reward but I'm going to say neither of the those are good counters to my argument. Make it an actual rare gun and I would be totally fine with it being as powerful as it is. I just feel like every single player on the map should not be able to have the best gun in the game.

This is gamebreaking when affected. [Detailed Post]","Essentially, you're unable to see your teammates on both the minimap and the full-sized map. This can put you at a severe disadvantage, because unless you look around you and scan for your teammates, you have no idea where they are. If you don't have LOS, it's especially bad because you may not know where they are at ALL.

This bug has been prevalent for quite a few updates now, and is sad to see it hasn't been fixed.

You can find examples in [this imgur album](https://imgur.com/gallery/hYBPTSF) or you can click the direct links below.

* [Evidence 1](https://i.imgur.com/WHkuGc2.png)
* [Evidence 2](https://i.imgur.com/76OVDd3.png)

Some details about this bug: 

* In our group of friends, this only occurs to users on PC who have the game installed on their SSDs. 
* However, in a previous post about this bug, an XBOX user said he faces the same issues.
* Reinstalling the game does **NOT** fix this issue.
* This issue occurs in most squad and duo games, but will occasionally not occur.
* When this bug occurs, you will not be able to see your teammates in the lobby either. 
* Most of the time, you will not hear the teammate jump sound from the battlebus.

Possible theory: Loading in faster than your teammates causes the game to not display those teammates on your minimap.

Reasoning: Often, when loading in faster than teammates, their names will not show in the top left until they connect fully.

In reality, I believe Epic has the tools to fix this. I'm not sure exactly since when this has been an issue for us but I know it's before season 4. I believe somewhere halfway through season 3.

I hope you guys can see how difficult it can be to deal with this bug at times. It's super annoying, and I hope we can get it fixed.

Personally, I think it makes sense. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get thanos at the beginning of the game, even though he is overpowered (as he should be, it‚Äôs a gauntlet) you‚Äôre probably not going to win the game for the fact that he doesn‚Äôt regenerate health, only shield, meaning most likely at some point you have to defeat him in order to get it and get the win, rather than just finding it at the beginning. In addition, everyone has an even chance of getting him and killing him, so I don‚Äôt have a problem with it counting as solo wins, but I know some do. ",FortNiteBR

191,slutflakes,1525928132,8icdj4,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8icdj4/the_pump_shotgun_problem/,7,The Pump Shotgun Problem,"Alright, so we all love the pump shotgun.  It is our friend.  It is our life sometimes.  But its damage is out of control.  Dying to fall damage is disappointing, dying to a sniper is frustrating, but dying at 100 Shield/100 Health to one shot from a pump shotgun is infuriating.  There literally is no counterplay.  The opponent can just spin around, get lucky, and your dead.  How are you supposed to prevent that when you are less than 5ft from the opponent?  Is there anything that you can do if you do not kill him before he gets ***one*** shot off?  I'm totally fine with it doing 185-90 damage, as it is a shotgun to the face, but being at 100 Shield/100 Health should be special.  It should allow you the most protection possible in the game.  The only gun that should be able to kill you in one shot from this point should be the bolt action sniper rifle.  The pump action is basically a close range sniper rifle.  No other shotgun has more than 200 maximum damage but the pump shotgun.  No other weapon has over 200 maximum damage except the bolt action sniper rifle and the hunting rifle.  By reducing the maximum damage on the pump shotgun to 185-90, this will be the case.  If I'm running through a field and get sniped, I'm like, ""Good Shot"".  If I get killed by a trap, I'm like, ""Well shouldn't have run in there"".  If I'm 100 Shield/100 Health and someone kills me with one shot from a pump shotgun, I'm discouraged from even playing the game.  By reducing the damage, the pump shotgun becomes a less deadly weapon to those that have managed their health but not those who haven't.  However, those that survive are only given a brief second or two to retaliate while the opponent has to switch weapons.  185-90 damage still probably kills 90% of the players in any game.  This means that most of the pump shotguns play will be unchanged.  Everyone will still shoot once and switch to another weapon.  Just my two cents.

TL:DR - Reduce the pump shotgun maximum damage so that it doesn't kill you in one shot when you have 100 Shield/100 Health.   ",FortNiteBR

So, similar to my previous events, I want this one to be grand. If you guys want to see what the community can pull off again, please help us out by upvoting this post. I‚Äôd like to keep these events exclusive to the reddit community of this game as it isn‚Äôt as toxic and we‚Äôve pulled of some great things before. Read below for all the details on this event &amp; as this is our first official *Community Queue Night* This all for us to have a good time and have some fun as a community :)

**The Great Wall of Sprays**

**Landing Location**: *Wailing Woods*

**Queueing Server/Mode**: *Oceania* (Solos)

**Queueing Time(s)**: 6:00 PM *Pacific Time* + Every Fifteen minutes after (6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00)

**Platform**: Once again, this event will be across *all* platforms

**Objective**: We‚Äôre going to destroy every single tree at Wailing Woods. Once every tree in the general location is gone, we‚Äôll start building a *massive* wall (it can start anywhere, but every wall piece has to be connected). Absolutely *no* outlying wall pieces, connect every piece so it looks like a massive wall and *not* a maze. The wall will only be one unit high, not two, not three, *one*. Once we have a decent sized wall, every single person in the lobby will start spray painting any choice of spray onto the wall, so that it looks like a huge graffiti wall. You only have the ability to use three sprays, so use them wisely ;)

**Rules**:

Shooting is once again, *not* allowed.

If anyone does start shooting; griefing or trolling the event, immediately charge &amp; execute them by working together and pickaxing them.

Absolutely *no* griefing by building. This includes building pyramids/floors/stairs that have absolutely no correlation to the event. Please, to make the experience for everyone, do *not* build anything besides the wall.

No destroying of the wall, we want it to go fast so we can spray paint it ASAP.

**Participation Requirements**: 

Because you need to have the battle pass in order to have sprays, every person participating will already have the Carbide skin. Equip the Carbide Skin with any back bling/glider/pickaxe. All you need to have equipped is the Carbide skin so that we can tell who the players who are participating are.

And that‚Äôs it for the rules! If you want to see this all unfold, please upvote this post so that we can make it happen and get as much people attending the event as possible. We have exactly 21 Hours after this post goes up to get as much upvotes as possible so we can have as much attendance as possible.

I *will* be streaming this as I always do on my [Twitch](twitch.tv/Sqoof) for everyone who wants to watch it all go down. Fortnite Reddit Community, let‚Äôs get it done!

Once the event is over, feel free to post about it on the sub and send some clips/images to me over on my Twitter (@xsqoof) I‚Äôll be making a massive collection of all our community events. Feel free to also share some ideas for future events in the replies of this post or via my Twitter DMs. You can also share your thoughts in my Twitch chat when I go live as I‚Äôm really interactive with chat as well. Thank you all for reading, let‚Äôs get this going!

Stat padding is a thing from sports to video games. (Notable: WoT) most players who do this, (intentional or not) affect the gameplay in a set game. 

Why I even mention it?
For those who have played WoT, you know all too well how your search and destroy (1 life, one mission) goes when there's any stat padding in a game. It dilutes the content and overall gameplay. But why do I care so much in fortnite?

Well the game is meant to based on rng, and sheer build skill with shooting. And everything you loot is rng. But when a padded or anyone else goes out of their way to avoid conflict. They are effectively making the game less engaging as well as supply any decent player who comes by with free gear. Or in overall cases stat manipulation. Now why I mention this is most the expectation of ranked or more ""casual"" competitive gameplay. 

I know all the streamers say ""stats don't matter"" which at this point they really dont... but if you were a pro, you could say that.. afterall your stats would be high.

I know most won't see my point of fully disagree. But let's be honest, how many people out of everyone playing has wins? Only 1 of 100 get the win, and let's assume pros, are going to obviously win more, causing average or worse players to do anything to win. Even hiding all game. (Some say this is winning strategy) but let's picture in theory 100 players all being hiders.. thats going to be one boring game. I mean obviously this won't happen, but if any type of ranked/competitive comes to light for players, it will cause big problems in lower end gameplay. Effectively creating the ""bronze 5"" paradox. Meaning players who improve will never or very very slowly start to gain ranking.

Maybe I'm just blowing this out of proportion. But maybe there needs to be (with as many players) an alternative que that effectively limits the non participation in a game.",FortNiteBR

  Nobody likes dying instantly to a pump headshot with 100 health and 100 shield, and nobody likes shooting someone with a pump headshot and seeing 19 damage. I propose that the damage system be changed from being based on the amount of pellets hit to a simple hit-or-miss system and reducing the size of the spread. If you hit a body shot, it does a set amount of damage (damage fall off from distance should still apply). Same for headshots. This would greatly improve weapon consistency, however shotguns are currently too strong for that to be the only change. We would also have to decrease the amount of damage that the shotguns do. My goal for the damage numbers was to reduce the amount of situations that shotguns will kill in one shot, but still allow some capability of instantly killing opponents depending on what shotgun you have and how much health and shield they have. I wanted to make the type of shotgun, it‚Äôs rarity, and the headshot multiplier to be important and impactful to what your shotgun‚Äôs potential is. Please let me know what you think of my proposed damage numbers;

Blue Pump: 95 body shot - 152 headshot (1.6x)
Green Pump: 90 body - 144 head (1.6x)

Blue Auto: 70 body - 105 head (1.5x)

&amp;nbsp;

I am making this post because this subreddit seems to be under the impression that Epic are ""great devs"" or ""the best devs ever"". Honestly, I think this impression comes from a bias this community has developed towards Epic throughout the game's spectacular rise. 

Indeed, as well all know, Epic's been listening very carefully to /r/FortNiteBR. They have been implementing many fixes, skins, weapons, and overall, they have heeded to alot of this subreddit's demands. This had many effects. 

&amp;nbsp;

1. Epic is considered as a great developing company by this community.

2. This is the source of the entitlement that this subreddit has developped throughout the game's history. Don't get me wrong, many gamers are at least A BIT entitled (especially on Reddit), but this only reinforced it. Proof of this was the many complaints when they had to disable the refund feature.
 
3. The game is not going anywhere competitively. I am saying this because I don't believe this community has any credibility when talking about game balance and its competitive aspects. This is reflected by the many complaints and the different patches that were implemented by Epics following them, such as weapon delay, and overall lowering the skill ceiling.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Now that the illusion of Epic being great has been explained, it really is not that hard to understand why they aren't as good as people think.

&amp;nbsp;

1. They listen to this subreddit too much in the first place.

2. The last seamless and perfect content update was probably the start of Season 2. The gameplay what as smooth as butter, and, really, not many bugs were implemented at that moment. Sadly, it's not possible to say the same about the following patches.  For example, though it isn't a bug, the fact that The LTM Infinity Gauntlet was supposed to spawn only rare and above loot, which wasn't the case when it came out. They acknowledged the issue, but why does the issue exist past testing in the first place? 

3. To add up to the last point, Fortnite is developped using Unreal Engine, which is Epic's very own. The fact that they cannot produce a decent update performance wise, and/or fix issues that have been in the game for a long time, using an engine that they should be accustomed with, is an issue.

I highly doubt people are going to read this whole thing, and am fully expecting downvotes. I am not trying to bait anyone and am just trying to be realistic and to engage in discussion. I cannot be the only person whose interest in the game is dwindling. Some of my friends barely play anymore, and I think it is a result of what has been said above.

This game has great potential (shown by its huge success), but I cannot help but wonder how long it is going to last if it keeps going that way. I do apologize if I have offended someone.

Why do people downvote? People downvote when they don't agree with something, they downvote if they don't like the topic, or if it is not relevant. But I am tired of the trolls and the people who downvote without a reason, and later we get into an argument and they downvote my whole history, please, just be considerate. 

Have a good day!

TL;DR: Please do not downvote posts for little to no reason, it hurts the posts that should be on the front page, and the ones that should live in the dirt. Also if you do not have time to comment, just don't downvote becasue IMO, you need to say to the person why you are downvoting them (Unless of course it is something obvious).

I‚Äôm all for the grenade launcher and all other explosives in the game EXCEPT for the rocket launchers.  If this game want to be competitive one day the rocket launcher need to be removed.  Just like the guided missiles, the rocket launches lessen the skill gap and make for less fun end games. That‚Äôs just my opinion. Let me know what y‚Äôall think.  

And I know.. ‚Äújust build lol‚Äù but just building can‚Äôt stop an unlimited slue or rockets being launched at you. Especially in a final 2+v1 situation 

Also please don‚Äôt bash me for being bad or salty or whatever (i may be a little salty), but I just want opinions on the matter. Thanks! ",FortNiteBR

Here is my guide to winning this LTM. Follow this advice and a victory is essentially guaranteed when you acquire the gauntlet.,"I see everyone complaining about Thanos being too weak. This is simply not true. Yes, if you play him poorly then he gets gunned down quickly. I see the gauntlet change hands many times in matches and it always perplexes me because when I get the gauntlet I don‚Äôt turn it over. Here is how:

Step One: Get the gauntlet. 

There are two ways to do this. The best way is to be the first one to obtain the gauntlet when it hits the ground at the beginning of the match. It is not as difficult as it sounds. I accomplish this about 25% of the time. Sometimes my luck is better and I go on a run of several games in a row. You have to successfully guess where the gauntlet will fall and be floating in the general vicinity. Timing is everything. When the storm timer reaches 1:50 remaining, that is approximately when you want to come out of your freefall and into the forced umbrella/glider stage, give or take a few seconds. I generally try to keep Tilted Towers and Loot Lake to my left/west and keep Dusty Divot and Tomato Town to my right/east. For me this area between these points of interests seems to get the gauntlet much more than others. This is of course dependent upon the positioning of the circle, but in general if I stay around the center of the circle on the upper right quadrant then I will have a good shot at getting the gauntlet. Simply watch and listen for the gauntlet to fall as you come out of your free fall, and make a bee line for it. Try to anticipate where it will end its descent. Keep in mind that it can slide a lottle ways before coming to a halt. Once I get the gauntlet, the match is a guaranteed victory unless I kill myself in the storm accidentally. This has happened a couple times. But no player has yet taken me down while I have the gauntlet.

The second option for obtaining the gauntlet is to kill Thanos and take it. This method has a much lower success rate for me because of all the variables in play. If this is what works best for you, go for it. The important thing is that you get the gauntlet by any means necessary. The best way to take down Thanos is to be sneaky. Creep along the outer edge of gunfights involving Thanos and choose your moment to strike very carefully. You want to avoid being targeted by Thanos and other players until you make your move. When Thanos‚Äô health drops below 300 or so then you want to rush him. If you time it right and have a bit of luck, you can be the one to take the gauntlet. 

Personally, I end a match immediately if I do not obtain the gauntlet after a free fall. This is because, if you choose to float around and wait for the gauntlet to fall, you will miss your chance to loot and the game is typically a waste. So there is a risk involved to pursuing option one. Choose what works best for you, and good luck.


Step two: Moving around with Thanos.

Being in the open is suicide with Thanos. You will be targeted by multiple players and killed quickly. You want to isolate your opponents. You do this by finding cover. Bushy treetops are your friends. Houses are your friends. Player-built structures are your friends. Jump from place to place, but always jump from cover. The number one cause of death for Thanos is jumping while he is being engaged by the enemy. Get into houses and hide in the corner away from windows. Players will sneak up to you for a chance to take you down. Kill them one at a time, then get back to cover. As more players creep up, they will kill themselves off. Hide until the storm forces you to move. Then jump from cover to cover. Use trigger button to extend the range of your jump by doing Thanos‚Äô punch attack as you fall. Use hillsides and the approaching storm to your advantage as you seek safe spots to land and charge another jump. If a player engages you from a distance, hide behind cover before charging your jump.

Step three: Fighting with Thanos.

The primary reason to fight is to kill the players who are easy targets and to keep your shield replenished. 

When you leap from cover, come down hard on enemies with Thanos‚Äô punch attack. If you want to win, ignore the fire blast attack except in very rare circumstances. I don‚Äôt care if this attack has been successful for you in the past. It will get you killed occasionally because you have to stop to use it. My method is for 100% win rate. The fire attack puts that success in jeopardy. Only use it in endgame as the circle closes in and someone has a base above you. At this point jumping will get you killed because the storm is too close, so you can flame blast their base down. That is a rare situation. Usually you just want to chase people down and punch them. Only jump from behind cover. Punch punch punch. Smash smash smash. Seriously. Chase and punch. Only fight from cover. Make people come into your house or creep up to your tree, then run out and punch them. Nothing fancy. As soon as they die, run behind cover. If your building was destroyed, get to another one. 

General tips: Don‚Äôt be afraid to camp. You are marked on the map and people are going to come to you. This method will get you 15+ kill games almost every time. The key to victory is fighting on your terms and behind cover. Don‚Äôt be lured out into the open unless you know you can get the quick kill to restore your shield and then get back to cover without taking damage. 

Key tip**** Use rooftops/portaforts/trees/ and player bases to get the high ground. If Thanos has the high ground and is protected from gunfire, then he is essentially invincible. If players approach, you can walk off the edge without taking fall damage and kill them, then jump back up. If players engage from afar, you can easily jump to the next treetop or point of cover. 

Treetops are incredible. Use them. If the circle is in Wailing Woods, get the easy win. Use the lower branches to be protected by the higher branches.

Step 4: Endgame

When you reach the final circle there will generally be 2-4 opponents left. You don‚Äôt want to rush things here. Hide in whatever cover you can find a let the circle start to close in. Generally the other players will panic and begin to kill each other. You want to avoid taking gunfire as long as possible, but if you can kill a player while protected by cover, then go for it. As the circle closes in, hopefully there will just be a couple people to kill. Try not to use your jump ability. It is easy to choke a match here by jumping into the storm or being overtaken by the storm while you charge your jump. Chase and punch. Chase and punch.

The developers have really been keeping it fresh with new modes and crossovers (THANOS!) as well as frequent updates and it's amazing to see that these days.

Those things said, I would really like a mode where you do not have the building mechanic to cower behind like I have seen so many players do (hell even I do it lol). Yes I know that's part of the game and whatever, but I would just like to see a mode where that is out of the question. it's so cowardly to get ambushed and then start spamming walls around yourself to get behind cover. I like the graphics much better on Fortnite, and the performance is so much better than PUBG I would rather play fortnite.

I honestly would not like to see the building mechanics disappear altogether, but more like a penalty that is put on players that once hit, they would not be able to build for like 10 or 15 seconds, or something like that. 

If that were not an option, then to have a mode where you can play it more like PUBG would be awesome to have there. No building mechanics, just open world survival. 

Just wanted to see what the community thought about this situation. thanks for dropping in. ",FortNiteBR

What if each legendary skin had its own death animation to go with it as another incentive for the $20 price tag. I know some will say this may raise the price but we got back bling added with no rise in cost. Here are a couple examples that I thought of:

**Leviathan:** Fish tank breaks &amp; the water begins to drain out of the helmet causing the fish to flop around.

**Raven:** A purple cloud with ravens and feather surrounds the player then disappears.

**Omega:** The player presses a button and an orange beam of light teleports the player away, leaving the villain logo on the ground for a few seconds.

**Carbide:** The player presses a button and a blue beam of light teleports the player away, leaving the hero logo on the ground for a few seconds.

**Rex/Tricera Ops:**  A mini asteroid hits the player and when the smoke clears the player is gone.

**Dark Voyager/Dark Vangaurd:** Receives incoming transmission and zaps away.

**Battle Hound:** Howls and raises a sword before being teleported away.

**Love Ranger:** Receives a halo and flies away.

**Wukong:** Hops on a flying nimbus and shoots up into the sky.

**Raptor/Havoc:** Pulls out a white flag of surrender/ a Twitch Prime flag and waves it in defeat.

**John Wick:** Pulls out his dog before being teleported away.

There has been a lot of threads with founders getting mad because we don't get as many skins even though ""we have paid more"".

First off, you paid for one game and we got just that, one game. Don't expect perks in the other branch of it. We were not promised anything for BR when buying StW. 

Secondly, saying things like ""we funded BR"" is untrue. Epic has a lot of money from, for example unreal tournament and unreal engine. We paid for the development of the game we bought.

My third point is how much money Epic, as a developer, gets from prime as compared to StW. I don't have any actual numbers, but I'm sure we can all agree that the money they get from twitch prime is a lot more than they earn from people buying StW.

With all that said, I still think we will get something for being founders, just because Epic is epic. When and what is not said and that should not be why you're buying StW.",FortNiteBR

Obviously useful in PUBG because its hella buggy but a friend of mine has fortnite crashing on him sometimes so if it's possible it would be very useful to have that.

2) All voice chat during both spawn island and during the game, I really think that it's missing especially in the spawn island

According to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8hnxcs/weekly_milestone_for_level_80/?sort=new), you need a total of 546 050 XP to reach that level. 

Including weekly challenges (10x5k = 50k), daily challenges (70x0.5k = 35k), the starter challenge (5k), and the XP earnt from all of the battle pass tiers (5x1k = 5k), you need 451050 XP from battles alone to reach level 80. Therefore, you need to get an average of 6444 battle XP per day to reach this level. This figure will be higher if you don't complete all of the challenges.

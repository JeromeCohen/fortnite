These are my options that are not working
 1. Snipe him - well nope because the turret is covering the whole body
2. Build up to him - wel nope because he can destory a metal wall in few hits
3. Shoot out the turret platform - well nope because it has 5000 hp and you would need to shoot it 33 times with HEAVY sniper
4. Stink bomb/any other grenades - this can work SOMETIMES, only TEMPORARLY and I am not willing to lose one item slot for a situational grenade

Does anybody have any other ideas? Also, I dont think that reducing spawn rate balanced it (???) Dont want to be rude, but actually no counterplay.",FortNiteBR

I feel like the reduced mats has really affected the way people play the game. Fights end quicker as people look for the kill instead of over building. This in turn has lead to less third partying.

The shield/health granted after each kill is also amazing. It‚Äôs been beneficial in so many different situations. 

For example, a fight in the storm is about to end your 20hp and if you win the fight you get a free 50hp saving you from dying to the storm!

Would like to see how this mode feels in duos/squads and if it feels just as good then I hope epic really considers implementing it into the main game ‚ù§Ô∏è",FortNiteBR

‚Ä¢ It should have increased aim assist
‚Ä¢ Should have a scope attachment that makes it a sniper
‚Ä¢ It should be able to change your hitbox and make you invincible

Let me know what you think. Personally, I think this gun needs a little buff, as it's not game breaking enough yet.

I‚Äôve seen comments calling Ninja a scumbag of a human. Does reporting someone in a video game actually make a person a scumbag? Is that really what we‚Äôre going to base our morals on? 

Ninja raised $100,000 during a charity stream for suicide awareness in February. He followed that up with raising $320,000 for St. Jude‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital during a charity stream for Guardian Con. I‚Äôd be curious to know how many of the people who are spreading the hate have donated themselves. 

From what I understand, the person from who ninja accused of stream sniping him had different YouTube accounts with videos of him stream sniping Ninja. Most recently a user changed their name to match an account that was reported by Ninja, even though they were banned in an unrelated incident. Aka just for the karma. 

Yet people still think Ninja is immoral because ‚Äústill, he‚Äôs abusing reporting.‚Äù 

One wrong doesn‚Äôt make a right. Why aren‚Äôt the stream snipers and karma farmers receiving the same hate if people truly want to defend the integrity of the game? ",FortNiteBR

Actually, double shotgun would arguably add more variety, because rn everybody either uses single shotgun or shotgun-smg. Back at the end of season 4, people used both those *and* double pump.

But shotgun-SMG spam does? I could pump-smg with my keyboard upside down if I wanted to. With double pump you have to actually master the timing. Its a nice extra learning curve.

At this point in time, it is way too overpowered. I have some suggested changes to make it better.

1. Reduce the availability. 
I realize they changed it yesterday, but it still way too common. If I can have three turrets in my inventory at once, it is way too common.

2. Change the damage.
The turret should not be able to do 40 damage a hit from any distance. That is worse than the Heavy AR. And it shoots way faster. Change the damage to something like 10 or 15, then add more bloom to it. I‚Äôve seen people sniping with the turret. That‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs meant for. 

3. Make it easier to damage the player on the turret. This could be done by one of two things. Make it so that when the turret takes damage, so do you. That would make it more fair to the people fighting the turret. The second thing would to make the physical turret smaller. Right now, the turret is so large that it is nearly impossible to hit the player on the turret. Make the turret smaller so you can hit the player.",FortNiteBR

Why does Epic feel the need to consistently add new content instead of perfecting the aspects already in place? Epic takes the route of just adding things that break the meta and split the community for seemingly no reason. 

I understand wanting to keep the game fresh but that can easily be done with balance changes and things like map alterations or gun changes (like the Hand Cannon changes or SMG losing its silencer etc.) 

The glider update split the community in half, no one seems to like the turrets, and SMG meta was controversial too. It just seems like Epic is trying to add things too fast and no one can actually get used to the game anymore. Even the pros and streamers have voiced their opinions on the pace of epics updates.

I even made some videos on how unreliable turbo building was and that the tickrates of it should be improved. 
Turbo building makes lower ping players have an advantage when it comes to high skill plays. It takes away the art of replacing someone else's wall with yours because they can just hold left click(Unless your ping is superior by 40ish). Overall I feel it has taken a lot of the skill and precision out of the game when it comes to building.

These are just a couple of thoughts of mine on turbo building, what are yours? How would the game be if it were removed?

I know this is reddit, so there will be simple replies, but if anyone has a pretty strong depth stand point on the topic please reply. I'm interested in the read.",FortNiteBR

For clarity on this weeks topic we would like to try out Point of Interests (POI) and base feedback around them.

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Fatal Fields POI to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* Is it a viable drop for early game Material, should there be more material availability?
* How viable are rotations for kills and/or zone safety?
* Is the weapon drop rate enough, does it need to be nerfed or buffed?
* Is the POI layout good or bad in terms of cover, amount of buildings etc. would there be anything to improve on the layout or is it in a good state?
* Should Fatal fields be reverted back to its old state?

Being knocked can still tick down two health (not shield, obviously) so that being knocked doesn't last an eternity and encourages team mates to finish the fight quicker. But I do think ""thirsting"" aka kill whoring is too easy and prevalent with the current system. 

You can still easily kill a downed player but you have to go a bit more out of your way to do so which I think is needed. ",FortNiteBR

My main drop is junk junction, and it's a hike to the circle pretty much every game, so maybe, only have glider redeploy when you are in the storm.

Yeah you could make the argument of ""Well if you're a good player then you don't need to worry about the storm"" but to be fair, even good players have to deal with it as some point. ",FortNiteBR

What does it take for fortnite games to actually listen to the public?

The game is no longer fun to play and hasn't been for some time now. The developers are so keen to bring out new things (like the ridiculously broken turret) that they don't care to look at the feedback from the public.

We don't want new things!

We want fixes to the game.

Give me audio fixes so I can clearly tell if somebody is above or below me. Give me shotguns that are consistent (dont just say hit your shot because everyone has hit a point blank pump for 7). Give me build battles back - get rid of turrets and the quad launcher and the p90 - there are plenty of other spam weapons (GL, rockets, grenades, clingers and 500 different types of AR now in the game) and .

Let us all have and enjoy a meta without it being constantly messed with and changed. Let my bullets go where I aim them!

Why do more large names within the fortnite community not protest to epic more than they are doing? Our favourite twitch streamers and youtubers may complain every now and then but they are our voice since epic don't listen to just regular Joes like me. If I had the influence like Ninja or Dakotaz or Daequan or whoever else I would be messaging fortnite constantly. Tweeting out about it. Posting videos about it. Dakotaz did a little the other night on twitter and the response was amazing. Everybody agreeing the game is broken and suggesting ways to fix it. We need that more, constantly even.

Epic are destroying BR. I am done playing it until some major improvements are made and its sad because I used to love the game. It is a shell of its former glory.

Take me back to season 2 and 3. Please.",FortNiteBR

But adding re-deployment was a serious game changer. It was a change for the better in my mind but I mean everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  The game feels so slow without it. Why not have BASIC solo‚Äôs, duos, and squads and then have solo‚Äôs, duos, and squads WITH re-deployment? Then see what is being played more. (I get that is a lot of game modes and they would probably not do this) I understand the community feels 50/50 about this but I‚Äôd like to see how it pans out if they added back. I know not everyone feels this way but I actually think the game is so boring without it. I apologize in advance that you‚Äôve probably seen this argument everywhere but either I‚Äôm blind and haven‚Äôt seen a reddit update where they address their thoughts on this or they simply just don‚Äôt care haha.

For the past few months the game has been in a wild state, switching from good to bad. I‚Äôve been wondering why that is, and it struck me. The majority reason of why the game is going downhill in game quality is because of the competitive side of the community.

Fortnite was meant to be a fun game, not meant to be taken seriously. We have the most cartoony things in this game, and it‚Äôs what makes it great! It‚Äôs a way to relax and have fun with friends. But Post-Season 3-4 things started getting a little shaky. I‚Äôve seen a large increase in people taking the game way to serious, they want certain items and mechanics taken out just to make the game more serious and skill based, and that‚Äôs not what this game was meant to be. A game with just double pumping and snipers is not a good quality game. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this game will long live for another year, and Epic is doing a pretty damn good job for the state of the game is in. But if they keep listening to the competitive community too much I‚Äôm sure the game quality will be much worse by April 2019. 

TLDR; Competitive community takes game too seriously, a game that is meant to be a fun and relaxing game. Epic needs to figure out what they need to do next. ",FortNiteBR

I've reset my router, deleted and re-installed the game, reset my PS4 completely and have given up completely. The icing on the cake is that Shotguns are still shit.

3-I am really sick of dying to defaults. I'd rather die to a ZOEY than this monstrosity (no offence to zoey skins, but I just have that as 1 of my vendettas.)

so, can Epic just remove the option of fake defaulting? it would please me and probably a lot of people

I have kept quiet about this as it is a very unpopular opinion.

The heavy sniper is ridicules why should people who don't find full shield be killed instantly by one shot to the body. I am sorry but why should I be punished for not finding a second 50 pot or a slurp early and late game. I know a lot of players will defend the heavy sniper because they simply want that easy free kill but its just not balanced enough to be in the game. I don't want the sniper all out removed as I believe it is a cool concept but there are some things epic should do to make the gun less dominant in game. a thew examples are instead of the heavy doing 150/157 to the body do 130/137 at least that way you are not getting one banged by the weapon on 50 shield next would be to lower the spawn rate of them. I find the heavy sniper more than I find any other sniper considering it being arguably the best sniper in the game don't you think it should be a little more rare than it is currently. I honestly don't see the need to have a weapon so easy to use have such little negative affects to using it. thinking about it it's only negative is its reload speed and if you hit most of your shots you don't need more than one shot per person most of the time. Its by far better than any other sniper in the game. It has less drop, its more accurate and does stupid amounts more damage. something needs to be done to restore balance to that part of the game.",FortNiteBR

Why cant we hear footsteps clear enough? Why do shotguns not have higher base damage? Why cant we hear grenades when they are getting thrown from far away and then just explode in our face for 100 health. Just look at how pathetic this game is to what it was in season 3.

We wanted to come back around and give a final update for players that might have been affected by the PS4 Double Purchase issue that occurred around Season 6 Launch.

&amp;nbsp;
 
*For a timeline on the issue you can head over to our last update, as well as the initial Reddit post that brought the larger issue to our attention with the in-line Epic responses.* 

* [Initial Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9pb9h0/if_epic_has_ever_overcharged_you/)

* [Epic Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9rcwwy/update_on_ps4_double_purchases_during_season_6/)

&amp;nbsp;

Once again, we apologize for the extended delay on resolving this issue; we will make this right with each affected player. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
We‚Äôve been working with Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) to identify all players affected by this and SIE will be reaching out to the affected players.

&amp;nbsp;

Once we have confirmed SIE has reached out, Epic will be granting additional V-Bucks to those affected to make up for our delay in action around this issue. No action is required on your end.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you once again to /u/lilsus2004 for helping to surface the issue. We appreciate the community‚Äôs patience!

So maybe when it comes to comp games there are special rules or a format compared to what‚Äôs public. 

It really boggles my mind that besides the competitive scene no one realizes that it is basically a cartoon shooter. It‚Äôs SUPPOSED to be wacky with balloons, golf carts, rifts, turrets you name it.  It‚Äôs not Call of duty or battlefield which push themselves to be more and more realistic In a sense. But I‚Äôm then again I‚Äôm not THAT surprised because they come from competitive multiplayer games like halo where basically snipers and shotguns were for a long time the only viable weapons, gears of war where wall bouncing and shotguns reigned supreme for years. I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt sit there and truly believe that a game where the only option to fight is to double pump and every other gun might as well be vaulted. That doesn‚Äôt sound like a very bright future for a game to me. At least they are changing, adding new weapons, patching, vaulting. I come from a heavy background of destiny where for a long time our voices weren‚Äôt heard and we were stuck in a game where only snipers and shotguns were the weapons to be used otherwise you might as well not have played PVP. 

TL:DR People really take for granted what epic does for this community by whining and wanting things to go back to how they were before any changes were ever made to make this game stand out. ",FortNiteBR

You can probably build faster than me and your KD is better than mine.  I play the game to stay alive as long as possible, which isn't always glamorous or glitzy.  I'll out-wait you in buildings when you heard footsteps.  I'll camp under trees and hide in plain-sight.  I'll avoid far more fights than I'll engage in or 3rd party you after you squeaked out a tough 1v1.  Make no mistake, I want to win just as bad as you do, I just have to play to my strengths.

I've logged roughly 900 solo games so far and the game was an adjustment for me when I started.  Having experience in other first person shooters didn't translate well at the beginning and my aim was constantly off.  My son loved the game and it was a way for us to bond so to speak.  I found the ability to get right back into another game appealing, the graphics simple but eye catching and the playability was really well done.  It pulled me in and I started trying to improve my skills to make a better teammate when we played together.  

I remember how happy we were when he won his first solo game.  I know kids can be annoying for other players with the constant emoting and screwing around sometimes, but Fortnite has been a big part of his world, so vicariously it's big for me too.  His pre-game antics probably get on your nerves, they get on mine as well.  But we have something to talk about together, something to share and revel in.  

I finish in the top 10 a fair amount now and have four solo wins, one of which came last night with zero eliminations.  None of the other victories have more than two.  The highest kill count I've tabulated in a game I think is four.  Maybe I didn't super edit you into a trap below or out-snipe you from structure to structure.  Sure, I didn't build faster than you to claim the high ground and ran away to safety while you are the others were fighting it out.  

I don't care.  I won and it was thrilling for me.  I have shouted like a kid on Christmas morning getting something he thought he'd never get every time that banner paints across my screen.  

So here's a shout out to all the old men playing a young man's game.  To those who camp, who play the ground game, who aren't afraid to run or rift mid-fight.  If you fly far away for less traffic and more looting and mats.  Those hiding in trees, inside buildings or beneath other players' well built structures.

It's the perfect time for Epic to change and test new things.,"For real. I think people seem to forget that the game is in Early Access, or they're in denial saying ""It's been out for so long, it's not in Early Access anymore.""

Well it is. It says it every time you load into a match.

Everyone needs to understand that when they decided to play an EARLY ACCESS game, they agreed to put up with any and all changes/tests Epic decides to try out.

Taking bounce pads out. Adding chillers. Testing Glider Redeploy... They're all tests for what they want to put in their final product when it's finished.

MANY games in the past have gone through LENGTHY Early Access periods and honestly? People forget EVERY TIME that it's early access and treat the devs as if the game is finished. It's one of the downsides to releasing your game Early Access I suppose.

But it is what it is.",FortNiteBR

Well it is now the middle of November and we haven't gotten much word on that, but there is a serious issue involved in that, and that is what happens to duplicate items, especially store bought items.

I think they should offer a full refund of the VBUCKS ONLY on store bought items. No actual money would ever be given back, so Epic doesn't actually lose a dime. I could see a scenario that you get a lot of vbucks back, and then you are spending them like crazy, and you are then short some, and you are more inclined to buy more. 

In my opinion that is easy. Now the harder situation is battle pass items. I have many a same item from Seasons 5 and 6 on both Xbox, and PlayStation 4. What happens with these items? Full value, half value, only skins, gliders, and pickaxes? I think it is a serious question. 

Just as an example, and this includes Skins, Gliders, Pickaxes, Contrails, and Dances, and does not include Loading Screens, Toys, Backblings, Banner Icons, Music, Emotes, Sprays. If it was a full refund on all items, I would have close to 35,000 v-bucks. If it is a half refund on Battle Pass items and a full refund on store bought items, I would have about 21,000. It would be about 15,000 if it was just skins and store bought items, and if it was just store bought items you would get this refund on, I would get 8,900.

What are you guys' thoughts about what they should do about duplicate items? ",FortNiteBR

Just standardise the damage for shotguns to make them like every other single weapon in the game. For example, you don't shoot someone in the arm with an Assault rifle for 7 damage, it's consistently one damage, with a headshot multiplier and damage fall off. 

So, I propose reducing the headshot damage multiplier and adding an insane damage fall off. 

Shotguns are a close range weapon. I don't see why anyone would be made for hitting 2's or 1's for anything outside of 10 metres. That's what SMG's are for at that range. Say 10-30m. 

Just make the damage more consistent. This is what is frustrating people. Even if the damage is 100 but a consistent 100. With the amount of lag (I'm on console) from people using wireless set ups and very slow internet, being spot on accurate is difficult sometimes. People can genuinely teleport a step to the side between the moment you press the trigger. Its pretty frustrating.

Just a thought, hope it's implemented. Used to love fortnite. Think epic games has personally forgotten what made them so popular. It wasn't balloons, turrets, and quad launchers.

The design overall is uninspired and has no real flair or charm to it, and it just takes up unnecessary space. I don‚Äôt see them running around anymore but back in S4 they were fucking everywhere, and were the most annoying, bot-ish players ever (understandable so, considering the tier requirement) and I just overall dislike it.

I know some of you may like him, but why? Why when there are so many more creative skins would you EVER equip him? Like I‚Äôve heard from my previous post that someone wanted him but didn‚Äôt have the chance, and I just can‚Äôt fathom that.

Let me know what you think. Personally I‚Äôm just not too fond of overly simplistic army themed skins, and this somehow sparks my hatred for them even more. But rock what you want! I‚Äôm all for whatever someone wants to wear (just know I‚Äôll be hunting you down if I see you)",FortNiteBR

Building: One of the main reasons redeploy was so great is because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about someone from 200m away shooting me down (taking no skill) and killing me, just because I am building. People now, like they always have when they are losing a build battle, because they are not good enough, they drop down to the bottom and break down the builds, they get the kill because they were the worse player. It also conserves material, because I don‚Äôt have to ramp rush using double ramp floor wall, just so I don‚Äôt get shot down.

2. Intensity: when re-deploy was in the game, going for high kill games was a lot easier because instead of having to run, you can just glide to your next destination. Even if you aren‚Äôt a hardcore player, it still increases the speed of gameplay, which is almost always good and makes the game more interesting. Ever since they removed it playing the game hasn‚Äôt been nearly as fun, and it feels very slow.

3. Flexibility: If someone is engaging me from a long distance, and redeploy is not in the game, I am forced at a long distance engagement. However if it is in the game, I have the option to either fight from long distance, or take the risk and glide to the player, potentially putting myself at risk, and fighting in close quarters. If the player is good enough, he will be able to track me down through the air and possibly get some damage on me or even kill me. I am taking the risk to fight up close because I know that I generally can win a close 1v1. This allows me to take the risk of potentially taking damage in the air, but also allows me to fight up close. 

4. Skill gap: I already alluded to this, but redeploy allows people to use the skill gap. This essentially summarized everything I have said but, I can use the building skill gap to my advantage, since I do not have to worry about being shot down. I can fight up close, which probably is the most skill demanding way of fighting. And I can push people who might be worse than me, since I do not have to have an awkward quick peeking fight with AR‚Äôs and snipers.

In conclusion I never had so much fun as when there was re-deploy. I‚Äôd even venture to say that it was more fun than season 3 which was my personal favorite season. Please Epic, re-deploy was one of the best features added and it made it so much fun.

P.S: half of my friends have quit because of redeploy going away, and they said they will not play until it is added back.

End rant

Also if anyone would like to present any points as to why it shouldn‚Äôt be in the game I would be glad to discuss.",FortNiteBR

So for any call of duty mw2 fans out there, here we go. 

I want to suggest making this fortnite themed, because you will be getting 4 new abilities that go into your slot. So I will roll with some non-thought out examples that I hope the community and epic can refine. 

Concept: an item that will be used in 1 of your 5 slots

Uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary drops (could throw a 5th option in aswell)

Feathered boots (of the chicken defender)  - does not take fall damage

Engineering plans (stolen from the tower recon specialist) - materials cost 25% less 

Stopping powder (crafted by Castor himself) - 
10% extra damage per bullet, 2% with shotguns

Wick‚Äôs Clip (John‚Äôs personal ammo magazines) -
Reduces reload time by .25, .50 for snipers

You can find these items out of a chest, llama, or crate. 
Here‚Äôs the thing about rarity, I‚Äôm sure we could theory craft the tier list of these items and how they would rank. I would suggest to release them for a week and once the meta sorts them out, rarity can be applied to each item. 

I know this is basically perks, but so is any other instrument used to apply extra math into the game, it‚Äôs really how the math is presented which pleases the player in most cases. Hopefully epic can have some fun and integrate some system similar to this into the game at a point. 

If anyone has suggestions or improvements (I tried to keep it as open for discussion and suggestions as possible) feel free to post!! Enjoy theory crafting my friends.

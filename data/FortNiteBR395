FYI: So, i'm on console. My biggest issue is the massive difference between ADS and regular sensitivity. Trying to hit someone far away by ADS with an AR feels impossible because its TOO sensitive. But then up close with a shotgun or AR ADS it feels too slow to keep up with people jumping around. Any advice?",FortNiteBR

I really think epic games need to address doubling/trippiling/quadding more because the way I see it if the gun is one shot gun which has high dps you shouldnt be able to switch to the same gun to avoid the fire rate

Daequan is just now doubling/trippling with desert eagle/hand cannons/tactical shotguns guns just because hes honestly butt hurt that double pumping at least with pumps got fixed . Now im not saying hes not good hes definitely one of the best but now hes just abusing with different guns just because hes butt hurt that it got fixed.

Now this mechanic abuse is available on all guns now tactical machine,AR I dont think matter too much since no ones going to waste that many bullets and waste a slot to switch (in my opinion)

These are the guns which I think needs to be addressed personally. 

Revolvers 
Tacticals shot guns
Hand cannons.
Snipers

Its just annoying that people are just trying to find a way to abuse the mechanic just because they are upset that a mechanic which was clearly an exploit is removed(double pumping shotgunning)

Is this a feature so conscientious streamers can save the people they kill in game the potential 'embarrassment'?

Is it to deter stream sniping in some way? If so, how? Is the idea that if the sniper appears as Player1234 it would negate them some recognition when they kill the streamer thus making them not bother? I mean they could still do other things to flaunt, like building structures as I've seen in summit's stream, or just do it for the inherent pleasure they must derive from making the streamer mad.

Does it force the anonymization of the streamer's name on other people's clients?

36,Chrisamelio,1519410659,7zq9eo,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zq9eo/did_the_math_for_you/,9,Did the math for you,"Hello fellow FNBR players, yesterday I decided to buy the Battle Pass for the sole reason of getting The Reaper and his pencil picaxe cause I’m a big fan of the John Wick movies. Since he’s the last tier reward [and I didn’t get the last Battle Pass] I decided to do the math to know how long it would take me and how much I can miss in order to get every tier and thought I’d might share it with you all. If you wanna skip all the math and go to results go to the TL;DR.

So let’s start out by counting out all the possible stars throughout 67 days of the Battle Pass as of yesterday: 
[This is considering you maxed out everything, meaning you got to level 100]

•Daily Challenge (5 per day) = 335
•Weekly Challenges (40-50 each)= 440
•Free Pass Challenges = 50
•Level 10 Stars (10 every 10 levels) = 100
•Level 5 Stars (5 every 5)= 50
•Level 1-4, 6-9 Stars (2 stars each) = 160

Total Stars = 1135
Divided by 10 for each tier = 113.5 tiers

Alright, now we know how many possible tiers we can have if we do literally everything, now let’s figure out what we can miss with those extra stars.

•Extra tiers: 13.5 = 135 stars

So here’s some possible situations:

•You can’t get to level 100:

135 divided by 3.1 (amount of tiers for every 10 levels) = 43 levels 

Meaning that if you complete daily and weekly challenges as long as you get to around level 57, you’ll be good.

•You level up to 100 but don’t always play every 3 days for whatever reason so you’re gonna miss some daily stacked up challenges:

135/5 (stars for each challenge) = 27
You can miss up to 27 daily challenges or maybe mixed with a couple 5 star weekly challenges that you couldn’t complete as long as you get to level 100.

Now let’s get real and assume this is not a perfect world in which we can’t complete all the challenges nor get to level 100. 
•So let’s meet in a middle ground and say playing decently you get to level 70 and you missed some daily challenges.

30 (missed levels) x 31 = 93 stars

135-93 = 42 left stars to miss

42/5(daily challenge stars) = Rounded to 8 missed daily challenges.

This is probably the most possible outcome for most people, so if you play some matches every day, level up around 8 levels in average a week and miss around 8 daily challenges, you’ll be done with it right on time. 
I know leveling up gets harder and takes longer the higher you get so ideally throughout 9 weeks you should:

Week 1: Get to level 24
Week 2: Level 38
Week 3: Level 48
Week 4: Level 56
Week 5: Level 62
Week 6: Level 66
Week 7: Level 68
Week 8: Level 69
Week 9: Level 70

This is just an estimate without considering the XP Boost or your level of skill in the game but it’s an ideal exponential path. 
So as you can see if you dedicate yourself a little bit it’s not that hard to get there, so now go get that Reaper!

Notes: 
I’m not considering special event challenges which could help you out to get back on track if you missed something.

Also this is for people who are starting from tier 1 and did not have a head start.

This is mostly considering you’ll finish all the weekly challenges and free tier one which is easy.

Sorry about the editing, I’m on mobile. If I missed anything or want to know something else please feel free to tell me so I can edit the post.

TL:DR: 
You get to level 100, you can miss 27 challenges.
You do every daily challenge, you can get to level 57 without missing anything.
If you’re an average player, you can get to level 70 and miss 8 daily challenges
In average you need to level up 8 levels per week but keep in mind it gets harder the higher you level up.

Even the new weekly challenges feel more like chores rather than actual challenges aligned with in-game goals such victory royales or a certain amount of kills in a single game (something which actually adds a challenge to the game). Now I'm not suggesting skill based matchmaking, but I have heard some pretty cool ideas on this subreddit. One of which is a ticket system, where winning a battle royale or a certain # of battle royales nets the winning players a ticket for that game mode which allows them to enter a single match, like a w""inners battle royale"", which could award things like a small amount vbucks, or another currency which could be used on cosmetics (the higher you place the better the rewards). I think it could be cool if the rewards were specific to that game type as well (solo, duo, and squad would all have separate cosmetics) I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

They are one of the worst things to happen to the gaming industry, especially when done by companies like EA. 

But what Epic is doing with Fortnite (and Psyonix with Rocket League) is in my opinion, using micros perfectly - THEY DO NOT EFFECT THE GAME AT ALL! There's no pay to win, just pay at your leisure to have a ton of badass cosmetic options. If you don't want them, great. If you do, they are there for you. This is one of the biggest reasons I happily got the seasons 3 pass. 

They have created a game that is at it core, incredibly fun and addicting. The game they presented was so much fun that you actually wanted to find a way to support the work that they are doing. The micros given to us aren't shoved down our throats, aren't insanely overpriced, and they make you want to spend the money with how cool the cosmetic options are.

Let's not forget to mention the major point of base price. Big ol $0 for fortnite if you only care for PvP (can pay to support full game) and RL is $30. I'm Canadian so I currently pay $91.39 for a full priced game that more then likely has micros.

Just wanted to express all that. In a world where gaming companies are sponging every last dime from their consumer base, I think it's only right to acknowledge those who are making the gaming industry better for all Thanks Epic!!!",FortNiteBR

We just pushed a Server-side update (meaning you won’t see this but there’s magic happening in the background) to address issues with lag that was occurring for the first 5-7 minutes of a match. With the launch of V.3.0.0, we had a regression in Server performance, which was the culprit of that pesky lag you were experiencing.

This should now be resolved, so please keep us in the loop if you continue to experience lag on any level.

*One thing to note*: The fix for the “chests/doors not opening at the beginning of the match” bug is what caused this performance regression, so we are rolling this back. We are diving into other solutions for this bug that won’t degrade overall performance. We also have a larger overhaul of our core networking systems in the works that we’ll share more details about in the near future.

Cheers,

Chris_Attalus

AINT NOTHIN CHANGED WE GOT JUST AS MUCH DPS NOW AS WE DID BEFORE SHUT YO CRY BABY ASS UP

anyways, Double pump was  a little strong in all honesty, simply because the damage shotguns do is instantaneous burst, meaning that you only have to see someone for a split second to do massive damage. When you combine that with being able to do that back to back, it can be annoying.

Often, I recieved hatemail for doublepumping such as ""you won't last in the new update"", ""use just 1 pump if you have skill, double pump is for people who can't aim"" and ""why don't you use a tac shotty like a real man"". I often replied along the lines of ""I'm playing to win and I never hated on the way you did the same. Get your ego out of my chat"" (https://www.twitch.tv/sirbaconater btw)

The main thing I ran into is that the better players actually were the only ones running double pump for some odd reason, the only times I died to it was when I was in a building fight and accidentally gave up the high ground or when I potato'd mid fight and forgot to build. Yes, BUILDING WAS A DP COUNTER. 

Now that DP is out of the game, i've run more loadouts, all consisting of multiple close range weapons to maximize the dps available to me. My favorite so far is double Tac shotgun and pump+ tac smg. Sadly y'all will all complain about it in 2 weeks and 4 weeks from now I won't be seeing a single person carrying a purple smg because ""it's op omg ur garbage for using that"" when the gun is in the game for you to use it.

Anyways, the double pump nerf only nerfed the slim number of bad players abusing DP because yes, they couldn't aim. However, the good players got no change while the bad players who wouldn't use double pump got a buff. I'm tired of egos who say that someone is bad for running a certain gun or loadout just because someone else doesn't like it. That's how you create toxicity in a community. The fortnite community has been fantastic up until the double pump triggering so many people. If you want to be good so badly, why not use the best guns? The best players are going to use the best guns.

you'd be putting yourself at a disadvantage by limiting yourself to the loadouts you run. I've probably said this 12 times in this post, I'm just tired of seeing people complain about it because they won't run it.

Whether you like or dislike my opinions, keep in mind they're opinions that are mine, and i'm not forcing the opinion on you, merely suggesting you change your playstyle. That being said, Follow me on twitch, I stream daily at 8pm central time. &lt;3



Edit: I realize now that having an opinion and putting it on reddit wasn't a good idea. I won't have unpopular opinions from now on because I just get threats and hate mail. /s",FortNiteBR

1. You can only pickaxe a knocked player to confirm your kill gives your team time to get over to you and help. But more times you go down the faster you bleed out to balance it out.

2. You can't shoot or Kill a DBNO player at all and have it so the squad who came out on top is rewarded with reviving his teammates. 

3. Have a 5/7 second cool down on DBNO players so you can't kill them until 5/7 seconds have past. 

This is just my opinion and what I think could work anyone on the sub I know you guys are clued up and have amazing ideas 💡 so any improvements or if you would like to see this try get a dev to look at this please leave feedback comments cheers guys...

1 farm resources and learn to build! If you are running from point A-B, farm some resources along the way, and force yourself to learn how to build. This is what separates the above average players to just average players.

2 don’t be afraid to be aggressive, but play smart aggressive. After I went Rambo mode a few games, I noticed I won a lot of my gun fights. A lot of it came down to good positioning, but none the less, me forcing fights and playing wisely worked well and helps you grow as a player. Playing scared is not a good approach.

3 Position weapons in your inventory so you can quickly switch to them. I always go, AR, shotgun, and then sniper for my first 3, so in a fight, switching quickly is super beneficial!

Make it so it explodes on impact. Change it into a rare item, and make it explode on impact. This means you could actually use it to escape. Shorten the duration it lasts for to around 4 seconds.

This would make the grenade much more viable in fights and worth carrying around instead of a normal grenade or depending on preference an inmpulse grenade.",FortNiteBR

I have 50 hours on fortnite, over 600 games, 0 solo wins, and I’m still a terrible player with a .5 KD ratio.  
I watch tutorials. I land in popular areas, mainly Tilted, to practice fighting and building. I rewatch and analyze my games. 
Possible reasons:
A) this is the first game I have on the ps4 and I might just not be used to this high sensitivity. Still, I thought 50 damn hours would be enough 
B) I don’t have headphones. I rely on my TV’s sounds, which confuses me a lot sometimes, and I can’t tell directions. However, this doesn’t have to do with 1v1s which I am still pretty bad at.

Not sure if this is a bug from the new update, but the client says that my account has either been banned due to:

* Fraud 
* Me asking for my own account to be disabled
* Being banned

From my knowledge, I haven't made any in-game purchases or done anything to make myself a fraud, and I know I haven't asked for my own account to be disabled (which still gives the possibility that someone else impersonated me and asked for my account to be disabled), which means that I've most likely been banned. 
The thing which annoys me the most though, is that, if it is indeed a ban, I haven't been told AT ALL about how long the ban will last for, or for what reason I am banned. I tried emailing the support team via http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/ and I sent them emails TWICE already, but have still not received any responses after 2 whole days.

Date of ban/disabled account: 22/02/2018

My explanation: So basically yesterady I kept on getting kicked from games 2-3 minutes into a game. It was saying something about using a vpn, cheats or proxy ect. That would only be a kick and I was able to keep joining but not stay in the game long enough. That was fixed and today at 3:30 pm I was able to get on and play the season 3 update, it was so cool. As a season 2 owner of the battlepass I got 5 tiers ahead so I bought this battle pass, that cost me £20 2500 + 300 vBucks. Then later at around 7pm so 3-4 hours later I went to play with my brother and I come back to my account, I was signed out of the game I tried logging in but told me that the servers were down. I then restarted the game and tried logging in but it told me my account was ""Disabled"" and gave me a set of 3 bullet points of what the cause might have been. I can promise that I have never cheated on fortnite nor have I planned to. I have used my money on fortnite to buy many skins and pickaxes ect. Alot of my pocket money which I don't get alot of had been spent on fortnite, then to find out all my money had just been wasted, really hurt. The only thing I can think of that got me banned was my mods for GTA which I use for FiveM RolePlay a server where you can RolePlay and use trainers to spawn in cars or teleport ect. Please help me get unbanned as this was false, please help me.

**TLDR: Rule changes discussion and clarification. [Please take the optional survey here](https://goo.gl/forms/B3dkXz72oU7YTxEs1)**

&amp;nbsp; 

Hello everyone,

Season 3 is here! This subreddit has grown exponentially. Here are some stats:

* Approximately 1500 new subs a day

* Approximately 2 million page views per day

* Approximately 15% of those views are unique 

[Awesome Stats Picture](https://imgur.com/5cXkdj0)

[We also are one of the fastest growing subreddits overall.](https://imgur.com/Sohi1Sm)

We've been a featured subreddit of the day twice due to our immense growth spikes, most recently on January 26th.

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, we get thousands of new posts a day, of which hundreds don't even make it through AutoModerator due to rule violations. 

Like any growing sub, with increased traffic comes the need for rule changes, and we'd like to open up the doors for some of the rule changes we have been discussing internally. Below you will see some of said items. We would like the subreddit’s opinion on these items to help us determine what the best rule updates for the subreddit should be. We want this subreddit to be a place where everyone is welcome and has content for everyone to enjoy, so we need ***your*** help and feedback!
_______

Before getting down to business, here are some quick mod notes: 

* If you post a new game idea with an image, be mindful that this subreddit is open to all. Reddit nor us mods are responsible if your content is used elsewhere. You post at your own risk. However, adding a watermark can be a good idea. 

* We've gotten a bunch of modmail on applications to become a Moderator. When we need new mods, we will formally announce when applications are open again. 

* We will be adding to the rules that selling of merchandise will not be allowed on the subreddit. We are not a marketplace nor intend to be one.

* Stop reporting a post just because someone disagrees with you. However, do report posts if someone is insulting you. 

* It is not targeted harassment if someone responds to you and is passive aggressive or does not like your post. Only report if someone begins insulting you. 

* Added to the rules recently was support requests. Requests for assistance for account issues, payment issues, game issues, and ban issues will be removed. Please use Epic’s support channels.

* In the near future, we will be automating our daily threads that we announced [here](https://ps.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7tnihp/rfortnitebr_subreddit_updates/), and will also be working on putting each one on the sidebar so you guys can find the threads any day of the week.

* Shout out to our friends over at Epic Games. Thank you for working with us on the recent Reddit Stream and giveaways! Thanks for always being around the subreddit and interacting with the community! 

* Similar to the Fortnitemares Event, Extra Life, and the Reddit Stream, we are looking to have more fun subreddit events and giveaways, so be on the lookout for details on that

_______

Back to the meat of this post, if there is a rule or something not listed below that you feel needs to be addressed, feel free to comment on that as well here.

Additionally, there are some current rules we feel the need to have to clarify. Those are listed below as well. 

_____

##**Rules Clarification**

These aren’t currently on the table for updating, we just want you to understand the why behind them.

**1) Posts that reference other games** 

Around this subreddit, the biggest offender is PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG). 

Here is the rule as it states now

This has no intention of changing at this time. Posts that directly bash other games or have any indication of ""game xyz does this better or worse"" are not allowed. This includes media articles. 

A well thought out post comparing or contrasting similarities or differences that does not have negative connotations in any game are allowed.

**2) Popular content creators' content and response to it**

There are several big Battle Royale youtubers and Twitch personalities that provide viewing content. 

Currently, this content is allowed in clip format so long as it is around 30 seconds or under (and this goes for all of your funny highlights and happenings in game). The biggest reason for including this item on the list, is just a friendly reminder to not bash on people and insult streamers or other individuals in this sub. This is something we absolutely do not tolerate.

Bottom line: if it is a clip or person you are not fond of, just ignore it and move on. Don't go into threads to start fights or post underhanded sly remarks about content creators or other people. You accomplish absolutely nothing by doing it and you are honestly wasting your own time. 

**3) Promotion and Self Promotion**

If I had to guess, approximately 90% of our removed posts are violations of the promotion guidelines. 
Here they are:

&gt; For every one promotional post you submit, 10 high-quality comments or posts should be non-promotional.

&gt; All promotion posts must abide by our low-quality rules (No clickbait, no all caps titles, etc.)

&gt; What counts as promotion?

&gt; * Links to videos

&gt; * Links to community websites

&gt; * Links to community content channels- streams, youtube channels, etc.

&gt; * Links to written articles

&gt; * Links to artwork and fan literature

&gt; * Feedback on content in the form of discussions, polls, etc.

&gt; * References to the above list

&gt; * Promotional comments in general

&gt; You also may also only make one promotional post every 3 days and any giveaway must be approved by the moderation team ahead of time.

This includes third party promotion. I would like to apologize because that is not made clear in the rules. Additionally, if you see a longer video or stream link, you can assume the poster hit the promotion guidelines. You can still report it and we can always double check. If you notice a pattern or suspicious activity, feel free to message the mods.

You are welcome to message the mods to see where you stand in regards to self promotion. 

**4) Match Result and Stat Screenshots**

Here is the rule as it stands now:

&gt; ##**Match Result &amp; Stat Screenshots**

&gt; We feel that the community can do better than just posting screenshots of match results &amp; stats. If something cool happened, tell us about it in a text post! Match screenshots don't do a very good job of telling a story and are often used to shame teammates or opponents.

This is an item not being considered for change right now, but may be in the future.
______

##**Potential Rule Changes**


Below we will discuss a few rules that are on the table for some additional clarification. We will include our current rules along with reasonings for why they are the way they currently are. 

**1) Meme Rules**

The bane of every subreddit. No matter what, memes will always be a debated topic. Debates can be had on various different levels. What types of memes are allowed? What determines a quality or low quality meme? Is it moderator discretion? Just because one person likes or doesn't like a meme, doesn't mean every other person is on the same page. No matter what is decided, people will be unhappy. And when you have 230k subscribers, there is a solid 0% chance that everyone will be on board with meme rules.

Here are the current meme rules

&gt; ##**2. Original**

&gt; * No templates

&gt; * No reposts

&gt; * No overly used memes

The rule we have gotten the most feedback on so far is the ""no templates rule"".

* ***Why is this a rule?***

This is a rule for a few reasons. One being that your generic template memes, Drake being the most common one on this sub, don't necessarily fit many peoples' standard for a ""quality"" meme. It may appear unoriginal and uncreative in some eyes. Half the time even now, we see template memes with high karma counts and while we do even remove these posts often, I can admit it is not very consistent on our end. While we try, there are template memes that slip through.

*(Note: memes/gifs that do not have anything related to Fortnite in them are addressed later)*

Without the low quality rule, memes would make up over 50% of the posts on the sub. One idea we have is creating set filters to allow people to choose what they want to see.

* ***Why are some memes that clearly break the rules on the front page?***

This is tricky. As a mod team, we do our best to catch the memes (and other posts) that break the rules, early in their lifespan. While we do remove posts that have reached the front page of the subreddit there are times that a post makes it to the front and is not taken down. We acknowledge that this has been inconsistent. 

The struggle for us is that there are many people who do not want to see those posts, but there is obviously enough people to upvote them to the top, which is why this is on the table for discussion.

**2) Post Filters**

With our recent subreddit updates to design, the flair filter posts function has kind have gone rogue and either disappeared or not working or some sort of in between. This will be fully fixed soon. 

Personally, I am comfortable saying that a very large majority of users here would like to be able to just flair filter posts they want to see, so they don't have to worry about posts they have no care for. This begs the following questions: 

* Should we force users to set a post flair on submissions?

* Do we just auto remove anything without one.

* Should we set a grace period for flairing?

* Do we only require specific types of posts to be flaired?

As a mod team, it is very hard to keep track and keep up to date with all the new submissions and making sure they are flaired appropriately.

As it stands now, flairing is optional, but what are your thoughts on it all?

Besides memes, we believe the topic that would benefit the most from flairs and needs to be addressed is

**3) Suggestion Posts**

All the map ideas, skins, dancing, harvesting tools, parachutes, and anything else you can think of...

Some are good, some are bad, and some in between. Is there a place for them here? Should they even be allowed? Our very own /u/blorfie [even had their idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7g4zbt/new_location_proposal_haunted_hills/), [implemented into the game!](https://imgur.com/3p37fxQ)  Is this something that should be required to have a post flair?

As it stands now, there is no rule in place at this time on suggestion posts, other than our rule regarding “Title Only” posts.

**4) Low Quality Posts/Posts Related to Fortnite: Battle Royale**

* ***What determines low quality? How much moderator discretion is involved?***

This is a very grey area and probably the item that does involve the most Moderator discretion. Here are the current rules for these items 

&gt; ##**1. High quality**

&gt; * Not pixelated

&gt; * No Microsoft Paint level cutting and pasting

&gt; * Videos/images taken with a phone are subject to removal

&gt; * Screenshots of social media posts (twitter/instagram/snapchat) will be removed

&gt; ##**3. Fortnite-specific**

&gt; * No allusions to other games

&gt; ##**4. Titles should not be clickbait**

&gt; * Titles should not entice users to click on it with false claims

&gt; * Titles should not be posted using all caps

&gt; ##**5. Title only posts aren’t allowed**

&gt; * If your post's image or video is not related to Fortnite without the title, it will be removed.

* ***Why is there moderator discretion? That seems unfair.***

This is unavoidable. Some posts could go either way when it comes to following or breaking the rules. Ultimately a decision has to be made as it is a grey area. 

Should these rules be changed and modified?

**5) Popular Streamer Clips**

These clips are currently allowed. We do our best to remove duplicates and rely on reports as well to find them. 

I've personally reviewed many other large gaming subs for comparison to see how they handle these types of clips. Like us, they all currently allow these short clips from big names. But is this right for us? Should we add a rule? 

##**Summary**

We want an open discussion on the direction the subreddit should be going. Share your thoughts and feelings about any item I mentioned, or any item that you feel is important. A few of the mods will be around to address other questions in the comments. [Please also take this optional survey here.](https://goo.gl/forms/B3dkXz72oU7YTxEs1)

My best game was 2nd place and I fucked up really bad to lose.  
My FPS history:  
Diamond in overwatch by the time I was level 40 (stopped playing shortly after, bad game) and when I was younger (MW2-BO2 era) I played tons of gamebattles (some reg guns but mostly snipers)  
  
Now...I really can't get a hang of this game. The aim seems kinda weird, the height you get from jumping is disgusting and height advantage is fucking ADVANTAGE in this game and we don't even need to talk about building yet, I lose in 1v1's even without building half the time (if we're even health)    
I use the exact same settings as Myth (I know this doesn't make me insta good, just saying this so you don't think my settings are a meme) and average 170~ FPS and I'm on low ping. My monitor isn't 144hz because I play mostly League nowadays but that shouldn't be the difference between me getting 20k a game and me instadying.  
I guess I need aiming tips mostly? strategies, whatever... I just don't know where to start and feel like I'm at an extreme disadvantage. I'm intrigued by the game but I almost just wanna switch to pugb because it's more of an authentic shooter.

[PC]","850 wins in and I can say, that this update has completely changed the feeling of the game. There is far too many odd things occurring this patch that seem to be flipping the game upside down.

First off, when I got on today. The gameplay immediately felt sluggish compared to past gameplay. Older patches (think Wednesday the 21st) felt extremely fluid regardless of the state of bugs. Although this time around, the game feels much slower when it comes to interaction, building, picking items up, shooting, and seeing damages get relayed. 

The second thing I could see with this patch was the distinguished color changes and contrast changes. Not only do these make my eyes hurt, but they don't feel realistic as Epic was scoring for. Previously they changed it by accident and regarded in movement to revert to previous palettes although seems to have overdone it.

To go on about this there are some other issues that have seem to come up. Often I am unable to hear players jump or land near me, or sometimes even move near me due to other noises having a higher priority. IE. Farming and hitting the crit-circles seems to deafen me so highly that I am unable to even hear my own thoughts. The Desert Eagle is extremely loud and is able to be heard clearly from 150 meters away. 

Hitmarkers are gone it appears. No indication of hitting or shooting a player. Sometimes you don't even receive any damage notifications that you are taking damage.

Currently hitting shots with no hitmarkers and hit sounds (other than headshots) is EXTREMELY unsatisfying.

Bullet tracers are gone for anyone playing on a setting below ""Effects - (EPIC)"". This makes it extremely difficult for players to know where they are being shot from.

Pump seems to have had a very quiet nerf on damage?(probably not, although it feels very inconsistent) Point blank headshots have done somewhere between 42-120 damage. Green tac does 135+ to head at same distance easily. 

Latency on servers seems to be absolute garbage, assuming due to mass player count, although players are zipping and teleporting all over the place while you attempt to shoot them.

Sometimes sounds do not play when you are directly near an enemy shooting at you.


Personal gripes : 

Being able to build anywhere is not a bad idea on paper but technically in game doesn't work well. This punishes players who have stuck around since the beginning carefully learning how to position themselves in the event of getting shot.

Turobuilding also punishes players who learned how to build. This only lessens the skill gap between good and average players.

Desert Eagle is extremely underwhelming for the hype. A pistol with spread. Interesting.



================



I'm assuming I'll be downvoted for this post, but it appears that the game has lost it's excitement for me as I have felt myself fall to these issues many of times today, and has left me and others I have spoke to about these issues, unsatisfied.

This got me to thinking: if the console versions can actually run at 60 FPS, then split-screen can possibly be done at 30 FPS.

I have to ask, if 60 FPS is possible on console, can we maybe see 2 player (at least) split screen at 30 FPS?

Everybody feels the magic of Fortnite. It reminds us older gamers of the days of playing COD4/MW2, Halo, Goldeneye, etc. because it is completely unique in its genre and at bringing together friends around the living room.

In 5 games today I've run into the following:

* I'm getting shot through walls. A lot.
* Rockets are exploding randomly without hitting anything
* Some guy just blasted me in the face with a pump and it didn't register (good for me but I should've lost that fight 100%)
* I'm STILL falling through my own structures
* The desync is worse than ever
* There's an area of pleasant park that's so laggy I can barely move in it. I honestly have no idea why, it's in one of the houses.
* There are graphical glitches EVERYWHERE, especially in cities inside windows. It's giving me serious PTSD.
* The audio glitch is still. freaking. there. It's been in the game for like 6 months.

Also, this hand cannon is the most useless weapon in the game next to the crossbow and minigun that you shoved in for no reason. You want to know why the silenced pistol, magnum, normal pistols, semi-auto sniper, crossbow, minigun and white/green ak are completely irrelevant? It's because you're adding weapons repeatedly with no balance whatsoever. There are way, WAY too many useless weapons just lying around everywhere. Add a slot or get rid of some of these things. 

The crossbow and minigun just came out and I've seen one person use a minigun in the last week. You wanna know what I did to the guy with the minigun? I pulled out my sniper and shot him in the face, because the minigun is worthless. Particularly in solos.

Please, please fix some of these bugs. PLEASE stop adding useless weapons. Half my friends have stopped playing and I'm running out of people to play with.

In the default settings I dont have an issue within the inventory but with the new changes to the colors of the item on the ground it completely ruined my ability to tell the difference between blue and purple. Switching to Protanopia in game now makes loot on the ground between blue and purple impossible to tell the difference between, but now my inventory its almost impossible to tell too. I've messed with the strength and it really doesn't affect it.  Personally I would like to be able to set custom item colors. This would literally let anyone who has an issue with item colors pick colors that fit them to exactly the way they need them to be.

Description of Protanopia:

Protans are people with protanomaly, a type of red-green color blindness in which the red cones do not detect enough red and are too sensitive to greens, yellows, and oranges.

As a result, greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns may appear similar, especially in low light. It can also be difficult to tell the difference between blues and purples, or pinks and grays. Red and black might be hard to tell apart, especially when red text is against a black background.",FortNiteBR

But is it just me or are some of these new quests are a little tedious and too specified?

If it works how it seems to, as in everyone gets the same quests each week. How does having location specific quests help the player finish the battle pack in a reasonable amount of time?

Making the quests more difficult based on silly things like location based kills is counter intuitive to the way Battle Royale works. 

Getting 5 kills at fatal fields can be difficult just finding the people each round. Now we have to waste our time spawning in and going directly to fatal fields every round instead of enjoying the game and playing at our own style and leisure like the old quests.


Getting a chest at a specific location (pleasant park for example): there are only a certain number of spawns each round in each location so you artificially increased the amount of time required for everyone to get BP stars.

TL:DR - The new weekly system is great but the location based challenges make the BP system more tedious and convoluted. It was straightforward before; play the game and probably complete your battle pass.

Now you have to specifically change your play style or preferred drop points to do the same quests everyone has which makes it take longer for everyone to do them.

Edit: and all comments claiming that location somehow makes these challenges ""more interesting"" ok guys totally.

""It's way more interesting to be told to kill someone at a specific place than just kill someone. ""

Not for me personally. Just makes it more annoying adding an artificial barrier to me completing the challenge.

You guys must be way too easily impressed.",FortNiteBR
342,danilkom,1519321109,7zgorj,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zgorj/a_detailed_look_at_the_amount_of_battlestars_we/,21,A detailed look at the amount of BattleStars we will get this season.,"Hello!

I wanted to figure out how many BattleStars we can get throughout the whole season, so I told myself to type it down in a post so I could go back to it anytime. So here we go:

Some important things to know about how to get BattleStars: 

* 1000 BattleStars needed to reach Tier 100
* You get 5 BattleStars for a level up that ends in 5.
* You get 10 BattleStars for a level up that ends in 0.
* You get ~~1~~2 BattleStar for any other level up.
* A total of **~~230~~310 BattleStars will be awarded from getting to lv 1 to 100.**
* You get 5 BattleStars from doing a daily challenge.

Those are the basics that didn't change since season 2.

But now, there is a **""Free Pass Tier 2 Challenges"" reward at tier 2 for F2Ps that awards a total of 50 BattleStars.**

For BattlePass owners, there are 50 BattleStars worth of challenge every week, the 9th week only giving 40. 
This equals to 50x8+40 BattleStars, or **440 BattleStars for completing ALL the weekly challenges.**

Note that there is also a ""Reward Item"" for finishing 4 challenges out of the 7 available every week, so there is a chance that BattleStars might be included in one of the weeks as a reward, but let's assume there isn't.

Everyone will also receive 1 Daily Challenge that gives 5 BattleStars, so, that is equal to 67x5=**335 BattleStars for doing all your daily quests** for the remaining 67 days at the time of this post.

If we add up everything, that is **a total of ~~1055~~1135 BattleStars for doing everything I highlighted above.**

I think I did a mistake somewhere, because it's just ridiculous. I suspect some of the ""Reward Items"" for later weeks are BattleStars, so it's not too bad, but we only have such a small margin of spare battlestars to get to tier 100 I feel like they're just baiting us to buy the bigger BattlePass.

If I did a mistake, feel free to comment so I can edit it out.",FortNiteBR

My request.
Please Epic Games, stop releasing new content. Focus on server improvements, bug fixes and other related. I don't care about the colors of dropped weapons that you are changing every patch, I don't care about 1 my pixel going out of the skin. The ping thing is going around this sub-reddit for months and none of Epic devs haven't even replied or announced anything about it. I'm slowly losing my hope of playing with 30 ping ever again, the only reason i'm losing gunfights right now is because mostly I get killed from a guy who already is behind the wall.I love the game how it is and I just wish that it worked stable whenever I want to enjoy it.

Now (as a lot of you do) I’m enjoying Fortnite as non other game; so I’m starting to thing if I would buy the battlepass. The thing that I hate from the battlepass is that you can get all the tiers that you want by just paying. I can understand that they can take more beneficits if they let you choose the quantity; but it broke the sense of that you have to play for a recompense.


Edit: I did not know that you could buy every battlepass tier that you want too in season 2. Sorry guys

I'm really not trying to slate it, just want a reasonable discussion.

The black knight is a cooler skin than any this season, and the final skin is essentially just a guy in a suit? I get that it is kind of cool when you think of it in James bond way, but it just doesn't compare to the knight in my opinion.

The 'throw' emotes are just random pictures now. The things I would want the most are the dances, but they lose their appeal eventually. The trails are cool, but surely there will be better ones released in the shop?

I love the idea of back bling because it is a step in the right direction for more customisation. Though from what I saw the only BP back bling are astronaut backpacks, which is quite underwhelming for me. I don't find astronauts 'costumes' as spectacular as other things. (Although the black one looks kind of cool).


I've been considering buying one skin and one emote or something from the shop, so I'm thinking it might just be more worthwhile to put the BP v-bucks towards this.

446,Trench_Bucket,1519306152,7zevdh,43,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zevdh/its_time_to_weaken_wood/,0,It's time to weaken wood,"These days it's rare to see anyone use anything other than wood when building. Despite being by far the easiest resource to find and by far the quickest resource to gather, wood is in many respects also the best resource, and this seems illogical from a balance point of view.

While brick and metal are stronger once fully built by 50% and 100% respectively, their health starts lower and rises more slowly, leading to a situation where wooden walls are harder to destroy for the first six seconds after they've been placed. It starts 10 health stronger than brick and 20 health stronger than metal, rising to 38 stronger than brick and 48 stronger than metal after four seconds, and only falling behind after 6.5 seconds.

In the current meta, which is exacerbated by the 3.0 patch, building bases with a view to the long term has almost gone out of the window in favour of spam building, either in defence to all but ensure you can't be damaged, or in attack to quickly rush one's opponent. In both cases the short term strength of wood trumps the long term strength of brick and metal. If under fire it's far more effective to spam wooden walls not just because the resource is easier to obtain, but also because it's actually stronger than its counterparts. 

If you're under fire it's far smarter to spam wooden walls than brick or metal ones, and given how easy it is to obtain wood it means that most players are running around, at all times, with the ability to build walls constantly in such a way that they are impervious to damage. While they are limited for how long they can do this, it is far easier to obtain wood than the bullets needed to destroy it, and it is trivial to replace any wall at the exact moment it gets destroyed making it extremely unlikely you'll take damage. Explosives are also generally ineffective against this style of building, and even the minigun is liable to run out of bullets before the wall builder runs out of wood. The only option you really have is to rush your opponent into a close range engagement, and while that can work, it feels like there needs to be more than one option to handle this scenario.

Building is one of this game's greatest attributes, but it, along with gunplay and strategy, have gone out of the window in favour of quick building tactics. It isn't that they don't have a place in the game but they are increasingly overbearing and the game doesn't offer much in the way of a counter. We're very much in a ""If you can't beat them, join them"" situation.

**Suggestions**

1) Remove the quirk that sees wood be stronger than the other resources to begin with. There is no need for this when the resource is easily the most common. Wood should be strictly significantly weaker at every tick than metal.

2) Consider making the other resources stronger generally. While brick and metal are stronger than wood the degree to which they are so doesn't feel like it makes up for their initial weakness or their rarity. I would like to see the game with brick being twice as strong, and metal thrice as strong. This might encourage people to build actual bases again rather than chaotic mazes of wood.

Current stats (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7egog6/wood_vs_brick_vs_steel_fight/):

Wood - Starts at 100, 13 Per Tick, Max 200

Brick - Starts at 90, 9 Per Tick, Max 300

Metal - Starts at 80, 9 Per Tick, Max 400

*Change to*

Wood - Starts at 40, 16 Per Tick, Max 200

Brick - Starts at 80, 16 Per Tick, Max 400

Metal - Starts at 120, 16 Per Tick, Max 600

This is a simpler setup but I reckon it is also more balanced and more intuitive. Wood would still be effective for building for traversal and aggressive rushes, which feels like it's initial intent, but a poor tool for defence, far more likely to be destroyed while it is being built. While it could still be spammed in desperation, it would no longer be suitable for soaking up endless ammunition.

Overall this change would strengthen building bases and weaken quick building especially for defence, but it would still very definitely be part of the game. Yet, and this is the key point, it would be just one of various effective tactics, rather than far and away the strongest.",FortNiteBR

I didn't camp the whole game as the clip was just 20 seconds of the end ( I have the whole clip) and just didn't see any teams because in the beginning when I landed at lonely with my friend we killed some people but he always got the last shot in so they was his kills.

Some sort of timed explosive device or one with a separate detonator would be a great addition to the game. I often find myself building up to a high cliff or building and then wanting to destroy my obvious stairs so people do not know I am there/so no one can just follow my route up. Therefore, the addition of C4 would enable you to blow the staircase from the top of your new location.

Other interesting opportunities with the C4 involve setting traps on crates or supply drops, destroying other players end game bases or as an additional damage dealer to enemy players.

Thank you for your time. x",FortNiteBR

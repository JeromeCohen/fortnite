No game should ever rely on the gunplay being random, whether it is competitive or not.

These players were able to run around in the open field jumping up and down without taking any shots, simply because they were fortunate enough to be saved by the bloom of other players which made shots miss, they would then use single shot kill weapons like the pump shotgun to kill players, weapons which don't rely on bloom as much.

The new shooting model is a step in the right direction, bullets go where they're supposed to, it's the way the game should be played, gunfights are a lot more skill based, if you're standing in the open field and get gunned down by a full squad, it's your fault for bad map positioning, good players will still be able to counter stuff like this, but it'll be harder to do so.

I hope Epic Games considers opinions of all players, new shooting models gets a +1 from me. I hope that just because the 1% of top players complain about the mode because they refuse to adapt their play style doesn't become the only voice Epic listens to.",FortNiteBR

My solution : An option to randomise the skins. The skins for your outfits, pickaxe and glider should change randomly after a game. The option can be equipped at the locker. The default skins change randomly and you should be able to do that with the skins that you own.

I don’t know if this has been requested already but it would be a really cool idea in my opinion. Any thoughts?",FortNiteBR

I'm not going to say any names but I was already having a bad day with the passing of my dog and I got on to stream and play to take my mind off it. I had just asked this person yesterday if they wanted to DUO because they spectated me while eating and saw me pull off a 20 kill game and said I was really good (I was shown a clip I had no idea until after when a bunch of people started following my stream and I asked what was going on). So after they politely declined I went about my own business and today after killing several players in a game and down to the top 5 I ran into this streamer and after killing them and seeing their names I threw them some emotes and their first reaction was to call me a stream sniper and report me for it without any proof (I know this because I had some people come to my stream from theirs and ask me if I was stream sniping and told me that they had reported me for it). I have a live broadcast that can show otherwise and it's already hard enough to get your name out there and get viewers without a popular streamer bad mouthing you. It's a Battle Royal game and if 2 people are good and play on the same server they will casually run into each other so don't just assume things and make accusations without actual proof of it.

Here it is.



**Myth**

So there are a few issues with the new mode that I personally dont like.

- To start off with I just dont feel like the new model is actually relevant to be quite honest. It seems like its really only effective when you are either, A, at an insanely long distance away from your opponent or B, when someone isnt paying any attention to you at all. Overall the first shot accuracy isn't used enough to be enough to replace the primary shooting model.

- One of the most effective uses of the new aiming system is just straight up ghost peaking with every weapon over a long range. Doesn't really make for quality engagements imo :/

- Shotguns also feel really lack luster and could probably use a 25-50% headshot damage buff. As many of us know the SMG has kinda made its way to be able to contest the shotguns for the better close range weapon.


**Daequan**

THIS CHANGE IS TRASH
HERES WHY
G A R B A G E
on a serious note
My opinion on the shooting test is a negative. Promotes camping and less movement by nerfing aggression because the aim mechanic forces you to not be moving and makes quick peeking is superior. Shotgun headshot dmg is too low. Smg's &gt; Shotguns at all ranges if you can aim. If you think ""double pump meta"" is OP (which its not) just wait til you see Ghost Peek meta if this were to go through.


**CaMiLLs**

Honestly the new mode is not that great solely on them trying to nerf damage on the shorty. What they need to do is fix the inconsistency of low damage rather than trying to lower headshot damage I just don't think that helps in the long run. On a side note the smg and even the revolver being more of a factor in games now is also dope to see. The accuracy thing is cool but its not everything to me I like that bloom was fortnites thing it felt unique having that in the game something I don't have in other games but I wouldn't mind if they changed that. All in all just don't like what they did with the shotty very unnecessary


**Hamlinz**

My opinion on the test shoot #1 I see they were trying to make the SMGs relevant, but i think they went way to hard on the shotguns trying to do this. I also don't like how you can take advantage of ghost peaking with almost every weapon now and always hit even standing up (this will slow down gameplay, especially competitive) it's definitely fun hitting people on those first shots though, i just don't think this will be good for the future of Fortnite.


Hope this was something you guys enjoyed. Much love. We cant wait to test out the 2nd mode! As we all pretty much feel like this one is a bit lackluster. &lt;3",FortNiteBR
55,Yatess19,1517967837,7vskec,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7vskec/new_mode_idea_fort_fight/,95,New Mode Idea: Fort Fight,"Hello r/FortNiteBR ! I can't believe how fast this community has grown over the past couple months. Its really cool to see and we are so close to hitting 200k subscribers on the sub reddit. Anyways, I digress.


I have been thinking of a new LTM that could come to Battle Royale in the future. I hope you guys like it and maybe, just maybe someone from Epic could see this and pass it on to the team.

The Mode: Fort Fight (If you have a suggestion for a better name, let me know!) 

The Premise of the mode: Each team has 50 players (50v50) on it and they start about 100 meters across from each other. Each player gets 100 Wood, 100 Bricks, and 100 Metal to start off with. Each team has two minutes to build a base to try and become victorious. In this two minute period, a storm wall blocks and separates the two teams, so that they can't see and shoot the other team while they get ready to fight. Each player also starts off with either (Random: Grey Auto AR, Grey Burst AR, Grey Pistol, or Grey Revolver.) and over time, new and better weapons are randomly dished out to different players on both teams. This causes the game to get more exciting and packed with explosions and gunfire as it progresses. Also, the player will earn Ammo and materials as the game progresses as well

(Ammo: 5 AR bullets per second, 10 light bullets per second, 1 heavy bullet per second, and one rocket per second)

(Materials: 5 wood every second, 3 bricks every second, and 1 metal every second)

(Heals: 1 bandage every 20 seconds, 1 mini shield every 25 seconds.)

Also, you should be rewarded for playing well and getting kills. Each time you get a kill, one of your guns is randomly upgraded a tier or you get rewarded either a Grenade Launcher or RPG. For example, if you get a kill with your sniper, your sniper would be upgraded from Rare to Epic and so on, or you could get a Splode weapon. 

**Keep in mind that these are simply rough ideas and tell me in the comments what you think and how I could improve the post.**


The goal: Last Man Standing. (I know, sounds confusing since the entire start of the game is team based.) After one team is eliminated, the remaining players on the victorious team are given 40 seconds to build their own base and fight it out in classic Battle Royale style gameplay! The victorious player will be awarded with large amounts of XP for technically winning twice. 


Why I think this mode would be amazing: I'm pretty sure all of us had fun in the regular 50v50 mode that came to the game in December, but it seemed very repetitive in the way that you wouldn't see anyone until the end of the game and it usually ended in a 15 v 2. While it was fun for a little while, we all wanted something more. In the trailer, it made the mode look as if the mode was packed with super big Fort battles and teams rushing each other! This was usually not how it happened however.

Its damage is fine and its accuracy does not need to be touched. 
The thing that puzzled me is, why does it have an infinite ammo clip? 


That thing can have 999 ammo and be fired for what seems like an eternity! 
It could have a clip size of 200, so the person would have to reload. The reload 
time should be about 5 seconds, this would balance out the Minigun. 
When Epic Games said ""Bigger damage and a Bigger magazine size"", 
I seriously did not think this thing could be sprayed forever.

TL;DR; Minigun should have a clip size of at least 200, and have a 5 second reload speed, this will encourage 
more counter play

It was fun for the first few weeks it was discovered, but now its dull, repetitive, and predictable.

This exploit completely eliminates any kind of decision making between weapons. The game has pump and auto shotguns. Pump does massive damage with less fire-rate and auto does less damage for more fire rate. It is up to the player to decide what kind of play style best fits them. However, since the exploit exists, it is up to the player to master switching through weapons to match up with people that have already mastered it. I very much enjoy using all the weapons because they all provide unique ways of approaching combat.

A number of accounts have recently been compromised using well-known hacking techniques. Epic Security is providing this bulletin to explain what’s happening and how to best secure your Epic account and other accounts.

**Shared Passwords**

Though it’s common to use the same password across multiple Internet sites, this is a dangerous practice and should be avoided. If one of those sites is compromised, hackers can use your email and password from that site to break into your account on other sites using the same password.

*Here’s what happens:* Attackers frequently download password dumps - lists of username/password combinations -from third party sites and use [credential stuffing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing) to find out what other websites those credentials work on. When they are successful at logging in to those accounts, they see what trouble they can create for the account holder. In many cases, that appears as fraudulent V-Buck purchases.

**Fake Fortnite Offers**

We’ve seen several instances of account theft and fraud related to websites that claim to provide you free V-Bucks or the ability to share or buy accounts. Please never share your Epic account details with anyone. Epic will never ask you for your password through email, social media, or a non-Epic website. Groups claiming to provide special Fortnite deals this way are fraudulent.

**How Do I Know If I’m At Risk?**

There is a fantastic web service ([Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)) that will let you search your email address and determine if it has been part of any data breaches. If it has, you should assume that the password associated with that service is public knowledge and change all accounts that use it (not just your Epic account!).

Even if your account information hasn’t been publicly identified as leaked, it’s possible that it may be leaked in the future, so there are steps that you can do to help protect yourself against that. You can start by signing up for the Have I Been Pwned [notification service](https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe) so you’re immediately alerted if your email is ever included in future dumps.

**What Are We Doing To Help?**

At Epic, we’ve been working hard to try to hunt down password dumps in order to proactively reset passwords for player accounts when we believe they are leaked online. While this approach involves a lot of manual work on our side, we believe that it prevents a significant amount of fraud. However, this approach doesn’t find every impacted account, or you might have created your Epic account after we checked a particular password dump.

As a result, we’re working to further automate our process to check our account database against password dumps to close the gap on identifying impacted users and resetting their passwords. We’re also working hard to enable multi-factor authentication in the next few weeks and plan to have an additional blog post with more details soon.

**Use Unique Passwords**

We recommend using unique passwords as a way to protect yourself from credential stuffing attacks. Having a unique password for every service will guarantee that one compromised account won’t lead to everything you own being stolen.

Of course, it can be hard to remember so many different passwords. Consider using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers) to help. Using a password manager, you can generate a unique password for every service and only remember a single strong password (for the password manager).

**Link Your Social Accounts For Extra Security**

Recently, we rolled out [support to integrate Facebook and Google](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2887180-how-do-i-sign-in-with-facebook-or-google-) logins with our Epic account system. This provides you several advantages.

First, you can log in without needing to use your Epic password, as long as you’re actively logged in to Facebook or Google on your browser. You’ll receive a login prompt asking you to authorize the activity and then will be let straight in.

Second, you can always use these login methods to regain access to the account in the event that it is locked due to invalid passwords. Due to the additional security measures provided through Google and Facebook login, you can set correspondingly more secure passwords for your Epic account and then not worry about using them due to the pass-through authentication with Google and Facebook.

**Install And Update Antivirus**

While antivirus and antimalware products won’t solve every problem, they will help keep your computer safe from a lot of threats. Epic doesn’t endorse any particular product, but you can [view a list of options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_antivirus_software) here along with the various features of each. Keeping your computer clean of unwanted software will again minimize the number of ways your account can be compromised.

**Keep Your Computer Up To Date**

You should always keep your operating system, installed software, and drivers as up to date as possible. Small bugs from outdated drivers or software can result in performance issues or other game stability issues while missed security updates could compromise your entire computer. Epic always recommends updating to the latest secure versions of software and operating systems.

**Don’t Trust Shared Systems**

Logging in from a shared computer (cyber cafes, libraries, a friend’s house, etc.), introduces additional risk. Only log in on shared systems controlled by people you trust. Just by logging into your account on a shared system, your credentials could be stolen and you have no real insight into how secure those machines are. 

If you’ve used an untrusted shared machine in the past, we recommend changing your password to ensure that it’s not compromised. If you play on a shared machine on a regular basis, it is critical that you use a unique password for your Epic account and make sure to log out of the launcher when finished each time.

**Enable Multi-factor Authentication When Possible**

Epic’s account doesn’t yet support multi-factor authentication, but we’re working to implement it as quickly as we can. We’re sorry this hasn’t come online sooner, and we’ll have an update on the status of this within the next two weeks. 

[Multi-factor Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) helps keep your account secure by requiring more than just a password. We recommend enabling it on every service you can. [This site](https://twofactorauth.org/) will let you review different services and see which support it.

**Don’t Share Accounts**

While sometimes you might struggle to complete that quest and would love for a friend or family member to help, we encourage you not to share your account information with others. Any actions committed on your account are your responsibility. If someone cheats on your account and it is banned, it is your responsibility as the account holder.

**Don’t Buy Accounts**

Sometimes, people get tired of a game and want to quit - and would like to get something for the time they’ve invested in the game. As a result, they’ll list their accounts online. While you might be tempted to purchase one and gain access to the sweet skins they have, please don’t. As the original account creator, they are likely in possession of significant facts that may enable them to recover the account through our Player Support process (such as transaction history, address history, etc.) by claiming you stole the account.

**There’s No Such Thing As A Free V-Buck**

We’ve seen the sites online, just like you. Click here, put in your username, maybe answer a survey question or two, and you’ll get as many free V-Bucks as you’d like. Those sites aren’t real. They want you to enter your account credentials into their page (enabling them to log in as you and create fraudulent charges) or else encourage you to click down a chain of advertising referrals, getting click-through advertising money for the person running the site. Under no circumstances are those sites able to actually grant V-Bucks. Our legal team is constantly prowling to hunt down those sites.

If you’ve tried one of them in the past, we encourage you to change your password as soon as possible. 

**Verify Email Address**

While it is currently optional, we ask that you please [verify your e-mail address](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2907132-how-do-i-verify-my-email-address-) associated with your Epic account. This will help protect your account when we implement multi-factor authentication and make it easier for Player Support to contact you in the event of any anomalous activity with your account.

**Player Support Details**

Need additional help? Our Player Support team is here for you. We have a [Fortnite Help Portal](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/) with answers to many of your questions.

If there’s anything where you feel we need to clarify further or something else you’d like assistance with, [feel free to e-mail in a request](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/customer/portal/emails/new).

I simply do not agree with this games jumping. It feels annoying and players can abuse it in combat. I feel like the jump is way too high, and at the same time not high enough. Frantically trying to get over fences while being chased is infuriating, And missing an almost perfectly placed shot because someone saw you at the last second, and simply press one button rather than having to build quickly or get into cover, is just plain annoying. Here is an idea for a solution.

I know fortnite isn't a realistic game. A bus propelled forward by an upwards facing balloon? A grenade that forces you to dance? but I still think that improvements can be made.

A climbing system.

""Oh, but Morgan, Morgan!"" I hear the distant cries ""PUBG added climbing! you just want fortnite to be a free-to-play version of that!"" no, I see a genuine problem here, And this is my silly little idea to try and fix it.

So, either epic removes jumping completely or makes the height of each jump waaaaaay smaller (I suggest the second one for a later idea). This could help fix the randomness of 1 V 1 shotgun fights in houses that just involve jumping around and trying to shoot something that moves way too fast and too annoyingly. Then, add some sort of climbing button. A single press of this button allowed you to quickly climb up whatever you're looking at, allowing you to scale those damned fences behind the fast food joints, fences behind a house and maybe even getting up the side of buildings. and maybe, a new kind of trap to stop people from trying to scale your forts!

However, there is one issue. Jumping from platform to platform. I have an idea, but it's not very good. Holding the jump button will place you into some sort of ""charging jump"" position, either slowing your movement or stopping you entirely while charging. On release, this will perform a jump wih more distance, allowing you to jump from crazy floating platform to crazy floating platform, and maybe with the suggested climbing system, if you barely make a jump, you'll grab onto the ledge and climb up, possibly creating some thrilling experiences.

I'm very sorry if you dislike this idea, please leave constructive criticism.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this!

I've had my own experiences facing a withering hail of bullets and it's not very fun.  

The common response is ""Just shoot back"" which is a fair comment but there are many situations that's not viable (e.g.  low health).  Building defenses, which is what makes Fortnite unique, is what allows you to recover/deflect the attack/push back, but that mechanic is simply unable to cope with a full on minigun barrage.

Current state, the minigun simply overwhelms the building mechanic.  I looked up the following stats.

- wood wall, starts with 100 HP and gains about 13 HP per half second up to 200
- brick wall, 90, 9 per, up to 300
- metal wall, 80, 9 per, up to 400

- purple minigun 192 damage per second
- gold 204 dps

So unless I'm totally off base, within that first second, there is no chance of offsetting the damage of the minigun because the moment your wall goes up, the minigun is pumping out 2x the damage.  This leads to spamming walls and hoping you don't get chipped down in between the builds.  Assuming you avoid chip damage, it's basically a resource/ammo attrition battle.

I'm not going to yell ""nerf"" without any thought put into it, but i would argue that a healthy minigun meta would be a situation where you can severely, that's the key word - ""severely"",  pressure a player but they retain a slight upper hand in building speed that if played perfectly, would give them islands of refuge - meaning, the wall they built gives them enough time to build a second wall as the first one is being destroyed. If a player is a fast builder, they could slowly build themselves out of danger or even push towards the player.  Right now, it seems it's more like build as fast as you can in place or rapidly backpedal hoping to get out of the line of fire.

How to achieve this?

- reduce fire rate in half so dps is on par with the initial HP of the wood wall
- people have suggested an overheat mechanism, that gives periodic relief (little different than what I'm suggesting but good idea as well)
- greatly enhance bloom at distance, so that a wall at 25 metres you land 100% of your bullets directly on the wall (Assuming you are aiming dead centre) but at 50 metres you may only be landing 50% of shots on target.  Alternatively, bloom increases with the number of bullets fired.  So you can do short accurate bursts that lose a little accuracy over 50-100 bullets but if you just hold down the fire trigger nonstop, by your 200th bullet, your hitting half the side of the mountain

I'd be curious to hear other thoughts and suggestions.  If there are any errors in the points above, please let me know.",FortNiteBR

I can drop popular places like Retail Row/Tilted and even come out of the area with 6-8 kills, so I know my general shooting game is above average.

If I can make it to top 5 I will win much more often than not even if I only have like 200 wood to my name, but theres something about the mid game that just gives me so much anxiety I never know what to do. When it comes down to the last few its like its so much less stressful to manage.

Either one of two things happen mid game: 

1) I end up running around in open fields looking for people, and hardly find anyone until some dude shoots me in the back and hits me for at least 1/3 of my health before I can panic build. Once I get my bearings on where he is I end up getting sniped at from another direction, and it turns into a pinch between 2-3 people wrecking my base until I go down.

2) I try to hit other popular areas and end up getting killed by a corner camper with a shotgun in a building who never made a sound upon my approach.

When I start getting frustrated I usually play a ""camping"" match myself where I land super out of the way, get basic load out going, and just chill in buildings riding the circle until top 10 and end up winning with like 2-3 kills (not trying to sound like a humble brag).

Winning that way just isn't as fun though... but I have no idea why I have such issues with the mid game, I feel like half of it is I just build a ton of anxiety looking for people and not finding anyone. Then everyone just pops out at once and I end up choking.

Anyone else in a similar purgatory with the mid game?",FortNiteBR

I understand the main point of the Minigun is having huge ammo capacity but give it between 100/200 ( or other value that works well in case this ends up being to low ) but not 999 as long as you have bullets for it that are fairly easy to collect.

Hurts further interest in the game","I'm sure quite a number of people were delighted to purchase the new Battle Pass as a way of supporting Epic for doing a great job with the game so far. 

In season 1, I played with a burning desire by creating random goals and coming up with ways of choosing the right path to fight enough people for good loot, but without taking too many fights to be unhealthy for the final showdown. Generally had a great time by being focused on the game and finding the best ways to enjoy the game.

Not much has changed from that mindset, it was always fun first, dailies second, and usually the dailies were completed as a collateral. As a thing for bonus xp that made me extra happy.

Now with season 2, the Battle Pass provided more dailies, which I was excited about at first. More bonus xp! Then I looked into the Battle Pass rewards and landed to the conclusion that I must do almost every daily quest in order to reach the max tier (70).

My focus got shifted from playing the game as the situation demands it, to completing the dailies and specifically changing strategies or giving up on interesting ideas in search of the daily quest requirement. Biggest reason behind that is time constraints. You know you must complete the daily or risk not getting the Black Knight skin. There were many nights where you had a busy day and you remember that you hadn't played Fortnite yet and the quests are getting reset in a couple of hours. It's a panic to do a chore - that's how it feels like. Instead of playing when you have time, you're trying to make time. I end up forcing Fortnite in my schedule just not to miss a daily. And by doing so - my love for the game started fading. I have no doubt this wasn't the intention with the Battle Pass system. This might encourage people to pay money for Battle Pass progression, but it still won't stop people from feeling like it's turning into a chore.

For example, you're alone for the night, you get a ""place top 6 in Squads"" daily. Unfortunate, but luckily you can reroll a daily once per day. Had times where it rerolls into ""place top 12 in Squads 5x"". That's a gut punch if you don't have a lot of time for games that day. 5 top 12's solo are definitely possible, it but it takes longer and at the end of the day, it's for no good reason.
Or even worse, turning down a match with friends because you have a Solo daily.

Before the Battle Pass there were days where Fortnite wouldn't get any play, then the next day you enjoy a lengthy session with utmost joy. 
After the Battle Pass dailies got introduced, i'm getting burned out from the game without even playing it like it should be played.
For people that can't play every single day, this is a big issue. I've looked up the topic before, not many upvotes, but people are definitely being affected by it. I know I'm not alone.
I really hope Epic recognizes the impact this could bring in the long term. Perhaps the next Battle Pass won't depend on dailies so much or at least allow the dailies to stack without logging in. 

TLDR: The Battle Pass dailies are killing my enjoyment of the game. Some dailies feel like a gut punch if you have time constraints and they distract from the game being played properly. If there was no reason to rely on dailies, they'd be easily ignorable, but now they're important and making them a priority is hurting further player interest in the game. ",FortNiteBR

We don’t need the vertical one back but the directional one was amazing.

Also, why did they make everything a spike trap? Damage Traps should still be grouped together but when you place them on ceilings they should turn into ceiling zappers. 
The fact that no trap makes sound is ridiculous. It’s pretty easy to spot them when you take your time but that’s just another thing we have to be paranoid about. We already have bush and tree campers lmao (honestly you shouldn’t be able to camp in trees unless branches break after a while forcing you to fall or something)

EDIT: Read the whole post. I’m not complaining about getting killed by traps, I’m just claiming it’s annoying that we have to spend the time looking for them.
This is really only a problem in Tilted. Trying to find someone in a massive building with no vertical audio is annoying when you also have to spend the time checking every wall, ceiling, and floor looking for traps.

But Fortnites aiming makes me want to turn the game off. It NEVER feels right, I never feel like the reticule is aiming where I want it to and isn't responding appropriately compared to the over shooters I play regularly. I've tried with and without aim assist on.

It might be worse than Halo 5's and that would be fucking saying something.

It was at the house way on the east side of retail. I was minding my own business when I hear your footsteps. My first reaction is to pull out my pump since you're in close proximity to where I can hear your steps. I looked around to find the culprit. I make a full 360 and when I finished there you were out of the blue. Just as I was about to shoot you drop bandages and waved. At this point I am so bamboozled. Shook. And then you left. I didn't need the bandages. I hesitated to shoot you as you walked away but I couldn't bring myself to do it. What kind of person would I have been? I ended up dying that game but I hope you won it buddy. ,FortNiteBR

Like this person [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7vd73y/everyones_worried_about_not_being_able_to_play/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7vbn80/ive_been_hacked_and_dont_know_what_to_do/), I too was a victim of a compromised account, and with the **CREDIT CARD** on file, I was charged nearly **$500** in V-Buck purchases, with MANY more attempted, upwards of $1,000. I am honestly terrified, and I have no idea what to do as I have 25 dollars left in my account, and I don't have enough to pay my bills (no sob story, just the truth). I have sent 2 seperate e-mails, one pertaining to my account name and password being changed, and another through their proper form. I can't call the bank as it is far too late right now, and the game was bought with the card on file as a gift (Any payment option has since been promptly deleted)

I am meticulous with my Internet security, so I am not only financially wounded, but also at a loss for how my account was compromised.

*Edit: It appears that Epic has promptly corrected the problem and returned the money. I have since cleared my 5 most recent passwords, and reinstalled my OS (It needed it anyway).

*Edit 2: I appreciate the insight. For those of you who keep asking about the correlation, I really don't know. I pretty much only play Overwatch, and honestly haven't played Fortnite since the beginning of January. No password sharing, and as far as I can tell, I wasn't phished. I always opt for any 2FA whenever is an option, but normally in these circumstances, the support sends a warning message to my email and tells me where the suspicious IP is from, and none of this happened. Best advice is to remove any form of payment, as in my case, they simply changed password, logged in game, and bought V Bucks with one click and no CCV authorization. ",FortNiteBR

Ready to uninstall it and give up.","So I want to enjoy this game. I really do. I absolutely loved my first hour playing it. But after spending about 5 hours playing it, playing it just makes me upset and angry, even though I feel like it should be fun. The reason is, I lose every single 1v1. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even if I nab a shield potion first minute of the game, and see someone before they see me, I still die. I'm a PC gamer who has been playing hundreds of hours of Overwatch, so I don't think aim is the issue. Also I'm not really looking for squads, I imagine that might help some, but I want a game I can use to relax when I'm alone, not a game where I need to co-ordinate with people (which is my problem with Overwatch). 

I think the biggest problem is there is no training mode. I have no way to learn how Fortnite handles shooting. Do I hold the trigger down or click several times? Are the mechanics hitscan or projectile? What do the different weapons feel like and how do they differ? The only reasons I know the answers to some of my questions is that I spent an hour this weekend watching Youtube, and that's not enough to build up the muscle memory. It sounds to me like Fortnite's answer to this is to spend hundreds of hours playing it, and honestly, I value my time too much for that.

FortniteBR only offers me two ways to try weapons, the first being an actual game, and the second being the matchmaking arena. The matchmaking arena is a brilliant idea. However, I'm only there for about 20 seconds at a time. I'd honestly love it if I could stay in the matchmaking arena. Also the opponents are invincible and I spawn without weapons or materials, making it even less effective at training.

I think the second biggest problem is that from what I've read there is no way to split players by skill. This means that I'm probably playing against several people who have been playing Fortnite as a full time job even during my first time trying the game.

I did recently read a tip that helped some. If you need practice, jump off the bus immediately and head to cities where everyone else is. It's bad for winning, but great for practice. Also this way I can ignore building as in the first few seconds no one has building materials. I feel like building is something that will be harder to learn, so I want to work on my gun skills first. The only problem is I have died probably 10 out of 10 times in the last hour trying this. I got more experience, but now I'm feeling upset and angry and even more frustrated than before, instead of having any fun at all.

My first hour of Fortnite I was having so much more fun than Overwatch, but now after a few more hours of losing nearly every single 1v1 I've ever been in, I'm just not having fun anymore to the point where I'm giving up and uninstalling it. I love the ideas and the premise of it, but I'm finding this game is really unplayable for your average gamer who needs a bit of help learning how to play a game when they start. Hopefully the developers can learn how to work these issues out, I know it's in beta still and I'm probably being unfair to it, though I would expect even a beta to have a training area. I honestly feel very disappointed right now, as someone who really wanted to play FortniteBR, loved my first hour of it, and then grew to hate it over the next few days.",FortNiteBR

&gt; Goal #1 – Pistol sniping at long range should not be possible.
   Goal #2 – Our weapons should have characteristics that         encourage a wide range of engagements based on: distance to target, target type, ammo availability, etc.


**Did they achieve any of these goals even remotely?**


Not at all. In fact, EpicGames went backwards.


First off, by *nerfing shotguns* you make their use at close range a nightmare and make players try their hardest to keep fights to medium or long range, by having such little damage they are now worse than every other gun except snipers at close range. It should not take a full clip of shotgun ammo to point blank kill someone whilst hitting every shot.


However, by *nerfing distance shooting* you made long range fights something to ignore as well, as weapons can not hope to keep up with building, ever, at that range. The *only* weapon worth using at that range is now the sniper, which does nothing to prevent people sitting back spamming walls and killing pvp.


**The reason you shouldn’t copy other BR games or CSGO in terms of PVP is because we have BUILDING**


There’s a good reason for having Bloom, that’s because it is suitable for the game and only slight modifications are necessary. Making guns terrible and painful to use just makes the game boring and slow, it makes people avoid fights and reduces the skill gap massively:


You are now nearly guaranteed to take damage every fight, meaning players will sit back and interrupt fights. We will be seeing a sluggish, PubG level of gameplay where the whole game is centred on avoiding fights and looting.


**What can we do to making fighting better?**


Build on our strengths, not our weaknesses. Building is the main difference between our game and a copypadsta BR game, add new mechanics to building such as the option to edit or rearrange your building hotbar to include custom presets before the games start, as a permenant add-on until updated.


Reduce the accuracy of light guns the farther into the clip they get, such as making silenced pistols bloom widen in a similar fashion as the mini gun. 


Perfect accuracy? How about for just the first shot, to give players an advantage for attacking but not for staying still and lasering. How about we just not mess with recoil, the bloom crosshair gives an effect of recoil already by giving bullet spray, and we can imagine the character is controlling the kick off the gun himself.

Heres the OC i made to the OP in the subreddit for those that dont wish to visit it but still want a overview of the lightning effects used:

 You can edit the static base layer to meet your keybinding in game since i moved my inventory slots around to include ~ for pickaxe and Q for Slot 1. Also since 3.0 gives a few more options with the effects, the lightning effect that plays when you move and switch weapons will turn off all the lights for a split second just in the area of your movement and weapon slots. When 3.0 exports ill update with the much better version.

(Hopefully EPIC!) I spent the past few hours trying out the new shooting test and I have to say, it's the best thing that happened to the game. Why do I say that?

1. I felt the game was more about aiming instead of spamming and hoping a bullet would hit someone.
2. It opens up a skill gap. I felt that I beat more people that had less hours of experince then me on the game.
3. It feels much more satisfying getting kills because you award yourself for taking the time to aim and fire. 
4. There's millions more reasons why the test is amazing but these were the key highlights. KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK EPIC! ",FortNiteBR

Teamkilling was a huge issue, and I get that, but I wonder if turning it off creates a bigger problem. 

&amp;nbsp;

There's a very large population of young players on this game. In some respects, that's great! More fun for everyone. But sometimes younger players don't want to take the game as seriously, and can easily ruin the game for someone else. Case in point:

&amp;nbsp;

I thought I would try out the limited time mode today, and got grouped with a guy who followed me, took all of the loot from my chests, and didn't contribute at all. Okay, whatever. I let him follow me around, down a guy, but lose like 50 health. I ask him if I can have my bandages back, multiple times. He understands me because he dances...but refuses to give them back. 

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, whatever. I go on to down another guy, and the guy drops small shields. Said bandage hogging teammate does nothing, but he DOES proceed to run over to the body and pick up all the small shields. I ask if I can have them back. He dances again. At this point I decide I'm done with the game and just run off the cliff, but it's frustrating to have no way of dealing with or punishing the player in question. All I can think is that maybe he was a very young dude, but if not, it pisses me off that someone mature enough to know the difference just wasted so much of my time.

&amp;nbsp;

So my main idea is, maybe having it off encourages people to troll? I get that before it was a big issue with people shooting people for better weapons, but there has to be a better way to deal with people like this. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Before I start, please keep a couple things in mind. I played a match of the original shooting test when it was turned on by accident and I'm by no means a pro. Here we go...
I like the new shooting model. It's a huge step in the right direction. I can't say that it's really what I was hoping for though. After that one match of the original shooting test, nothing will ever feel as good except that or some variation of it. I LOVE that my first shots take skill now, but I hate that the rng penalizes us for moving while firing as much as it still does. Why should we the players be penalized so hard for trying to avoid getting shot? In my years of shooter experience, I've never experienced something so demeaning. Look at battlefield. Yes, accuracy and recoil and everything are way worse while moving, but it's still not rng. There is still skill in the moving and shooting. You can tap fire, crouch to improve recoil, etc to help while moving into cover or peaking from cover. Having rng AT ALL removes vital gun skill from the game in a big way. This test is a good thing, but I really don't see myself enjoying fortnite much more if this becomes the norm. Now, part of my opinion may be biased by the fact that I've been playing solo squad in this test and I normally play solo gametype. It puts more pressure on me and that may have swayed my thought process. I just can't see how this brings any extra skill into the game when most of us have learned to keep that tiny dot on people and pray. Now we just keep it on people, don't move, and have to fire super slow, then get penalized for moving. Just my opinion. 
I LOVE that we finally have this test and one more at least and please don't take this as a bunch of negativity. It's just my thoughts based on what I've played both last ""test"" and the current one. 
EPIC, y'all freaking rock and keep up the excellent work...maybe fix a few more bugs before adding more stuff. 😜

Because shotguns cannot one-shot anymore, there are situations where it is nearly impossible to outplay your opponent if they get the jump. Let's say you start getting shot in the back. Your opponent gets several headshots leaving you with 1hp. You manage to build and now your attacker is rushing you with a shotgun.

In the current build, if you have a pump shotgun, you have the opportunity to upset the fight with a well placed headshot. In the new build, it is much more difficult because you have to land two shots. Shotty fights often result in players trading damage with one another if neither party gets a clean headshot. 

IMO CQC should be dangerous as it allows for upset potential with good aim. In the future build if you're attacked first and your opponent rushes you, it will be extremely difficult to come back from.

I'm 100% in favor of all the current changes, minus the damage fall off on the scoped AR.  The shotgun nerf puts the smg's in a better spot with their buff, and fights fought at a distance can stay at a distance instead of just charge building close enough until you can double pump.  

However, the scoped AR has taken a back seat in this game for a long time, and is consistently a weapon i never pick up.  IMO, it should be 100% accurate while NOT moving, and have bloom thrown in if you shoot while moving.  This gives it a risk/reward element.  It should also either NOT have the damage fall off applied, or have the range at which the fall off starts GREATLY increased. 

Currently, the scoped AR feels like the fall off is in the same place as other AR's.  With the damage being closer to SMG's now instead of AR's, it just doesn't seem to have a place in this game at all.  Just my thoughts, could be wrong.  ",FortNiteBR

If I cannot 1 pump someone with a perfect accuracy headshot, I don't want to play the game. Its a move towards slowing and casualizing a game that simply doesn't need it. A perfect aimed blast to the head from s green pump not Killing will take the sails out of ya.  Fortnite will be less rewarding to play and watch.  I'll run down a quick list of points.

1. The tac is already almost trash.  Making it even more trash does NOT help the issue.  Currently on live it's semi viable but making it even do less damage will not make me want to run it ever.  3 shot with near perfect accuracy. On 100/100 which will hardly every happen. 

2. In the old shooting model single pump was viable as you could do massive burst damage to compete with with tac and build for tempo.  Currently a single pump is so much more meh. Loosing the chance to swing a losing fight with a clutch shot is gone.

3.  It forces the double  pump.  In the new shooting model double pump is hardly affected as it's still likely a 2 tap on 100/100 targets.  Fighting double pump with a single  pump is no longer viable and tac is worse.  Double pump will be the only Consistent option for close range. Nothing outside of building will be able to compete with it.

4.  Smg buff.  I think it's great you want to buff smgs but the buff is actually substantiational as hell and doing it at the same time as nerfing shotties is wrong. It will turn some close range encounters into a spam fest where smg players can actually out spray good aimed shotties(especially pump)  and good players will leave fights very hurt when in today's game they likely would have escaped unphased. 

5.  Mini gun.  First off i think its balanced due to its weaknesses but i hate the gun.  Currently it is incredibly difficult if not completely unviable to defensive build against a mini gun and not take damage which in it's own right hurts the skill gap immensely,(great defensive builder Vs. spraying  nub is sonewhat even) but now in close range a pump headshot won't put the mini gunner down which is not good, since landing that shot is easy and your likely to just die after one shot.  Bascially double pump him or risk dying.  


Aggression is already being nerfed the mini gun, shottie nerfs now, and good players might be happy that their ar might be alot more accurate, but they wont like this Patch and you better get used to them ars.  In this current model being tested the only consistent ways to win will be sit in a 1X1 with a scar and laser everyone, or run double pump. 

Not happy about this, except the scoped ar buff that part is cool.",FortNiteBR

I received error messages in game as I was getting kicked from matches, but due to my stupidity thought nothing of it. Sure enough, Saturday comes by and my account is disabled. (cue crushed soul).

I know that there is no possible way for you guys to know if I am telling the truth and that I did not hack, but I guess I'm just desperate and trying to reassure myself that I did nothing wrong. Fortnite has been my gateway game where I could just relax, play with my friends, grind, and be stress free, but ever since my account has been disabled I can't really do that and it hurts. I had already contacted support and got a reply that basically outed me as a cheater and informed me that my account has been permanently banned.

I guess what I'm saying here is that I am sorry, I'm sorry for my stupidity, and sorry for not being careful. I absolutely love the game and adore the devs for their constant transparency and frequent updates through tough times with server issues and downtimes. I am just praying that someone from epic sees this post and believes in me and through some sort of miracle my account will be unbanned. Again, I'm very sorry and would like to thank anyone who read this and actually believes me. I swear to you that I would never cheat in a game that I love so much and spent money in order to support the devs.

Here is my take on the Shooting test so far.

* Shotguns are much less effective now.  The do less base damage and the range was drastically reduced.  Even the pump starts damage drop off after only a few steps.
* SMGs feel a lot stronger at CQC fights now.  I've lost several close quarter fights when I had a shot gun and the smg burned me down between me doing 60-70 per blast.
* While ARs do less damage per shot, they seem to kill quicker if you pace your shots (with head shots hitting more often) due to the first shot accuracy.
* Revolvers are going to be the new meta... Just wait for the red dot on your reticle, double Revolvers will most likely replace the double pumps.
* Aim assist seems to have been turned down a bit.  Nothing really to back this up, other than anecdotal evidence.  It just felt less sticky, and other players seem to be missing more often than usual",FortNiteBR

The skillgap suffers because of this, and thats not a good thing (just look at destiny 2).

When a player logs in, they have the option to hold a button and speak the 'catch phrase' into their mic to be granted the 'With Mic' status.

Players are then given a new squad/duo fill option -&gt; 'Fill With Mic'.

1. Compass number
2. Direction (""moving left to right"", ""running away from us"")
3. Distance (close - far/deep is fine for this)
4. Landmark (""by the RV"", ""in the garage"")
5. Outfit (if you can see and call these out, bonus)

So a fully developed call-out would be something like: 

""Two guys 150 going left towards the shack next to modern, one is dressed like a giant ham sandwich, pretty far from us""

Hope this helps some of you. Happy gaming.

Doesn't matter if you want to improve your K/D or simply grind more wins in your solo matches, or you want to try out solo vs squads! Or if you have trouble closing matches, or even if you feel like you don't know what you are doing midgame once you have all the loot you want and the circle is on you! 

No problem! I can &amp; **will** help you!

My name's fuN and I have been playing Fortnite BR since november 17. This past month I have made some huge improvements in my game and I want to share! You can check my stats on the fortnite tracker network! Important is what i have achieved in the shortrun. 8+ K/D in over 130 Matches. (https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/fuN1337)

Besides, I am an experienced CS:GO player with over 3,3k hours. I am currently in Rank G (semi pro league) competing for a spot in Rank S (Pro league). I have played in different teams and I competed in the Austrian Pro League in the first Season (csgo.alpenscene.at)


I want to share everything i have learned about fortnite and help players like you to become the next Fortnite God! (Or brag in front of your friends ;)

I will coach the first 10 that are interested for free! Why? I want to improve as a coach and I want your feedback and criticism!

*For the first 10 I only have a few requirements:

- I will do 2 sessions of 45 Minutes each (will be scheduled for your comfort) (**you don't have to go for 2 sessions if you don't want to, I just think it makes sense to discuss after a week how you improved/changed with my suggestions**)
- You need to have a microphone and headset and be able to hop on discord
- Be 18+ ; I want to start on adults first, because of:
- Feedback. Please let me know if I could help you. Let me now what I could do better! Don't be shy; be mean if necessary, I can take it!
- Speak english, german or italian!

Not a requirement but preferred:

- Stream! If you can stream to twitch and I could watch your games, that would be perfect and even easier for me to analyze your Pros/Cons


I will try my best to personalize the coaching for your playstyle!



PS: It doesn't matter if you are on PC/Console - I prefer if you played on PC tho.

PPS: If this goes well I will be opening the coaching sessions for Kids U18 as well!


EDIT: **The first 10 spots have been taken**
If you are still interessted, I would advice you to wait for the first coaching sessions to end and see the results/feedback. If you don't want to wait I can make room for you for a small fee of 5$ for 1.5 hours!",FortNiteBR

You can choose what weapons / amount of resources, health etc you are allowed at the start of the match.

There will be several scenarios. There could be a situation where your enemy is on top of a mountain, and you are at the bottom. Your enemy is given 10 seconds to build a base whilst you are frozen. After the 10 seconds, you have to push their base and try and kill them. Other scenarios include regular flat ground base pushing, which would lead to some interesting building competitions.

I believe something like this would be great in introducing new people to the game, giving them an easy, non-punishing way of learning, while also developing and challenging the better players against each-other, and it would also be quite a lot of fun.

The only problem I have with this is that it doesn't seem to suit the game, though, the developers would find a great way to introduce it.

* Building bugs- lag when going into build mode, wrong pieces still being selected when trying to choose quickly, building parts rotated when never chosen to rotate.
* Can't fire weapon after pickup- self explanatory.
* Having to emote to bring up ""lost"" pickaxe.
* Sound direction is unreliable, as well as distance you can hear people now. (I use a incredibly good headset and soundwhore like a bitch) people 10 feet behind me aren't making noise anymore.
* Doors not being able to be closed again after opening them.
* Muddy textures due to them not loading in fast enough despite great internet. Prevents you from entering or destroying the walls of the texture.
* Unable to pickup downed enemies weapon for XX amount of time.
* I've only seen this once but- picking up a minigun and it turning into bandages when entering your inventory. I forgot to save the clip as I was mid-firefight and lost and closed the game out of frustration.
* Vcoins mysteriously disappearing and reappearing later and disappearing again.
* Breaking down a wall for it to not disappear despite being destroyed only to disappear after you left the vicinity (probably server lag)
* Hit markers with no damage to people.
* Direct impact RPGs doing 0 damage
* ""Zombie"" body animations from people downed and revived causing you to mistake them for either being downed or not being able to hit them because they appear to be at 2X the normal movement speed.
* Forts with base destroyed on the side of a mountain not demolishing and staying suspended in air until you break another random wall. 
* Opening a chest for it to be empty or it's contents falling through the floor.
* Chest sounds still failing to trigger when close by.
* Crosshair randomly disappearing for no reason.

I've filed for fraud with my bank and the police, and have contacted EpicGames through a couple of different channels and am just waiting to hear back. I'm now going through and changing all my passwords and will be downloading a new security system - any recommendations?

People, stop calling “OP” for every item that is added, and wait a few days. More than half of the added items are irrelevant and people have just ignored them. I’ll go through them:

**Slurp Juice.** Slurp Juice was the first thing added to the game. It’s used mostly as a way to get above 75 hp and 25 shields while you’re at it. It sounds like a great addition, if it weren’t for the rarity compared to mini shields and medkits. If you find one of these early game, great. 25 shield. The only time I think of these as useful is mid-game, but nobody is gonna be carrying around those that far in, unless you are. People would 100% pick 3 mini shields or 1 medkit over these.

**The Bush.** This one was added more of as a meme, because when it was added, bush campers were running rampant. When it was first added, you could see through it when ADS and it gave you 2. Sure, I see where it could be OP in squads at that time. 4 bushes that could hide in plain sight and see through it. But honestly, in solos, when is somebody gonna carry an extra one of these rather than a medkit? Since the addition, it has been nerfed into the ground. You now cannot see through it, making close range fights a pain. Also, people look hard for bush campers. Nobody that has played more than 5 hours is gonna run by a spinning, moving bush.

**Launch Pad.** The launch pad is extremely fun to use and very relevant. 

**Silenced SMG.** It’s always fun when new guns are added. Too bad the meta completely ruins new guns that are added. Who’s gonna replace their shotgun with a silenced SMG? It’s only used in early game fights, when you gotta use whatever gun you got. After that it is usually dropped.

**Mini Shields.** My favorite addition to the game. These are useful out of and in fights. Everyone picks up 5 of these over 15 bandages. 

**Smoke Grenade.** Do I really need to say anything about these?

**Boogie Bomb.** I will admit boogie bombs were OP for the time they were in the game. Being able to do absolutely nothing against an enemy is not fun nor fair. The devs have now made it so it only lasts 5 seconds and you lose it apron being shot. These are practically useless. Not to mention it only gives you 1 apon picking it up, and it’s blue rarity, so you’re probably gonna find 3 of these max in a game. The only thing people use these for are having spontaneous dance parties with their squad. 

**Silenced Pistol.** Same as the SMG. Shotgun&gt;silenced pistol all day.

**Chug Jug.** Very relevant and balanced by the fact that it takes 15 full seconds to drink. 

**Mini Gun.** A very fun fun to use, and I pick these over grenade launchers all the time. Tears through bases and is horrible in 1v1’s where the enemy knows what they’re doing. Please don’t nerf the Mini Gun.


That’s it. I know there’ll be some exceptions saying “I always take a Silenced Pistol” or “Smoke grenades are so fun!”

Assault Rifle, Pump Shotgun, Tactical Shotgun, RPG/Launcher, Mini-Shields.

I posted a few threads on here asking for advice at 200 games played and 300 games played trying to get that illusive win. 

I listened to what people said and began playing passive at the beginning and staying to the smallest area of the circle, moving precisely and only engaging when I know I have at least a 70% chance of winning. 

Once it got to end game (top 10), I got myself into a good position and started to play a bit more aggressively, picking my spots. I ended up killing 5 of be top 10 and getting their loot. 

I built up and i looked over to see final two. My nerves were through the roof as I knew I had a good position to win. The other guy jump padded onto my building. I  chucked on a roof and sat it out waiting for his next move. I made an exit door, he ran and created a shitty wood 1x1. I shot that shit open and hammered him. Boom! #1 Victory Royale!

The funny thing about this win? I played a solo game straight after and won again 😂. It’s amazing how much better you play when the first solo win monkey is off your shoulders!

One issue I run into all the time is sensitivity. I can't change my look around sensitivity and it gets me killed so many times because I barely move my mouse and I lose track of the target. (Full 360 is done in 2in of mouse movement) Please get this noticed because I really want this to be changed it would make the game so much better for me.,FortNiteBR

What I meant, was that those who have some kind of knowledge about servers should be working on the server issues, even though they might be better at other stuff.

I see a lot of people saying that you should stop focusing on giving us new content like new weapons etc. every update, and focus more on the re-occurring server issues. But there are also a lot of people who want new content as well as the servers to be fixed. So I have a suggestion:
Dedicate a portion of your team to work exclusively on fixing the server issues, and the rest on new updates. This way, the servers would hopefully become more stable, and we would still get new content, although the new content would take more time to arrive, which I believe everyone would be okay with :)",FortNiteBR

I understand the game is still early access and theres going to be bugs but when you guys are just rolling out patches left right and center with more and more bugs each patch its getting frustrating.. right now some chests arent giving loot, I get no crosshair when fighting sometimes, the building feels way slower since switching back (less building bugs which is good but building is slower), and right now, basically nobody can even log in. In no way am I trying to bash epic I love this game and wouldnt spend so much time on it if I didnt, but I think its time to focus on the bugs rather then content.

After playing for a few days, I've noticed a recurring pattern:

First 2 minutes of the match: 30~50 players die because they couldn't find a weapon after skydiving. No issue there...

Next ~5 minutes: The remaining players had a good starting chest loot, they are confident and 20 of them are about to die. I call them ""the duelists"". No issues there either...

Now, the storm will show its second safe region where everyone must run to, this is where the ""campers"" come into play.
These people usually drop in a house in the middle of the map, they loot the place then they run to a highland or hide in a bush... then wait. It's almost certainly somebody trying not to be caught by the storm will run into their trap and die without having the chance for any reaction, still that's fine. No issues there either...

The thing is this:
They won't touch a single tree, rock or container for materials. All they do is hide and wait for a victim, kill, get their items and materials.

I believe this is anti-game.

Consider removing the drop of MATERIALS from players when they die. This would increase strategical thinking in the game and would encourage more players to actually WORK FOR THEIR MATERIALS!

You killed me?! Fine, take my purple guns. Take my ammo... But man! I worked my ass off for those 400+ bricks / 400+ metals! Losing it to someone sitting in a bush is absolutely infuriating!
And now, just like everybody else, I simply never touch a single tree, stone or car anymore. I wait for people to die and loot from them, because collecting anything from the map is currently a waste of time (unless you stop drop materials from players)... Which makes the game experience not as rich as it could be.",FortNiteBR

Just reinstalled fortnite after a long hiatus and I've found that using any keyboard input when I'm on menu or in game freezes the game for me. Letting go of the key will unfreeze the game, but this makes it unplayable for me because any key I press will freeze the screen. This has never happened to me before on any other game or on fornite, so I would appreciate any help.

To sum up how the current shield and health system works, good players are punished if RNG does not help them find shields. There is nothing worse than losing a fight because your opponent has 200 HP compared to your 75, even if you land many more hits than them. I'm not saying I have a solution but there needs to be discussion regarding an overhaul.  

My suggestion is lowering damage of guns a tad and make the shields work as a damage mitigator instead of extra health. After a certain amount of hits the shield would ""break"". An example: a player has half a shield on, instead of being hit for 20 DMG per AR shot he's hit for 15 DMG per shot - after 5 shots the shield breaks.

In summary, the health/shield system is imbalanced and a discussion needs to be happening regarding a fix.",FortNiteBR

 I think there needs to be some sort of immediate, recognisable presence of a punishment for teamkilling. I *know* Epic Games have been pushing hard towards banning players responsible and their feedback is phenominal, but I'm just not seeing a difference in games at the moment. I don't think people are getting the message unless they physically see something happening.

I play squads a fair amount by myself with 3 randoms. It's a nice break from solos when I can't find 3 other friends. If I was being completely honest with zero exaggeration, I'd say I get teamkilled anywhere between 25-33% of the time in games. Sometimes it's immediate, other times my team waits for me to loot an entire area, 15 minutes into the game and then kills me for whatever I've found.

The wooden planks grant wood on destruction, allowing players to build and outplay their attackers! But other survivors aren't the only thing you should watch out for...

Instead of the usual storm aspect of the game, The Lava slowly rises up continually from ground level (not the wooden platform, the ground below), making building up a requirement. But do it safely! Because if you stay at the same level for too long, you might get burnt! 

We at Epic Games are going extremely excited to bring you this new way of playing our game. We hope that you have fun playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it!

Currently, scoped ARs are the 2 lowest DPS ARs in the game. Blue or purple, they are garbage. There is no getting around that fact. They have low damage, log mag size, and a low rate of fire for the tradeoff of what? A scope that gives next to no magnification. They may be accurate, but they have nothing to back that up. On top of all of this, a purple scoped AR is a possible drop in supply drops. This is by far the most underwhelming possible option from a supply drop, and whenever you get one you feel like taking the risk to get that supply drop wasn't worth it. This weapon is the only gun (with the exception of the SMGs) that I feel has no situation where i want it. I'd rather have a sniper for long range, and even at the medium-long range where this gun is supposed to be good, I'd perfer to tap-fire a scar.

#My Suggestion

Buff the damage on the blue from 23 to 28 and buff the Purple from 24 to 30. This would give the purple scoped but not the blue the ability to one-tap someone at 75 health.

#TLDR

The scoped rifles should encourage precision with more damage than they currently have as a tradeoff for lower mag size and fire rate ",FortNiteBR

We finally would get an analog of PUBG boosts - an item to restore health over time (allowing to do other stuff), another item to give shields, and, most importantly, **heal above 75** without using Med Kits.

Now, shield component of it is fine by itself (in my humble experience). Healing 25 health is not enough value, and shields by themselves are very debatable and controversial balance topic, but in the current game state with Shield Potions being as they are, 25 shield from Juice in my opinion is perfectly fine.

The main problem comes from it's rarity. What is the point of having a booster if it's second highest rarity (though in my experience Med Kits are quite rarer than an ""uncommon"" item should be), meaning that in context of an average game it's ridiculously rare for a player to see one. 

My current schedule allows me to play at least ~7 solo games per day (with some fill squads here and there; I don't have friends to play with), and I often don't encounter Juice (not even use, just see the object in the game world) even once per day. Sure, some of this depends on where I go and what I do, but I am a moderately active player - Ioften drop into mainstream spots, but I do not seek all the fights (it's solo's after all), I almost never die instantly and open at least 1 treasure chest per game - normally about 3-4. And I've gotta say - ~~fuck grey SMG and bandages~~ I have better chances going for Supply Drop with an empty inventory.

Also I watch 2-3 hours of streams during evening - Summit, Ninja, CDN - and on average they barely see Slurps as well.

So that's the thing. Effect balance-wise I think Slurps are perfectly fine, but they simply cannot do what they are supposed to because they are **too rare**. It's dumb that with a dedicated booster in game, your best chance to heal that last 25 hp is using a Med Kit, which is stupid because it's supposed to be a ""best Green Health value"" type of heal, 10 seconds of being afk for 25 hp is not what you want (naturally it varies on situation and how many Kits you have).

So please make Slurps a common item. Green rarity and drop rate of green SMG's/Shotguns should be perfectly fine. If it proves to be too good, remove the shield/reduce the shield/make it unusable at 100 Health/cap shield gain. Current health/heal meta *needs* and actualy obtainable booster.

As a side note, stack size of 2 is too small. In an ideal situation agressive player with 3 weapons and bandages and Slurps witll want to get to 100 much more often (even if Juice stays in it's current form). And now we have *smoke* nades, a traditionally limited usability item in any kind of shooter, come in stacks of 5. Seems stupid.

**TL;DR** - for what it's supposed to do Slurp is stupidly rare, make it an actually usable boost item by making it spawn more often, something like uncommon (green SMG's, Shotguns), limit/remove shield component if balance problems arise.",FortNiteBR

I'm beyond pleased to formally announce the new additions to our moderation team.  As this subreddit has continued to grow we've seen a pretty incredible level of traffic from this community, and have been on the lookout for outstanding members of the Fortnite family to assist us in managing the load.  Thank you to all 130 of you that submitted applications for the latest round, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the applicant pool!

First, welcome /u/TinyTimothy22 and /u/aFrequ!  These two have actually been with the team for most of the last month, dutifully doing what they can to help develop the community.

Timothy jumped out right away as a helpful, level-headed, and active member of the community, and one we could not overlook when it came time to expand the team.  Timothy is also a moderator (and elite player) of r/RocketLeague, and we look to leverage his experience with a large gaming subreddit as this place continues to expand.

We're also thrilled to have aFrequ join us!  Those of you that play Save the World and frequent r/Fortnite are undoubtedly familiar with one of the top PvE players in the game, and we jumped at the opportunity to have him join the team here on the BR side.  aFrequ is also a moderator on r/Fortnite, and we're excited to have another moderator with experience managing the community around this game.

Last but certainly not least, welcome /u/SergeantTiller!  Today marks Tiller's first day on the job, who will primarily be the steward of the castle in the ""overnight"" shift.  Tiller also comes with experience on a number of other subreddits, including getting r/FortniteRoyaleLFG up and running to allow players a spot on Reddit to squad up.  While we headhunted Timothy and aFrequ, Tiller's application rose to the top of a very competitive open process, and we're thrilled to add another exemplary community member to the moderation team.

The ARs completely shred you right now and there's no real reason to even go looking for a scar anymore given that between a standard AR and a scar you're looking at a few extra damage points. However my main concern is that this game is turning more into a game of complete chance with skill being less and less relevant. If you get hit by someone the mechanics of this game should at least enable you to build some defence. Right now you can have legendary reaction time and you won't even get one wall off because both the accuracy of this game and the damage points combined makes this game more about who sees who first not staying true to a battle of skill but of pure luck. 

My suggestion is to please buff up the Hit points in this game and also decrease weapon damage. The blue AR should have a max damage of 25 and head shot should be 50. Lower scar damage too please and increase recoil if you must because shredding people had just become to easy. You only get one life in this game please don't make the ttk as low as something like Cod's is.

My second suggestion is to please allow bandages in this game to provide you with at least full health. Right now I have to use two spaces in my inventory because of the ttk of this game one allocated to a medkit and the other bandages. 

In my honest opinion I think there shouldnt be a gun that can kill you with 3 body shots the most damaging should kill you 4 body shots at 100% health and 7-8 with full shield. 

One other important mention I'd like to make is please do something about the pumpkin rocket impact to players in close range. So many players are using as a one shot kill weapon with absolutely no skill requires at all. Reduce its effect to players for the sake of the game and keep the same impact on buildings.",FortNiteBR

Here's a quick list of some possible features that in my opinion Epic could add/change in the game to create a better experience for players. Feel free to disagree, I'm all for discussion. 
Note: this list does not include points that Epic have already commented on such as duos in Oceania (coming December), the cosmetic situation, loading times, team killing etc.

- Fine-tune the areas where it is available to build structures on, as in some areas (such as the container yard) it is difficult trying to build up to chests. Objects such as containers are surely sturdy enough and shaped correctly to be able to have structures such as stairs be built on them.
- Remove the delay after destroying particular objects (such as doghouses, basement doors, garage doors etc.) It can mean the difference between surviving and dying, especially in early game. (I know this has been requested many times)
- Increase the amount of metal gained from destroying containers. 1-2 metal per pickaxe swing is extremely inefficient compared to everything else.
- Allow other players in your party to see certain statistics, such as your level, kills, and games played. The customisable banner feature is currently practically useless, so perhaps implement that in more too.
- Switch the map and inventory buttons on combat pro controller to the same buttons used in the default settings, as it currently makes no sense having them swapped around.
- When changing settings, the 'apply' button needs to do its job and actually apply the changes. Every time I want to change region/sensitivity/controls, I have to repeatably keep reapplying the change until it finally works. (problem on PS4, I can only speak from own experiences)
- When being revived, sometimes the 10-second timer never pops up, and sometimes if multiple people try to revive some DBNO player, the little white circle gets stuck for the rest of the match next to their name. Not a big deal but just small bugs.
- Not sure if this mechanic is in the game on purpose, but I don't think items on the ground should be stuck if a structure is built on top of them. Late game can be a huge pain trying to grab a specific loot item quickly but having to destroy a metal wall to access it.
- Add some more rewards and features for winning. For example, the amazing end summary screens some users have created, which show the events of the game, an end kill cam or play of the game, and some actual rewards for finishing #1 such as a few vbucks or another currency
- In my opinion, regular SMGs still need to be made a more viable option, as their suppressed counterparts seem much stronger, let alone shotguns.
- As the launch pads have been implemented, I think the jump-pads should receive a buff to bring them back into gameplay, as currently they probably feel a bit forgotten with all the launch pad meta.
- Don't allow DBNO players to be virtually impossible to eliminate as you can't find them when they're in a massive water source like loot lake. I think they should lose HP 1.5x faster than just regularly being DBNO in a normal environment, as it should be seen as drowning.
- Make smoke grenades multi-coloured/rainbow rather than white, as it would add to the game's aesthetic better.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head for now. I understand this is both a F2P game and early access so of course it's not going to be perfect, but the devs are 'epic' and I'm sure you guys would agree with some of my points here.

As I mentioned above, I'd love to hear your feedback on this list and what you think should be added that's not some huge task such as new maps, weapons etc.

If you manage to get to the circle with some time remaining, For example if you have 15 seconds left next time you are in the ""Storm"" you will not lose health for another 15 seconds.

The points you get in a game per kill are calculated like this: 

`pointsForKill = (startPlayers - currentlyAlivePlayers) * ((1 + currentKills) / 2);`

This rewards you for killing players troughout the game, because every kill that you do makes further ones much more valueable, especially the final one. Then take the 10 games with the highest total points in a match in a certain month  - bam, your leaderboard score for that month. So far, it seems very good at representing actual skill - and *not just your hiding skill*. With my system, placement is not calculated in, but i guess it could be modified to make it worth a minority part, i however was not interested to have that be a thing.

A long time ago when MLG wasnt a meme there was a game called Halo: Reach, now when it came about the competitive scene had a major issue with the game, the grand designers of the previous games in the series added a shitty mechanic called Bloom which caused such a outrage the developers decided to add No Bloom playlists so the competitive scene could enjoy the game still and those who played social could enjoy the game with or without Bloom being a factor. 

So I suggest Epic follow the trend, give us No Bloom servers so we can have more competitive games and not have to bitch on reddit about how trash Bloom is and have this age old argument between anti-Bloomers and FN Fanboys and we can all enjoy FortNite together. This would be efficient as well because all they would need to do is disable Bloom on some servers and put in a filter for Bloom or No Bloom similar to the Fill or No Fill filter.

So I got to thinking, could there ever be a way to create a ""private"" server for wagers in Fortnite? It would be amazing to have 100 people throw in $1 for a $100 prize pool each match.

* Early fights especially, shields essentially give you a bail, extra reaction time, extra chance to turn the fight around if you were caught. 2 guys looting nearby houses will have their fight outcome decided by having that extra health more often than not. Even more so because early fights are often just shotgun and smg scrapes, where ammo and damage are limited.

* Same mid and lategame, aside from being headshotted by sniper shields will almost always give you a chance to retaliate against ambushes (especially relevant for Solo) or escape.

* Agressive players are punished by this severely. Unlike PUBG, where killing 10 people will allow me to scavenge enough boosts to heal over 75 and improve my armor and gear on top of that, in Fortnite fighting is actually a detriment (assuming you start with 100Shields), you will just moderately upgrade your weapons, and will generally not have any chances to replenish the lost shields, as both potions and slurps are **still too rare**(slurps especially feel rarer than golden RPG), and nobody carries them for future use anyway because of limited space. You often won't even be able to heal to 100. And then at the last zone you will encounter a guy who sat in a bush for the *whole game*, evading fights and has full hp/shields and you cannot out-DPS him.

This is all tied up with the HP and HP replenishment honestly, and there is already a good [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7fu9l7/heres_why_the_75_health_works_in_pubg_and_to_an/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) about it on the front page. Like it or not, PUBG currently does a much better job at giving *all* players ability to cap out health and rewarding agressive players.

There were multiple suggestions, ""lifesteal"" type passive shield gain upon kills, people dropping  slurps on death even if they didn't have them, major overhaul of health and shields in general. It's something to consider for Epic. But one thing for certain, current shields are too RNG, too advantageous in all stages of a game, promote camping and hiding and punish proactive players.",FortNiteBR

Normally i'm not a hider, i'm more of a run n gun chad, usually racking in at least 10 kills a game if I can get out of spawn town. Ever since the bush was released I was never really interested in using it, just not my play style.

First i'll give a little background on the game.

I decided that if I come across the bush though in a good enough situation (top 20, bread n butter inventory, meds) I would give it a shot for shits and giggles.

The game finally happened, I came across a house with the bush with 15 people left in game, had my snipe, shotgun, scar, and 8 kills, I was ready.

I head for the center, plop down, and watch the action unfold. Any chance I can I take random snipes at people in their bases (never killed anyone, but bodied a few). The moment comes, i'm lucky enough that the circle centers on me, and theres 4 left (including me).

A guy comes up (obviously most skilled of this group) and starts making a base without noticing me. Another dude tries to enter the circle and the base builder pops his head out to scar the dude down. I knew that was my moment, sniped the base guy in the head as he was gunning, turned and killed the other dude with my scar before he noticed wtf was going on.

The last guy was late to the circle and had no idea what happened, ended up straight up running right past me so I shotgun him for the win.



**HERES WHERE I GET TO MY POINT:**

I notice the skilled base guy was a streamer, so I hit him up to say gg's. Now I won't name who the streamer was, but never in my life have I received so much hate. People in his chat immediately jumped at my throat saying I have no skill and no hope at ever getting better in the game. I am cancer, aids, etc etc.

Even the streamer was saying he couldn't believe I would ""waste my life"" playing that way and that I am a terrible player.

Obviously hes not someone I would watch on a normal basis, but are people really this salty about the bush? I have news for you: its fair game, thats why its in the game.

Just because someone is using it doesn't mean they don't have any skill, like get off your high horse.


**EDIT:** Please don't ask for the streamers name, I am not willing to break reddit etiquette to disclose that information. I realize that you might not want to watch someone like that, but I don't want to be responsible for anything actually bad that would happen to the guy for trying to incite some sort of riot.",FortNiteBR

I am not a game developer and don't know much about networks to suggest if it is possible to make this change in the game. But if it really is possible, the game would be so much better for people like me who live in developing countries with 100+ ping.

For a game that relies so much on quick reactions, the slight delay between your character switching weapons and actually pressing the key feels like an eternity and has a huge impact on how fast you can play the game. It is very hard for me to immediately build cover after getting hit by the first bullet because I have to wait 0.5 seconds (which is a very long time in gaming) for character to switch to the building screen, and by that time I am already dead.

Other things include not being able to switch to assault rifle in time after making one sniper shot, and not being able to use two pump shotguns alternatively for a faster fire rate.

The only reason I am making this complaint is because I generally play competitive FPS's and although ping is always an issue, switching weapons is generally client sided in every game so I have never felt it to affect my speed. I know fortnite isn't meant to be a competitive game but not being able to match your reactions with the game speed really bothers me.

If it is not possible to fix this due to the way the game is coded then I guess ignore this thread. But if it can, I hope it is a priority! Thanks for listening.",FortNiteBR

However, I'm still sick of games that end far to early because of this. 

So the issue I have can be split into two categories. First: dying to storm damage on the first or second rotation
Second: running an actual marathon just to get the end game with little to no gear whatsoever. 

So let me paint you a word picture here, the bus comes in a NW approach from prison to pleasant, naturally I land prison as it's my favorite spot. Me and my duo partner have 3 other teams contesting us and we end up spending a few minutes taking them out and a few more minutes looting. We look to see where the circle is and wouldn't ya know it, first circle is around loot lake. We move NW towards loot lake and one of two things happen. Either A we run into literally any other teams and spend time fighting them thus probably dying to the storm or we run into no one but have absolutely no time to loot on the way and end up at the circle with sub par gear. The next circle rotation hits and where is it this time? The NW half of pleasant park. Rinse repeat.

The issue here is that you cant have a game centered around pvp that mercilessly punishes you for engaging in pvp. Why the circle can extend to the very edges of the map in the first place is beyond me but when im playing duo and we drop pleasant with 6 other teams just to see the circle at the bottom right off the map we literally have to choose between taking our time clearing the town, rushing and hoping for the best, or looting enough to sustain us as we run from town while others continue to loot so we don't die to the storm. 

I think a very simple solution would be to just increase the timer before the storm moves in by like 45 seconds to a minute. Not a huge change but for the people who spawn on the literal farthest point from the circle it would make a world of difference. 

Interested in what everyone else thinks.

A recent post had me thinking about this issue again. Someone asked me why fortnite added that bandages dont heal above 75. My answer was that its copied from PUBG (and others). 

It got me thinking why it works in PUBG but does not really work in Fortnite. Here's my opinion:

---

The current breakdown of healing items



**PUBG heal items**


* **Bandage**: 10hp over time, cast time 4 seconds. Cant go above 75hp. **rarity**:  (very) common

* **Energy Drink**: Gives a boost that heals above 75hp over time, cast time 4 seconds. **rarity**: common 

* **Pain Killer**: Gives a boost that heals above 75hp over time, cast time 6 seconds.  **rarity**: uncommon

* **First Aid Kit**: Heals to 75hp, cast time 6 seconds.  **rarity**: uncommon

* **Med Kit**: Heals to 100hp, cast time 8 seconds.  **rarity**: rare

* **Adrenaline Syringe**: Gives a boost that heals above 75hp over time, cast time 8 seconds.  **rarity**: rare



**Fortnite heal items**

* **Bandage**: 15hp, cast time 5 seconds. Cant go above 75hp. **rarity**:  (very) common

* **Med Kit**: Heals to 100hp, cast time 10 seconds.  **rarity**: uncommon/rare

* **Slurp Juice**: Heals 25hp and 25 shield. Can heal above 75hp, cast time 2 seconds. **rarity**: rare

---


Here lies the real problem. For this system to work PUBG has 4 items that can heal above 75hp. Two of those are very common. Almost everyone has a few on them in the end game. Almost every dead guy you loot has them for the take. In PUBG it's very easy to get above 75hp and the **Painkillers and Energy Drinks are often taken pre fight** to have the regen (and movement speed but thats a different system we wont talk about now) during the fight.

This is completely different in Fortnite. Where Slurp juice is a rare item you kinda want to use immediately because of inventory space. But it is best used at 75hp to get the full benefit. So you usually end up healing up with bandage, dropping them for the slurp juice and then picking the bandages back up. Cumbersome right?

I think Med Kits are in a good place right now. They are uncommon/rare but in the endgame you are bound to find some on dead bodies.

---

**My suggestion**

Change slurp juice to uncommon. Have it drop from chests more often as an extra item like bandages. Make it an item that gives 25hp (so no more shield. Only as overheal or when at full health) over time no matter what. So when you are at 50hp you get to 75hp. When you are at 75hp you get to 100hp. When you are at 90hp you get to 100hp + 15 shield, etc.. **But you cant go above 50 shield** This is where you would use a normal shield potion to top you off. This might possibly also adress some problems people have with shields.

---

These are just my 2 cents. Let me know what you guys think.

Remember: discussions are healthy and downvoting is way too easy.

---

**Edit**: 

Some people still like the idea that dead players drop some health/shield. I wrote a bit about that a week ago. 


https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7dcj9e/lets_talk_about_shields_again


Still think it would be a nice idea. Maybe 20hp flask when you kill someone with 50-100 shield and 10hp flask when 0-50 shield. 

The flask can be used to top off health and as shield to a max of 50.

Combine this with /u/TheElectrikCow idea to make 4 dedicated weapon slots and 2 consumable slots thus increasing total to 6 in stead of 5. This would make inventory management a bit better too.

I wish there was something to work towards.  I absolutely love the game and have been a top player for some time but have been burnt out for a while.  

I realize that none of this might be new but here are my suggestions:

Challenges: Add a ton of different challenges ranging in difficulty with rewards being Xp, badges, and for the completionist challenge maybe an umbrella skin of some sort.  Much like CoD, you master a certain set of guns you unlock a camo or a calling card.

Ranks:  While some players get off just by roaming around and playing the game, there are those of us that would love something telling us we‚Äôre the best.   There are PLENTY of examples of ranking systems in other similar games.

Leaderboards: Actual global leaderboards. I can‚Äôt grasp why you would be against a leaderboard.  Something with Kill, Deaths, K/D, average kills per game, average damage per game, revives, downs, anything along those lines.  The only explanation I can see as to why this isn‚Äôt already in the game is maybe the game couldn‚Äôt handle it.  If that‚Äôs the case then I‚Äôm 100% alright with the devs waiting to release it.

What a mistake that was.  Just some of the things I didn't like in case anyone was thinking of trying it out...

-The game was horribly optimized.  I have a fairly powerful PC and it ran like shit with constant stuttering even at lower settings.

-Map is way too big.  Unless you get a car, you spent the entire game running through empty fields, which is way more painful in this game than in Fortnite.  And since cars make you an obvious target, it's really a lose/lose.

-Takes forever to drop into the map, parachute is annoying to control

-The controls feel incredibly clunky and slow

-With the map being so big you usually don't even see another person till the end of the game.

-If you get shot at first you have zero chance of defending yourself.  Made me really miss building.

-Item/inventory system is overly complex.  Way too many components and different types of ammo for weapons.  Frustrating to manage. 

Just amazes me how a $30 game can have so many issues with Fortnite is free and just runs so much better. 

I'll be getting this game refunded today.

Here are some ideas we came up with to improve the map:

1. A northern snowy area. The northwestern section of the map above Pleasant Park could totally work as a snowy area, maybe with more mountains there (think the Hebra region from Breath of the Wild)

2. A beach/shoreline location. On the south side of the map, stretching from below the named farm location (not sure if it‚Äôs Anarchy Acres or Fatal Fields, Oops) to the edge of moisty mire. We could see some beach cabins here, maybe som resort buildings too.

3. A proper ‚Äòcity‚Äô. I‚Äôm not sure where this could fit into the map but maybe a small city with ‚Äòskyscrapers‚Äô could be cool.

4. Floating islands. In the southwestern side of the map, below Greasy Grove and next to Flush Factory, theres a lot of unused open space compared to the rest of the map. I think a bunch of floating islands with connecting bridges could be cool. Maybe some bridges could be destructible?

5. More distinction between the farms. At the moment Anarchy Acres and Fatal Fields feel very similar. Perhaps, one could be a traditional farm like the current design for both, and the other could be more of an industrialized farm.

6. Railroads. I‚Äôd like to see a railroad stretching through the map. Tunnels could go through mountains with railways, splitting tracks, maybe even a moving train.

7. Caves. An interconnecting cave system underneath the entire map could be cool if done right. High risk because tight spaces and it might be easy to die but easy transportation?

8. Small improvements. Maybe another river or two, or some more ponds and small lakes. More variants of houses and cabins.

Feel free to critique or throw around some other ideas. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on these!",FortNiteBR

For solo, I think it if you place:  
26th to 100th place - 8 Bucks  
7th to 25th place - 16 Bucks  
2nd to 6th place - 32 Bucks  
1st - 150 Bucks


For duos, your technical odds of winning go up from 1/100 to 2/100 so I think it should scale down to half as many coins to compensate fairly. If your team places:

13th to 50th place - 4 Bucks  
4th to 12th place - 8 Bucks  
2nd to 3rd place - 16 Bucks  
1st - 100 Bucks (Winning is still really hard and no one would play duos because of lack of incentive so I think the 1st place shouldn‚Äôt scale like normal)


And for squads, your technical odds of winning go up from 2/100 to 4/100 so I think it should scale down to a fourth as many coins compared to solo. If your team places:

13th to 50th place - 2 Bucks  
4th to 12th place - 4 Bucks  
2nd to 3rd place - 8 Bucks  
1st - 75 Bucks (Winning is still really hard and no one would play squads because of lack of incentive so I think the 1st place shouldn‚Äôt scale like normal)


I was thinking that you could possibly be rewarded 0.25 or 0.5 coins for every kill to reward a more aggressive and risky playstyle, but the object of the game isn‚Äôt necessarily to be Rambo so I don‚Äôt really know



As someone who spent money on the spookyboi skin, I think this is pretty fair. What do you guys think? ",FortNiteBR

First off what you need to know what fortnite does that CS:GO does not is that (UE4)Fornite scale on what's called Vert FoV. Meaning the lower the asepct ratio of your screen, the more vertical space you see. So say you have a 21:9 screen, and your friend has a 5:4 screen, your friend will see practically double your 21:9screen in vertical space.

If you'd like to see just how much of a difference a higher aspect ratio can really be seen here's a comparison of a 21:9 screen versus a 5:4 screen: https://imgur.com/a/xzaip (This also shows 21:9 vs 16:9 vs 16:10)


What does this mean? Well if you play in 5:4 mode you see the same horizontal space as 16:9, but you see more vertical space. And since Fortnite is a 3rd person game, you can use the extra vertical space to peak over walls and hills and see people where they cannot see you, and you have a lower risk of being exposed.

Ontop of this, you can also Use Stretched mode in Fortnite as well. You can do this by setting your monitor and graphics card to a Stretch mode, and then setting your windows Base resolution to 1280x1024, or any avalible 5:4/4:3 aspect ratio. Then run Fortnite in Windowed Fullscreen.

Stretched mode makes targets overall larger and easier to aim at, especially when trying to go for headshots.

In CS:GO, the game does not operate on Vert FoV, it operates on HFoV. Meaning that in Fortnite not only can you apply the Stretched viewport advantage, you also get vertical view peak advantage.

There is really only one downside to this, your weapons Hotbar will overlap your hp and shield bar, but the Numbers on the HP/shield are Aligned to the left so it's really not a problem.

If you have a 144hz/240hz 16:9 Display, this FoV setup will give you the highest aiming and awareness advantage possible in FortniteBR.

Just to be aware, this is not cheating. It requires no external software or interactions with the game. It is simply using hardware the way it was designed to work. The game does this viewport expansion by default. It is very simply the way Fortnite's HFoV lock operates.

EPIC could very simply fix this by swapping the HFoV Lock for a VFoV lock.

TL;DR

Run windows and monitor in a stretched 5:4 mode. Run FBR in Windowed Mode. Enjoy wider targets and better wall and hill peaking.",FortNiteBR

In the last 5 days I haven't had a single game where I didn't win or finish in the top 10. I have a 61% winrate, 100% top 10 rate, and 73% top 3 rate. 

A lot of this is due to the fact the people I'm playing against generally just aren't that skilled. If I die it's usually to a mistake on my part less so a good play on my opponents part. 

I'd love to start seeing more games where I can noticeably see that the people I am playing are good at the game, or at the least around my skill level. 

See in CS:GO for example, I only play other Global Elite players, sometimes Supreme if it's early morning, but at the least the people I play are good at the game. There is a challenge. In Fortnite it's like shooting minnows in a water glass. 

Watch any streamer's first 3 minutes of game play and you will see what I mean, people just feeding free kills aimlessly running around. I'd like to think there's enough people to have a skill based MM system by now, but maybe I am wrong. 

Either or, when I win 2-3 in a row I just get bored and go do something else. The game doesn't challenge me in its current state.

With this being the case, it gives passive players a huge advantage over agressive players, due to them having more shields from less fighting.

Someone suggested an armor system of sorts to help this. There would be different rarities of armor, and instead of disappearing like a shield, you put them on. That way if you kill someone, you have a chance of upgrading your loot.

I think it would add a little element of player to player connection for ending your encounters.

Some example emotes:

Obviously the slow clap (salty)

Fancy salute (gg)

Finger wagging (for those camper killers)

Checks underwear (for ambush kills)

Call me gesture (if you want the person to play with you later/friend request)

Robert deniro ""I'm watching you"" (to let them know you're sticking around to see how they do)

There could be lots of fun ones to design.

What I mean is when you click the joystick down to sprint, it shouldn't cancel if you click it again. If we want to cancel the sprint, we can just stop moving forward for a split second. 

Why is this a problem? Sometimes (very often for me) I'm not sure if I'm sprinting or not, especially when I'm in a hectic fight and need to run to get better positioning. 

If you notice, your player takes 2-3 steps before he actually starts sprinting and that can throw you off because you're not sure if he's running or walking and then click the sprint again. Sometimes you would be sprinting, but because of the 2-3 normal steps before running, it makes you think that you're not sprinting, so you hit the sprint again and end up cancelling the sprint. 

How to fix it: make the sprint button JUST a sprint button. Make it NOT cancel sprint. That way we can spam it and make sure we are sprinting, if needed. If we need to stop sprinting, we can just stop moving for a split second.

I think fortnite is ok a really good state besides the no regs on snipers and the severe lag spikes that happens every so often. 

Edit: The bottom line is, if they take out the facets that allow player to become better, learn and adapt to the game to become better and more proficient players.

Well most people will (might) know that you can still play cross platform.  Playing on PS4? add your PC buddy on the Epic launcher and you can join each other's lobbies.  You play on PC server in this case, btw.


Do we know if this is intended?  I'm curious because I play with some PC buddies, and am wondering if this will go away.  Not seen an official response for months now.

If you have, please fill me in!

Since the last update, for some reason the Asian server is full of AimBOTers. They tag solo on squad and just run around murdering the whole map.

We report them every time but there are always more and more. They're making the game very toxic as there is nothing we can do about it. Does anybody know if Epic changed something with their banhammer? Is it the same on your servers?

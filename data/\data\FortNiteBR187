But what the fuck. Every single fight I get into on solo I have to fight like my life depends on it. I genuinely had to google to see if they had introduced skill-based match-making.

When I do get killed, there's a very good chance it's a ""streamer"", more so than it used to be.

A mate I play with did suggest that a lot of the players that struggled with this game migrated to CoD. This might be true, as two friends I played with uninstalled Fortnite the day CoD was released, and coincidentally they were the two worst.",FortNiteBR

The fact that in this game you can have double the health from someone, shoot them 7 times, 4 of those in the head, he still isn't dead, and he will just shoot you once and kill you is utterly ridiculous.

 BUT

I don't think any of us are enjoying it. We like the skins and fun modes and doing the challenges, but we all seem to be pinched against the phenomenal skill of EVERY GODDAMN BODY.

When the fuck did gaming become so fucking competetive? I mean, I get trying to win, but even the little kiddies are destroying me the moment I land. They are able to complete series of actions before I can even move my reticle to them. It's really ruining the experience for me. 

Is it just me or am I alone in having a problem with only having these 2 options: ""Get Good"" or keep dying and wait in menus to try and respawn to only do that over and over again?

I know this may sound pretty or whatever, but it's just so hard to explain... something is wrong with this. I can't foresee giving up gaming online or just moving on to something else...

I also dont think its fair to feel obligated to 5 hours of intense practice a day to stay up to speed. I've gamed my whole life. I'm 36 and have had a PS controller in my hand since them little yellow cheat balls in NASCAR LOL.

I am not bad, I actually think I'm pretty decent. This new culture of top teir levels I think are alienating me though. They make me feel like trash.

Does anyone know what I'm trying to say or vent here? Am I alone here?",FortNiteBR

Invisible players.  Supposedly fixed.  Guess not.

Inexplicable deaths.  Had clear kill on a guy.  Undeniable.  Everyone in squad spectating.  Cucked by servers.  Lost.  I have the recording.

I know xbox fortnite has been shit for months now but Ive never had all three of these broken in the same game.  Its usually a rotation of these bugs.  Can we go back to that?  Id rather have one instead of all three.

(pun intended) I really like Fortnite. I really do. Especially with the new skins coming out, and the new Quadcrusher. But I wondered ""What is the point of Fortnite?"" Of course, dear reader, you would say ""To become a better player on whatever platform you play on.""  And of course, you are right. But V-Bucks is what this post is mainly about. You need to either buy V-Bucks or have them gifted to you. Courtesy of the new creator supporting feature. I think that either buying V-Bucks or having them gifted is... uhh... I don't really have an opinon on it... acually I do. I think that that isn't that good of a feature. I think that every time you get a Victory Royale, you should get 500 V-Bucks. This way it motivates players to get VRs, and the V-Bucks are a little reward for getting those ""dubs"" as Lachlan says.

Anyways, that's just my opinion. If you agree, please like this post. If you disagree, again, this is just an opinion that I have about Fortnite.

I play almost strictly with fill on, but it's extremely frustrating for me. If my team's getting shot at, I'll often rush the annoying guy trying to pick us off and get the knockdown. It really pisses me off because then the rest of their squad comes and I have to kill 3 others that could each have up to 200 health. That's getting 6 headshots with a pump if you're lucky, on people that are bunny hopping. In a third person shooter. With a controller. (Probably easier with a mouse) My matches usually start off with looting, then we get shot at, I rush the guy shooting while my teammates are being useless potatoes and then they don't even care when I get fucking downed trying to save them from getting killed in the first place. Before you say that it's my fault for rushing, if I decide to laze off and sit in a one by one and peek with an AR then we get fucking rushed and they can never aim or build so we get demolished almost immediately. Everyone talks about how everyone's getting better at this game, but Squad Fill teammates are fucking Neanderthals when it comes to change. I only found about 4 actually good Squad Fill players after almost 2,000 matches. But I don't like talking to people, so I obviously still play on fill. I hate that it takes my teammates a good 5-10 minutes to actually fucking try to help me take down 4 fucking players, and 70% of the time we're only about 10 seconds away from each other! I'm honestly curious as to what they're doing while I'm trying to kill 3 people that are fucking bunny hopping with tactical shotguns. It really gets on my nerves when I have to kill 3 of them and the last one takes me down when I have no health or shield and thinks they're Ninja's son, so automatically thirsts me for their most likely first kill and last kill that'll go on their record. Also, another problem is that there's always that one guy that I never understand that lands somewhere by themself, gets killed almost on impact, and leaves us in a disadvantage when it's squad v squad endgame. No, you're not going to win if you land at Tilted by yourself against squads every single goddamn game you play. The only good thing about Fill that I experienced is that you get better at the game. A lot better, because you basically have to carry your squad to get a win. I played solo for the first time this month yesterday, and each time I played, I always made it to end game (playing aggressively), and won the majority of my 1v1 gunfights. I most likely could win more if I knew how to peek correctly with a sniper, but that's off topic. In a summary, Squad Fill is extremely frustrating, but you can learn a lot from it. Especially about how annoying 8 year olds can be if you don't mute in game chat.",FortNiteBR

Think about the amount of John wicks you saw in season three (literally 50% of players) compared to the amount of ragnaroks. I feel that this season’s challenges are stupidly hard (e.g ringing doorbells) and some challenges that previously granted you 5 stars are now part of a long chain continuous challenges (e.g last season there was “sniper damage” worth 5 stars, but this season you have to do hunting rifle, then bolt, then heavy) which just makes it way more tedious. Some of the challenges aren’t even fun and just draw out boring, slow games shooting targets or something. Why is epic doing this to us?

These instant meta changes are often problematic, because players must adapt in order to dominate other players. If you are good at the game, you can adapt quickly, but if you aren't, you need to spend hours of your time practicing to obtain a grasp on the meta. Now lets talk Fortnite in specific. The current meta as of a few weeks into season 6, is all about the smg. I have waited a long time to post on this issue, so the smg meta or ""spray meta,"" isn't quite as bad as it used to be but it is still irritating for players like myself who have been playing since the early days of the game, and have experienced all of the other metas. Epic Games has worked to remedy the overpoweredness of the SMG but have not quite succeeded. I have a few suggestions as to what Epic could do to fix this issue, because I really hope to make an impact on the state of this game which I love so much.

\* \*\*Disable Shotgun Switch Timers-\*\* This method of fixing the meta is my number 1 ideal fix. Currently, there is a timer displayed when you switch between shotguns, making old shotgun strategies obsolete. You can no longer double up on your shotguns, which honestly is probably the number one thing that is being requested of Epic Games all over the internet. I think that if Epic were to disable the timer, and bring back double pump and the pump-tac strategies, the effectiveness of smgs might be cancelled out a little bit. I think that if double shotgun becomes a viable strategy again, smgs might not be the meta of the game forever.

\* \*\*Buff Shotgun Damage-\*\* This is another fix involving shotguns. Another one of Epic Game's most unpopular nerfs was the nerf to the pump shotgun and the tactical with reduced damage multipliers on both weapons. Another way to partially cancel out the effectiveness of Smgs could be to bring back the damage on the shotgun. I know and fully understand that epic was trying to make the shotguns not as overpowered as before, but instead they made using shotguns into more of a gamble than it should be. I cannot count how many times I have experienced a 7 or an 8 damage shot on a shotgun. I think that shotguns should dominate the close range again, and smgs should be more of a choice weapon than a literal necessity at this point. This solution is a little more risky, but it would be interesting to see Epic do a shooting test #2, much like they did for the first time they nerfed shotgun damage.

\* \*\*Buff Structure Health-\*\* Did anyone else notice that around the exact same time as smgs began to become dominant, the health of structures was nerfed? One of the most infuriating things in this game to die by is someone just spraying their P90 into your 1x1 while you are trying to regain high ground in a build fight. I think that if health of structures would be restored to their former glory, ""spraying and praying"" wouldn't be as viable a strategy for players.

I think that any one of these changes could potentially fix Fortnite. My hope for this post is for it to make its way up to an Epic games developer. I have spent a lot of time on this, and even if this doesn't get implemented into the game, I hope to start a serious discussion on the future of the Fortnite meta.",FortNiteBR

Child accounts cannot play the tournaments, nor can they access epic friends lists, due to it being a child account. The microsoft rep said they would get their engineers on the job to figure something out, but this comes down to an epic problem and their coding of the game/accounts system.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic can we please get a response if you are going to change the epic games friends on xbox child accounts, he cannot play with his friends on any platforms and we cant have any fun otgether. I dont get why being a child account has this restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

Season 1-3 , I was able to win a handful of solos and never felt overwhelmed.  I haven't been playing as much because each skirmish turns into a crazy build off that is really fun to watch but I just can't keep up. 

Solution:. LTM Builder Stamina

A bar that allows you to build enough for stairs, a small base, maybe a total of 8-10 pieces and then sends building into a cooldown. Similar to how sprinting was treated in STW.  

I think this would keep fights from turning into massive build offs and still keep the core mechanics of fortnite intact, before everyone became master builders. ",FortNiteBR

After 3 months of hard work we made it, and it is available for you right here : [www.buildfight.com](https://www.buildfight.com) 

Feel free to give any constructive feedbacks, a lot of new features are coming really soon !

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions/complains please refer to [/u/mel-akio](https://www.reddit.com/user/mel-akio)

BUT the devs saw this problem and they fixed it on season 5 or 4 update when i saw the patch note i was really excited to play fortnite again.. Fortnite season 5 was the most stable version imo then fortnite season 6 started, The game feels great, amazing and addicted to play like season 2 or 1 but there are really annoying bugs

Heavy sniper sometimes after editing

Can't sprint sometimes while building

Players phasing through building AGAIN i died too many due this bug...

STICKERS!,"I was looking thru my Fortnite Inventory, just seeing all my old battlepass and past season rewards, and seeing how MANY of the throwable emoticons I have, and thinking about how little I've used them, and how even I've seen even less other people using them.  


So I thought to myself, of a way to make these emoticons stay in the game as emoticons, but also have a more visible and usable purpose: Stickers!  


The emoticons would work as Stickers do in CS:GO and other games, you could take them and maybe apply them to either 'any' or a 'blank' glider, or to a pickaxe, or the default fortnite weapons so that they get the stickers applied to them while you pick them up and as long you use them! I'd say maybe on characters or backpacks, but that'd be too much - I think just pickaxes, weapons, and gliders would just do!  


We'd have sort of a gun preview, where we can see the default guns, or any selected/or blank template glider/pickaxe, and then work from there positioning the stickers ourselves, maybe limitless, or maybe with a cap of 1 sticker, or 2, 5, 10, etc, depending on how Epic Games wants to handle it.  


They'd just be silly, and would work on however each person would like them! You'd be able to use any emoticon from past seasons/events/battle passes!

But most of all, aim assist is absolute bullshit. Not only do console players seem to not have any bloom with an AR or SMG, but they consistently hit ""headshots"". 

I'm getting sick and fucking tired of being pumped or tac'd for max damage by some bot with a .6kd, who then proceeds to SMG/Explosive spam me while trying to pop minis. 

Of the past 10 people that have killed me over the last 2 nights, 8 of which have been from either PS4 or Xbox1. 

A few of them were good, decent builders, but hit these absurd off angle headshots and then laser me. 

I'm all for people playing with their friends, and cross platform allows that, which is really cool, I for one don't play with anyone on console because I've been a PC gamer for 15 years. 

I'm not the only one to bitch about this, or feel that the games performance has taken a nose dive since cross platform has become a thing. 

If you're a console player and don't use aim assist, kudos. Aiming with your thumbs is difficult, I get it. But if you're going to play against PC players, then play like a PC player. 

I know this will get downvoted into the ground, but it needed to be said. Stop crutching and play the right fucking way. Or save some money and buy a PC. ",FortNiteBR

1. There isn't much variation between them to make them stand out. It kinda feels like I'm doing a few boring (or annoying) tasks and few which involve killing players (which we should already be doing).
2. It makes it too easy to move up through the tiers. I get it that you would like to unlock everything in the battle pass but you do get 2 costumes straight away which already has the value of buying costumes though the store. And if you couldn't unlock everything then why you buy it only to complain because you didn't have time? (It's your duty to know whether or not you have the time to do it). It also makes it so that everyone has the exclusive items, which isn't that exclusive.
3. They get in the way of playing the game correctly. You know what I mean when you see 20 people trying to land on top of a clocktower just to dance on it.

(I get excited and press entirely too hard) Then I have to click it 3 more times to get them rotated correctly. In the middle of a fight, you can understand how much of a disadvantage that is. On top of that, there are certain builds that are completely useless for PS4 players, such as using the stairs to descend, because of the amount of time it takes to rotate them. I feel like there are numerous tactical builds that aren’t even options for me, but I watch PC players use them effortlessly. It feels like I’m missing out on part of the fun.

Then in season 4 tilted was about to be destroyed because of the rocket and what omega programed it do. Then in season 5 the runes look like the location  of tilted on the map and in season 6 it will be destroyed so it would be kinda cool if the whole multi season story line was a massive build up to destroy the city like the plot in most stories and maybe since Omega told the rocket to destroy tilted the cube aka the thing that was created by the rocket this whole time has been trying to destroy tilted but placing the runes has been the top priority because maybe the rift trapped the visitor in the sky and the runes are the only way for him to return so when all the cubes activate the ""perma rift"" appears it will allow the visitor to come through and get home then the cube will go and destroy tilted now that its prime directive has finished. Then it will complete its secondary directive programed by omega so that's why it went out of its way to destroy the building﻿ since it could complete both tasks effectively.

So the story line in my opinion is:

Something happens and the Visitor is in the meteor headed towards the fortnite island for some reason. Just say that the controller vibrating is just a hint from epic. Then the meteor crashes. Visitor wanting to go home finds out the Omega wanting to destroy the city with a rocket is gathering the material from the crystals to build said rocket. Vistor realizes that he could hijack the rocket and use it to head home when he does this he adds another program to teleport him home using the crystals and make it priority he didn't delete the omegas old program because he did not want to be caught. Not fully understanding the crystals or it just blew up and that was what omega's rocket was going to do it created the rift trapping the visitor inside, all while bending the fabric of space-time. He figured a way out by creating the cube out of pure hop rocks which was going to create runes to re-open the rift. (also a reason the runes had an anti-gravity field because the cube was made of hop rocks.) This closed the rift, but will help it open fully when the runes activate. Since the rocket was programmed to to destroy tilted but only doing that secondary the cube creates the rift and goes to tilted because it also wants to destroy tilted, but it only destroys one building because its the fasted way to loot lake. My guess because it was one of the main points where the space-time continuum was out of wack so it could help manipulate the rift same with all the other runes. So when the cube turned into the island it went to go activate all the runes since this task is now complete soon the vistor and my guess the rocket will come out of a crack that is the perma rift and it will create a new point of interest. Then once the rocket comes out the island will float to tilted and destroy it with lightning therefore completing the program from omega and then deactivating falling into tilted (or whats left) making a new named location which season 4 and season 5 both had but season 6 only had 1, leaky lake, making a new Ruins type location, All while ending what i like to call, The Meteor Saga.",FortNiteBR

I get that there are kinks to be worked out and EPIC is a fantastic developer. However, there’s no real chance here for most players and the bugs are atrocious. I am a relatively decent player and when I get a victory I usually end up with ~12 eliminations (Xbox one).

2.) Point system. Points need to be easier to get. My brother won his first game and only got 3 points. I’ve just spam hot-dropped and have 7 but in order to get those I’ve had to sweat like never before. Make points easier to get but maybe increase the number to 30 or 40

I think 50v50 needs to come back, and come back fast. There are so many reasons why and I'll do my best to explain my reasoning and thoughts behind it.

First off, 50v50 is one of the best game modes for more casual Fortnite players. Not everyone has the time or ability to get to that level of play where they feel comfortable in Squads/Duos/Solos.  To all the elitist buggers about to say they need to learn to play Fortnite ""properly"" or go away, why do you not want other people to enjoy the game? Why is it a bad thing that less skilled folk can enjoy the game in a more casual mode? Isn't it a good thing that more people play it and thus making EPIC a lot more money? On that ""learn to play properly"" thing, 50v50 is a GREAT learning enviroment. Everything I've learned so far in 50v50 has helped me adjust and feel brave enough to try the other modes. I've got a friend with some mental health issues and 50v50 was casual enough that he was genuinely having fun playing Fortnite. He is absolutely devastated losing the mode. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, not everyone plays Fortnite for the skill or epic kills. Myself and a few others I know play it because we love the visual aesthetic and unique mechanics of Fortnite. So many games these days are brown, grey, uber realistic stuff and that has its place but something visually colorful and cartoony is very refreshing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, the whole ""50v50 doesn't fit the battle royale style. if you want that go play Battlefield or something"" mentality. Once again the unique mechanics and visual style of Fortnite are very appealing to some folk. This part of my discussion is purely my view so bear with me. I loved 50v50 cause it felt like a true on war when you hit the circle. Forts going up left and right, gunfire all over the place, explosions and rockets flying to and fro, downed teammates crawling to safety, and the huge pushes that eventually happened. It was a chaotic and frantic mess that I don't think Battlefield could replicate if they even tried. The one life system made it feel all the more visceral and epic when your team starts to win and you see victory over the horizon. That kind of stuff is what got me into Fortnite. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is one of the best multiplayer shooters I've played, and this is coming from someone who grew up on COD and Battlefield. 

But gunplay is definitely not the thing that makes this game great. It's the building. I think that building is the game's strongest, most defining element, and it is what keeps this game ahead of its competitors. 

The only issue, though, is that a lot of other franchises are encroaching on the Battle Royale genre. Black Ops 4 is the #1 game on Twitch right now (I know that this is only because the game just came out like a few days ago, but I'm certain that it will continue to chip away at Fortnite's player base).

&amp;#x200B;

\#So what can Epic do to keep their game thriving?

1) Remove bloom

It is no fun when most gun fights are dictated by total RNG. Thankfully, Epic has already done this with shotguns by adding a regular spread pattern. But this ""feature"" still remains on all other weapons, namely ARs/bursts. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING LASERED FROM A MILE AWAY?

This problem is easily fixed, and it doesn't require the implementation of a completely RNG-based system. The solution is recoil. Give guns a regular recoil pattern. That way, gun fights can be determined by the actual skills of the players, and their ability to control the recoil. Ideally, each gun will have different recoil patterns, so that would add even more of a skill-based element. In conjunction to recoil, we also already have damage drop off. It's the reason why a pistol can't do 52 headshots from 90m away. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SKILL GAP? 

Yeah, well... that's sort of the point. The whole fun in playing video games comes from getting better with practice. This whole idea of putting in RNG into a game simply because you can't hit your shots is stupid. Don't punish everyone else just because you refuse to get better. And a wide skill gap isn't inherently a bad thing, either. Nobody walked into Fortnite as a builder-God. We all started off as default skins who barely knew how to place a wall down under pressure. But now most of us can get into pretty intense build fights and outplay our opponents (or get our asses handed to us, but learn from it either way). But that's the whole reason why building is so fun -- it's because the skill ceiling is so high. 

Point is, bloom is no fun. Winning/losing gun fights due to something you can't control is not good game design, and this is why many players are looking to competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Building 

&amp;#x200B;

""Need cover? Build some."" 

This is what one of the most iconic loading screens says. This used to be the case, back when walls and ramps actually took damage. Now, it seems like even brick walls are made from paper mache. Epic, if you are reading this,  please consider reverting the health of structures back to pre-season 5 levels. Building should actually feel solid. Even wood walls don't need to feel like they're made out of paper. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) This one is pretty ambitious, but perhaps..... a new map?

&amp;#x200B;

We've been playing the same map for a year now. Sure, they've added a whole list of new locations, including a desert. That's great, but at its very core, it's still largely the same map. This is something that a lot of players have been wanting. We just want a new map. Something new for us to learn and explore.

And i generally do not understand all the hate towards him. Im not watching Ninja frequently, but i did watch his streams the last three days, so did i watch Tfue, Mongraal, and Symfuhny. ""Mongraal the Building God,"" ""Symfuhny the fastest editor"" or ""Tfue guy With the best Aim"" i generally understand where all those descriptions come from. However, all those People saying ""Ninja isn't good anymore, Ninja is trash"" and so on probaly don't even watch him. I did the last 3 Days, and i think he is probaly one of the best Pros currently out there, now before you stop reading and offending me, please atleast look at the Points i have.

~Overall Skill:

I think Ninja js combined one of the best Pros. While he isn't insane in building, editing, or aiming he does master all of those Skills really well. People keep forgetting that you don't need to be insane in one Point, you can also be great in all Points. Tfue lacks Building, Mongraal lacks aiming, Symfuhny makes tons of useless edits sometimes making him die. However, Ninja has the Brain. Which is probaly the Reason that he probaly has one of the best Pro stats around, obviously talking about Casual stats not Scrims. He is thinking really well about when and how to handle a Situation, so is his decision making really awesome. He is also great in Building lately, being able to do 6layer, doing quick 90s and so on. Ninja isn't insane in anything, he is Great in everything, and that's fine.

His Character:

I understand that he is kinda Childish and overreacting to many things, but that doesn't make him cringy or sad. He is doing it for the Entertainment, and to be honest i rather like watching like ninja, then Tfue. Tfue almost never reacts to anything, making his stream incredible boring to watch for me. However, if you don't like flippy Streamers that's fine, no reason to hate him imo.

His Community:

Yeah this one i can agree on, i feel like his Community is really childish (probaly because most are kids though) and annyoing. Which can make it really frustrating to talk to a Ninja fanboi. However that's not Ninjas fault and just because someone is defending him, it doesn't instantly mean it's a fanboi.

Stream Sniper Callouts:

I get that Ninja is often calling someone a Stream sniper which might not be one. But you gotta understand that he is streaming alot, and long. And if you do that everyday, it can get kinda frustrating when 3 People are landing on your House and start pickaxing you. Most times he does only callout if it's an obvious stream snipe. That there can be some random Situations where he is pissed and decides to blame the death on a stream sniper happens, so does Tfue often. I don't think this is really a reason to flame Ninja, most don't know how hard streaming can actually be, especially with such a bic Viewership.



I overall think that most are just swimming with the Pool, one is saying he sucks, others do so too. Most don't even watch his Gameplay the latest Days. I don't think he deserves so much hate at all.",FortNiteBR

basically the idea is this: a new LTM similar to the thanos LTM in which the game starts normally, but eventually one player can lay claim to a random area of the map that gets designated as poland. whoever claims the area first gets to be hitler, who like thanos is a much bigger model and has superpowers. the only difference here is that hitler doesnt have a lazer cannon, but instead a propaganda cannon that, when shot with, makes your speakers start playing a hitler speech. otherwise he is the same as thanos.

whenever hitler dies, the player who killed him becomes hitler, and so on. by the end of the game, it would probably be a 1v1 between hitler and a regular player. this regular player symbolizes america, because america won world war 2. of course, this is just a game though, so either player could win in fortnite, hitler or america.

You just have to play to your potential.  IF you are not god like this wil most likely mean playing extremely passive.  I know a lot of people will find this boring ,but for me it was a challenge.  

4 Kills in this match, you really have to pick your spots and have to get lucky with the circle,  You pretty much want to stay hidden until the last showdown.  Some things that i found are helpful for this style is porta rifts, and boogie bombs.  People are not expecting it and you can catch people off guard with the bombs.  Rifts i use to make long distance travels.   

One of the hardest things is to not engage even if it looks super easy.  I have done it a lot and well, if you dont get that 1st head shot with a sniper be prepared to get bum rushed. 

 I can not stress how do able this is,  again if you look at my stats they are not great, but i challenge you to get this win guys.  LIke i said before its not as exciting most of the time but the reward is the win, not the kills,   

Who knows maybe you will end up like me with a fortnite world record?  I won my 2nd squad no fill without taking any damage from enemies..  

If you think this sounds stupid you are entitled to your opinion please just dont put others down because they may find interest in something you dont. 



Happy kill y'all",FortNiteBR

This prompted me to evaluate the current ""main"" close combat loadouts, which are as follows:

* Shotgun ( db/pump ) + any fully automatic weapon ( typically a SMG of some sort ) : this offers great burst damage and excellent building destruction capability
* Shotgun + dual pistols
* SMG only ( typically used by some of the less skilled players, who tend to force it into a 50/50 situation during which smg's are better than any other weapon )

and to further diversify this list, I'd suggest certain adjustments be made to certain items and gameplay mechanics:

* Removal of gray and green pistols: leaving in only blue pistols, which are a 4 shot kill and much more viable to get as a first weapon
* Pistol accuracy buffs
* Complete removal of shotgun pullout delay: this is a very controversial one, as you might say that it would prompt the rise of another double shotgun meta but I disagree, as I think it would fit perfectly well in the current meta, with its current damage numbers and perhaps nerfed damage to buildings. this is because essentially every player would have the option to go with the loadout that they'd be most effective with: people who take the risk of poor building destruction potential and going for 2 fast shots, and people who are good at tracking their target with a fast stream of bullets.

my main points here are:

* pistols deserve a buff
* removal of shotgun pullout delay should be experimented with, at least in another ""Shooting Test"" like the one in season 2 as double shotgunning has its risks and wouldn't be the most powerful option anymore, but would instead be pretty balanced.   


i'd really like to hear some of you guys' arguments on why double shotgunning would whether fit in well or be too strong in this current meta. let the discussion begin",FortNiteBR

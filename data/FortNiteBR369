I was looking at the starter pack, the outfit is cool ... but 600 vbucks seems pointless ... am I missing something?

Combined with the 200 free it's not enough for a season pass and nothing worth buying (e.g a cool skin) is 600 vbucks, so it just seems like a weird waste of money. 

So, unless I'm missing something with my 1st question (the starter pack seems pointless apart from a decent outfit?) ... my second question is ...

Is it still fine to buy a season pass at this point in the season? 

I'm at level 27 and would love that John Wick skin, but I'm kinda wondering if it's too late to get the 1000 vbucks and grab the season pass to level to 100?",FortNiteBR

Some issues go as followed:

*Floating guns*- How does this even become a thing? Many players die in certain situations which discourage them to keep playing the game for as long as they might've been playing if this were never a thing. 

*Guided missile*- Why was it even added? On top of all of the lag that there is you add an unbalanced weapon to the game. It's seriously irritating. What's the point of fighting someone in an amazing build battle and having a guided come at you to finish you off from a bush camper over 200m away from you?

*Landing lag (lag in general)*- At least for consoles, it is a known fact that there's a lag spike when you first land in some areas, including Tilted Towers, which will be addressed in the next point. No it's not the players internet, it's the servers. Players teleport from one place to the other during important events such as combat, when it's most effective (unfortunately). We know your game is immensely popular but knowing that, you should devote your time into making the servers better. We have seen swifter gameplay and more crisp quality, but you could always do better.

*Tilted Towers*- Perhaps a few weeks after implementing this area into the game, every match is too predictable. Not only is there way less people than there used to be in each circle, but players actually know where people will be at what time. It's a whole distraction and it's an area that forcefully guides players in a certain direction. People always die by the river right next to it when having to go to the circle because of people waiting for you on the other side. Seriously, do something about this...

I'm sure there's plenty of cool new features coming soon, and players want Fortnite yo last as much as you guys do. So do something about these issues, please!",FortNiteBR

OR create a currency earnable through wins only.,"I know this isn't a new concept, but at the moment, getting a win is a little bit pointless, you don't get battle stars and the only real reward you get is some XP. So i was thinking; to spice things up a bit, for each win you get, you should earn 100 V-bucks.

Now i know that might seem like alot, and it is, but by having this, Epic can continue to charge 2000 V-Bucks for skins, and it is okay bc you wont have to drop at least £16 to get it. By earning V-Bucks you are keeping good players happy. If i have 200 wins, i should be able to have something to show for it, putting me on the same level as some noob who dropped £70 on 10,000 V-Bucks and bought all the skins.

If Epic didn't want to do this, they could have Royale Tickets or something like that, a currency that is ONLY earnable through wins, or surpassing actually hard challenges.

E.G:

Win a game = 10 tickets.

Surpass 10 kills in one game = 5 tickets

Kill 5 players in one named location in a round = 5 tickets

Or something along those lines, and then you have exclusive items that people can ONLY buy with this currency, then you can show that you are a good player because you have an item which costs 200 tickets or something.

Lets think about it, a skin doesn't have to be cool looking for people to want it, the reason people want skins is to show they are different from anyone else, THIS is why skull trooper is such a cool skin to see, because very few people have it, and the people that do have it were playing back in October, and are likely a god at the game. If they were to put skull trooper back in the shop, it would lose literally all meaning because noobs would buy it, and it would essentially lose its reputation. By having a system in place in which exclusive stuff can be bought by people that are good, you give those skins value, and make them desirable, yeah you might lose out on some v bucks money. But you'll be keeping the best players happy. why do you think few good players run the Raptor skin or the new Raven skin? Because they cost so much that its mostly whale kids that buy them.

People want to stand out via exclusivity, have a system in place where people can earn their exclusivity, and you will make alot of players very happy.

It would be nice if more people survived longer to have a few more opportunities for gunfights IMO. 

I understand sometimes you drop beside somebody, get a bad deal with the weapons or chest locations and that's fine, but it's pretty consistent that around 60 people are gone by the time the storm gets to the first circle.

https://imgur.com/a/JsfUJ

I'll preface this by saying I predominately watch SypherPK, then Ninja/Myth after that when he isn't on. I think Sypher has the most educational stream BY FAR. Ninja/Myth are good, but I don't really get much out of them other than what I can immediately see them doing.

Getting good at anything in life goes in 4 stages, being that you are

1.) Unconsciously bad

2.) Consciously bad

3.) Consciously good

4.) Unconsciously good

This applies to FortNite perfectly.

1.) You don't know you're bad, so you blame the game/bloom/lag/guided rockets for why you can't win. So you will never get better as long as you're at this stage. 

The cold hard truth is that no matter how ""bad"" the game is with lag/bloom, EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE SAME ISSUES. ITS NOT JUST YOU. So the field is exactly the same for everyone to start.

2.) You finally figure out that you're bad and start to figure out why. ""I can't build for shit"" ""I panic in shotguns battles and hit nothing"" ""I can't hit anything with a sniper."" 

From this stage you can finally start getting better, because you aren't just whining on Reddit about (thing that killed you) and demanding it gets removed from the game.

3.) You finally start ironing out your bad habits and fix things.

You bind your building to other keys, you look around while running through the map, you can build more complex things than ramps in a 1x1, you slow down and aim during shotgun fights, you build around yourself when healing. At this point you think about every move you're making and why, your kill count is going up, and you're getting top 5 consistently. But you can't seem to get a win.

4.) You have a handful of good habits you don't even need to think about at this point.

You build upwards in a fight without having to stop and think, meaning you get on top of your opponent while he stumbles. You shoot a rocket and automatically switch to your AR to push down his wall and get some damage. You see the storm is coming to your opponents back so you spray everything at him either forcing him to stay in the storm or run out into your bullets. 

This is where you finally bang out wins. You have accepted you are bad, figured out what you actually need to do by watching streamers/watching Syphers educational commentaries/learning from your past mistakes, sticking to your good habits and tweaking your play, then finally doing those good things unconsciously making it second nature in a fight. On the last stage, you finally got to where winning isn't based on luck. 

Hopefully this helps people figure out what step they're on and push them away from blaming the game, which I guarantee will push you above 50% of the playerbase almost instantly.

Cheers friends.

Fortnite is a FREE game. It's 2018, where most games that are this fun cost $50+. You do not have to pay ANYTHING for this game, yet it is all my students, the Internet, and seemingly ""everyone"" (pardon the hyperbole) is talking about. 

It has bugs, yes. And maybe mine aren't as bad as yours. I can play for 3 hours and the gun glitch will happen once. And maybe it's when I'm in the final 2.. guess what? I rage a bit and then two seconds later I start a new game. Often times if I experience a really laggy game all I do is restart my Xbox (total of 5 minutes) and it's fine...

You are not Ninja or Myth (I don't think). You don't get paid to play this game. This isn't your job or livelihood. This team puts out new updates and keeps things exciting. They do this because it grows the community. You ask your friend ""hey did you see the new vending machines?"" And a third party hears it and wants to give Fortnite a go. Even if the pink rabbits ears twitch around. 

I just think we are too entitled. (Including me because when I lag I get frustrated, I'm not holier than thou) but it would be nice if we kept everything in perspective. This team is doing a great job and has revolutionized battle royale games, free games, console to pc activity, etc. I have never seen a game with this much reception, popularity, and hype. 

And if the lag makes you that mad, don't buy the skin. Don't pay for the back bling. I'm pretty sure they are aware of the issues because this sub whines about it constantly. Be thankful that you can spend hours being entertained by a FREE game, even if your pickax won't come out every 1 in 75 games...",FortNiteBR

I'll start by saying,I know this has been said a lot but I still feel players don't know or understand.

I saw quite a few suggestions on this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8aeqso/the_real_struggle_of_top_10_in_solos/?utm_source=reddit-android)
That all suggest if you want top 10,then land somewhere quiet and get a couple kills a long the way...

But I firmly disagree,you *will* hit top 10 yes...But you probably won't win if another player has more combat experience.

This is why I and many others suggest landing in high populated zones,Engage in every fight you can and learn,*FORGET THE VICTORY ROYALE* and I know that will be hard for a lot of you...so think of *HOW MANY YOU ARE GOING TO GET* the experience will give you a massive edge and stop you choking in every fight you see. 

So spend the time to practise and get better,You will notice massive improvements,I promise :D

*Edit- I feel people are missing the point,I am not saying you will gain combat skills that out way building and be the best. I am providing a tactic that is better than landing somewhere quiet and choking at the end.*",FortNiteBR

That being said FIX YOUR GAME PLEASE. The servers are absolutely horrendous, and for this game (because of how big it has gotten) they simply do not suffice and need to be improved. The glitches and in-game bugs are unbearable, and it seems like every week they become worse. I am honestly worried, I don't want this game to die out before it has even began.

BUT

Why are the bugs, glitches, lag and community outcries not being answered too? It’s just getting too much for me! 

Bug example- when you change weapons/axe mode and it just has a circle in the middle of the screen and/or your selection is just floating in mid air. This has cost me multiple engagements and it’s been going on for 2 updates.

Lag - the constant lag we get on the games from landing on the floor and having a 2 second lag window, all the way to close combat lag to the point you just die cause the game freezes. 

FUCK the vending machines, fuck the OP controller rocket launching piece of shit (although it is fun), just fix the bugs, glitches and lag and make the game playable please!

Shotguns - don’t even get me started in these. The most unpredictable things I’ve ever seen. My headshots 13 damage. Opponents head shots 73926273 damage. 

This is coming from a PS4 player with over 350 wins but I just can’t play the game as much anymore. I was hoping that BIG patch you brought out would fix a lot of these known issues, but it’s like you just don’t care. In no way can you say you don’t have the tools required when your racking the money on cosmetics! Spend a little bit of that hard earned money and put back into the game for the community.

Hold tight the community! One day we will be answered too. Add any glitches and knows issues you all know in this thread and let’s discuss everything!

Consider two cases:

1. Suppose there are exactly the same 100 players each game.  In this case, since 1 player wins and the rest lose, the average win rate after n games is: 
(\sum_{i=1}^{100} games won by person i / games played by person i) / total number of players
and since number of games played by all people is n (only 100 people), then this reduces to n / 100n = 1%.

2. Suppose there are more than 100 people, and people play an unequal number of games (as in real Fortnite), then it is not true.  For a counter example, suppose there are 101 people.  Suppose the first has players 1,...,100, and player 1 wins.  suppose the second game has players 2,..,101 play, and player 101 wins.

219,Dead_tread,1523051910,8adh7p,136,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8adh7p/the_sad_truth_of_epic/,237,The sad truth of Epic,"Tldr: epic is a company that is about to waste the potential of a great idea, because they have put their funds into monetization over optimization. The people pumping out content and fixing bugs aren’t the same, but they are brought in and paid by the same person. And that person obviously has priorities.

I don’t think I have to bring up paragon, but I will very briefly. One of epics last games, fan and cult favorite that epic killed. The dev work was terrible for fans, and once a bigger money scheme came out they sunk that ship faster then the titanic. The game could have been good, but they didn’t allow it to.

I don’t think I have to bring up Save the World, but I will. Epics last endeavor that lasted in dev hell for years before releasing in a lackluster state. Pay to win systems and a bad progression system held the game back, but with dev work it could be fixed. That game hasn’t gotten the work it should have gotten pre launch, it was promised to be free early this year and it never happened, and it has been all but abandoned for the great battle royal mode.

Epic employees 700+ employees. It’s a large company for essentially supporting ONE GAME. That game has ONE MAP. That has 18 guns total. And the balance of those guns is abysmal. The skins they’ve added almost always requires a buy in of 20 dollars, and they pump those skins and emotes out fast. Every update breaks the game more, the servers cannot handle the strain player numbers put on it. But they decide that a mobile release is more important. They decide another meme emote is more important. And frankly no gun they’ve added has changed the game in any significant way, except in how broken the guided launcher is. 

Epic has hidden all this with a lot of glamour. ‘Oh look at this new shiny thing, new location, ooohh new gold weapon, how about dem impulse nades right!’ They have added almost nothing of substance, and what has been added that is large has been either impressive (lucky, junk) or plain bad for the game (tilted). This game both balance wise and playability wise is gettin worse and worse with every update, and they have done not even close to enough to even be honest. This isn’t even mentioning their terrible customer support. They have money to bring the people they need on and they don’t. The ball has been in their court for months and they keep dropping it. At what point does the community say enough is enough?

This is coming from the heart of a fan. I’ve put 300+ hours in, scores of wins and some great moments. I watched the drake ninja JuJu stream, and I used to wait for updates. But I’m getting sick of the game breaking bugs and terrible balance. This is going to be despised by a lot of people, but I’m going to propose a blackout. Back when it was new the for honor player base did the same thing. It woke the devs up and turned a failed launch into a great game. Epic needs a kick in the pants before it ruins another great idea.

Since I was playing other games at the time I never thought I would be grinding Fortnite as much as I am now. Now, I know it would be BS to just put them in the shop for everyone because that would not make the skin feel as special. But if somehow Epic had a way of knowing when a player started playing Fortnite then maybe they could offer the skins to players who didn't buy them at the time but were still playing Fortnite. Now I know most will not agree with this as most people here didn't play the game back then and it's still a little BS, but maybe you guys can hear me out.

The first step toward this is a ranked system.  In a ranked system, you:

1. Can tangibly measure improvement -- from seeing yourself move up divisions, e.g. bronze silver gold etc.
2. Get to face similarly skilled players -- right now every game has a handful of people who can barely control their character, and some that are godlike builders.  Seeing people with 50% plus win rate when the average win rate is around 1% shows just how crazy skill gaps are.
3. More entertaining streams -- Imagine a world where top streamers faced each other in games, because they're all competing for the top spot on the ladder.

Of course, such a system would be optional, and you'd still be able to queue for ""normals"" (many people have ranked anxiety).  IMO unless a ranked system comes out in the next 3 months, people will start to get tired of the game, as each round is fairly similar with little sense of measurable progression.",FortNiteBR

The other dude (if they are competent) then double ramps out to a point where they can spam a 1x1 and rinse-repeat until someone makes a mistake.

I dunno man, I just miss when not everyone tried to play like myth, and it was like 50% building and 50% shooting.

So about three and a half weeks ago, my Grad school was phished and a lot of our drop box accounts were comprised, mine being one of course. They used my drop box to find me email address, went to my spotify and found my credit card, reverse charged to see if it worked and then took me to the cleaners. I contacted my bank immediately and was able to be put in touch with their fraud team and I eventually got my money back thank god. 

However, these outstanding individuals who decided to steal from me also tried to hack into all of my social and gaming accounts, where all of them had messaged me asking if this was me and I was able to shut them down...Except for EPIC GAMES. 

I receive an email saying ""Congratulations you have successfully changed your Epic Account Password."" Well shit. No i did not. There was then a link at the bottom stating if this wasn't you please contact us immediately with a hyperlink. 

Only problem is that I clicked on that hyperlink, sent an email, and received one back saying ""this email address is not being monitored please contact us through here...which was the same email link."" 

Now I have sent 16 emails over the last three almost four weeks, and have yet to hear a single word from anyone associated with Epic Games. This is simply unacceptable. I am watching real time as some kid on a pc is logging in to my account, spending my vbucks, arranging my inventory and adding his friends from France and there is nothing I can do about it because this little twat changed my password and there is no recovery process available for me.

I know that the only way to contact support is via email, because they dont have a customer support phone line for whatever reason. But I did find their main line for media, internship questions and left a voicemail there stressing to please garner a response to stop this ongoing theft.

This is the most infuriating thing to not hear a response back from anyone for almost a month as I sit by and get logged out of my game because this little thief and watch him just ruin everything I invested in this game.

If there is anyone here please for the love of God message me or help me get this seen so I can just get my account back and stop these guys from stealing any more of my information. This is a fantastic game and even better community but this is so much more than a game. This is an ongoing criminal act that is being ignored by Epic.

TL:DR account was hacked and unauthorized password change occured, sent emails for the last month and no one has responded. Please help me get my game back.

This is the most comfortable mouse Ive ever used, so I make due with it. I currently can play well enough with it to have a 17% Solo winrate. Im sure I could be better if I had a proper gaming mouse with an optical gaming sensor. But Im no pro...so i deal with what I got.",FortNiteBR

Sound of Silence: A fully mute game mode, no in game sounds play at all. Test your ability to play without any audible stimuli to react to. 

Poor Man’s Revenge: Common loot only. Like solid gold, just a struggle instead. 

Barebones: No materials, no building. Breaking down object can still occur

Hardcore: No HUD aside from friendly player names. Ricochet friendly fire. No access to map whatsoever. Test your map knowledge!

Insufficient fare: No bus. All players spawn on the island in a random location, meet back up with your team to survive!

The Minimalists: lower backpack space to 2. You can have two items at a time, choose wisely!


Tell me what you guys think! 
Epic, if you see this, try play testing some of these in the studio! You never know, it might be the next hit!

Every time a badass building clip gets posted here, people get really surprised to learn that it was on console. I totally get why playing with a keyboard seems more efficient when building(hotkeys mainly, mouse control, etc) As a PC player who plays with an xbox controller, I find I can build faster than 90% of the people I come across. I am not bragging, but I just want to point out that it does not matter what input device you use. What matters is practice and muscle memory. Sure, the worlds's fastest builders play on PC, BUT the best console players are not much slower( maybe 5-10% slower) which in reality does not decide the fight 99% of the time. (all stats are completely made up)

To all my console/controller players out there that are having a tough time building fast: Know this, you CAN build just as fast as PC players. Keep practicing and improving as much as you can. Do not let the myth that PC players are better and faster discourage you from improving your building. I have many friends that I play with on xbox that don't commit to getting better at building because they think you have to have a keyboard/mouse or be super-talented to build fast with a controller. 
Practice, practice, practice, and quit using the excuse that you are a console player so you just can't build as fast as PC players!

It's a super fun weapon to use, especially with friends, so I don't want to see it removed. I would just like to see it tweaked so that it isn't nearly impossible to combat it without building an entire house around yourself.

In my opinion, which I have seen around this subreddit, is that the missile should have less health, so low in fact that it could be 1 shotted by any weapon pretty much. Do you know how hard it is to hit that tiny thing 4 times with an AR when it's zigzagging all around on it's way too you? Pretty damn difficult, especially if you are trying to actually shoot a player and destroy the missile. If it could be one shotted by an AR, then attentive players would be able to combat it effectively. This would force the missile user to dodge the bullets or try to attack while the player is distracted, which would make the guided missile take a little bit more skill and/or strategy to be used effectively. This would be a very welcome change because right now the only effective way to counter the guided missile is to build 4 walls and a ceiling around yourself. This change would make the guided missile feel a lot more fair to players playing against it without taking away the fun of using the weapon.

I got the approximate answer.,"So i was asking my self this question and searched everywhere for an answer when i was buying battle pass. It was still like 35 days till the end of the season and the best answer i got was that basically you get 5 tiers out of each week(50 stars = 5 tiers) so in 7 weeks you get 350 stars = 35 tiers. The rest is up to you, how much you play etc. So i decided to buy the battle pass anyways even though my tier was only 29 and calculating this +35 from battle pass i thought that i was gonna reach about 70 at max. But i forgot about daily quests so that brings in total 5 stars a day if you do the challenges; so 5 a day in 35 days is 175 stars = 17.5 tiers. And you still get stars as you lvl up your account(not tier) - about 2 per lvl, 5 milestone = 5 bonus stars, 10 milestone = 10 bonus stars. Considering all of this: 30 free tier + 35.5 battle pass challenges + 17.5 from daily quests + account level. So 83 in total from quest and the rest you should get from lvling meaning just play as much as you can :) I think i was about lvl 40 when i bought it and got to 62 by the end of 2nd week. ( 2 times 22 = 44; 5 times 2= 10; 10 times 2= 20; add up to =&gt; 74 = 7.4 tier) so that brings it to roughly 90 tier and i still have almost a whole month. I would say that it was the last day to buy it for me and i think im going to make it till 100 for sure. Plus i can always use the V-bucks you get from battle tier to unlock tiers. 
If you are considering of buying the battle pass now you can still do it if you have battle tier 40+ !

This would leave only the wall, ramp and stairs in the rotation, making them all 1 button away from each other. It would allow you to build much quicker without having to completely re-design the entire building system on console.

Heres a few situations, and how to do the right thing.

1. Lets say The Storm is coming in, and you're out of the circle. You run near the circle but find yourself in a stalemate where player A Is spamming guided missiles and you're building walls. What do you do? Its quite simple ! DO NOT look at the minimap, or just The Storm in general. If you can't see it, it can't see you. Problem solved.

2. Lets say its situation ""1"", but you're in the circle. You're once again in a stalemate, and you see a squad of John Wicks running up behind you. Now, the solution to this is sort of like situation 1. Just attack the squad, even if your own squad is dead. Now, you might say ""Wait, you can't just build walls and take out an entire squad at the same time! OP! EPIC, REMOVE IT"" but if you ignore the guy shooting the guided missiles, they simply dont exist.

3. Like situation 2, you're in the circle having a stalemate with a guided RPG user in a 1v1. Now, some brain dead noobs might say ""Oh, but you'll run out of materials!"" but that is simply incorrect, since every player has infinite materials.

Now here's the reason why I think the Support Team at Epic is horrible. It literally takes almost a MONTH to get a reply back and that's even if they do respond to you. I sent 6 emails since January and the one I sent on March 15th was barely answered TODAY. I get that there are other people that need help but seriously, a month to reply back seems a little weird. I'd also like to add that they said I had to do 2 different things when they replied. One said I have to change my password and turn on 2 step verification?? I'm guessing the person at Epic didn't read my email right and thought I was taking about my Epic account. The 2nd thing was that I had to make a new epic account and lose my skins that I bought on my Xbox. I really hope Epic's Support team improves because I've seen a lot of other people saying that it takes way to long to get a email back. ",FortNiteBR

I tried talking about this over a month ago but the game was trending to much that nobody was shining enough light on how bad the gameplay really is and now players are finally speaking up but I have yet to hear from the team themselves.  
  
The only other argument I ever come across is that there's different teams working on the game and the cosmetic teams have nothing to do with the teams working on scaling,bug fixes, etc.. but that's a shit excuse and makes no sense. Your telling me that they have a team constantly pushing these cosmetics probably ADDING MORE bugs to the game before the other team can even work on the original bugs that BEEN here for a while now? That's bs and if it isn't than the cosmetic teams should be saving all their work in some storage and release it as the game scales. You know, balance that shit out.  
  
As a ps4 user I find it extrememly difficult to play a good game and to play competitively because of all the bugs from the shitty accuracy to the glitches. This will lose your player base very fast when the community becomes sick of it and another game proves to care more.  
  
If there are troubles with fixing these bugs and what not than just tell us and keep us posted on the conditions and road map or something ! right now it feels like you guys are just playing everyone like a fool while throwing new cosmetics at us to buy.  
  
This sub needs more serious discussion because ever since it became a trendy comedy sub, the epic team think they're doing such a great job by giving us new dances to show off.  
  
A few days ago I noticed an epic employee FINALLY noticed the horrible shotgun accuracy where the critical hit never registered ( this probably happens with all guns all the time) And that's when I realized how clueless their team really is... This been going on for months and they only JUST BARELY addressed it on someones video that got a lot of attention. So what must we do as a community? pretty simple, just speak up and let your voices be heard, that goes a long way! I made this post only because I enjoy this game but I already feel like quiting simply because I want to actually play the game, not just dance around..  
  
I don't know if this a rant but I guess take it however you want, I hope I'm speaking for others as well because I doubt I'm the only one that finds it difficult just to have a normal game without any problems. I'm also not a good writer AT ALL but I still wanted to try because I care. ",FortNiteBR

The dmg falloff starts way too soon and is way too impactful. This makes the ARs feel less rewarding and encourages tower camping and quick peeking from towers.

Headshot multiplier changes:

Silenced pistol got a huge nerf along with the Smgs by reducing their headshot dmg. Silenced pistol was a decent replacement for ARs because of its high Headshot dmg. Now it deals MAX 52dmg headshots and falls off to 40dmg headshots fairly quickly.

Burst ARs:

The burst ARs got a huge nerf with damage falloff. Burst ARs dont benefit from first shot accuracy nearly as much as normal ARs and dmg falloff nerfs the one thing they're really good at..
Bursting down enemies with quick headshots. You can still use them fairly effectively at medium range but the headshot multiplier nerf gutted that pretty hard too.

Revolver and Handcannon:

Damage reduced to 40% at 85 meters. I get that revolver and handcannon must have dmg falloff but 62dmg headshots with a legendary Handcannon is way too low. It used to feel incredible to headshot someone and deal 180+ dmg but now the dmg falloff and headshot multiplier nerf has made the gun a close range gun instead of a medium range sniper.

You can intervene in fights while simultaneously being uninvolved in that fight and having nothing to lose, which to me seems very wrong.

I wasn’t rooting for any of the players I spectated. I was simply rooting for your almost-finished stadium to provide the perfect end game battle setting.

It did.  I’ll never forget it.  Thank you for such a beautiful gift.",FortNiteBR

I can’t shoot accurately without standing in one spot so how am I meant to avoid bullets? You should make a feature where you can move all the buttons around so it can comfort everyone. I prefer to have the shoot on the right rather than the left. It sucks how it is on the left. I know there is another one that’s invisible on the right but that one is way to annoying to use. It is hard to do continued fire with it. I know you do tap tap hold but I just find it easier to only hold down the shoot button.

Every time you do that you literally are telling Epic that you don’t care about the game fixes, you just want new content. 

Why would Epic ever focus on fixing anything if you guys continue to show over and over again that you don’t care. Why would I prioritize something like bug fixes that doesn’t make me money, when people continue to support the game no matter what by buying content. 

You guys think it’s cool because some of the developers respond to comments here. “Wow epic comments in this sub, they must really love us”. 

I’m gonna be honest with you. Epic doesn’t give a fuck about you guys. They are here to make money plain and simple. If they make you happy along the way, it’s a double win for them, but the number one focus is making money. 

Think before you buy that next skin for $20. Seriously guys $20 for a skin for your virtual character? The price gouging is insane, but I don’t even blame Epic because the community continues to buy it. 

VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!",FortNiteBR

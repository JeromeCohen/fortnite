- This helps combat being lasered from across the map, or from medium to far range. Have to be more accurate to hit somebody, which means less chance of being lasered from your sides and back, as the bullet is also a projectile and not hitscan. Also, players are rewarded for aim. 

- If the AR's are taken out and people decide to use suppressed smgs to laser you, then you won't take as much damage as a regular ar, which helps not being lasered from a 3rd party, or from others.

- Would also prevent more weapons having bloom if infantry rifles replace all AR's. ",FortNiteBR

But this season I‚Äôve been managing a 15 win% and mind you I‚Äôm that player that is always looking to do dumb stuff around the map in vehicles or trickshotting etc.  But I find it super easy to counter those pest try hard soccer skins and twitch streamers and their super building techniques.  I‚Äôve never been a bad player at Fortnite, but this season just feels way easier and a lot smoother as well.  So far one of the most fun seasons for me.  I‚Äôm starting to get that season 2-4 feeling back.  Let me know what you all think makes this season harder.",FortNiteBR

Now i know you all are gonna hate me for this but having Team Rumble /Disco Domination/ Food Fight etc is hurting the game more than it's helping it



Yeah, Team Rumble is great for challanges, but think about it, instead of making easier challanges epic decided to introduce a gamemode pretty much where you can respawn and that's full of bots

Yeah casual players should totally enjoy the game, in fact i'm all for that, but there's no way a bad player would enjoy core gamemodes as much as DiscoDomination


And that's not how it should work


If you'll get on the game right now, you'll see that  there are so many sweats while all the average/below average players hang out in team rumble



As a casual player, solos duos or squads are impossible and team rumble is just too easy


No, i have no ideea how to fix this, but before even thinking about it we gotta aknowledge it as a problem, and yes, in my opinion is the biggest one we're having currently in the game

It‚Äôs funny to think that I initially despised this gun. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôve changed my mind:

1. It‚Äôs tap fire. So unless you don‚Äôt have shield, you always have a chance to survive one or two shots before being lasered/killed. If you can‚Äôt react in time to protect yourself, it‚Äôs you‚Äôre fault. This also promotes the usage of skillful aim and W-keying is discouraged. In fact, it‚Äôs almost impossible. 

2. It helps you aim with virtually every other long distance weapon. This gun has truly made me a better shot. I‚Äôm now eliminating players out of the sky when before, I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to use any of the game‚Äôs ADS tools like ‚Äúfirst shot accuracy.‚Äù I‚Äôm hitting trick shots with snipers coupled with balloons when I‚Äôve thought that impossible for me. 

3. It separates the bad from the good. Like the sniper rifle, there is a learning curve to it. This learning curve differentiates it from every other weapon, meaning not everyone *can* or *will* use it effectively. With that, you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to be the only person in your team to use it, meaning more for you! 

4. It‚Äôs just so much fun to use. There‚Äôs nothing like hitting someone for a well deserved 98 with a well placed shot. Additionally, I‚Äôve taken to using it as a replacement for sniping and will actually juke players out by peaking as if I‚Äôm actually sniping. 

I have to say that this is the only weapon that has come out (except for the shockwave grenade and bouncers) that I would be genuinely upset if it were removed. EPIC, please don‚Äôt ever remove this gun.",FortNiteBR

Whilst I and I believe many others enjoy the recent change that grants 50HP/SH when you full-kill someone, in squads it has led to thirsting.

It's a little annoying when you get knocked early game and someone full kills you for shields, and then your squad goes on to do pretty well.

To counter this, or at least to dissuade immediate full killing, I wonder if changing things so that you and your team only get the shield buff when every member of the opposing squad is killed, rather than immediately after full-killing. I'd hope this would encourage people focusing on those still alive rather than immediately turtling up and killing you.

This suggestion is only for squads (potentially duos?) Inb4 git gud - I tried that and I'm still awful.",FortNiteBR

I mean, the pump is the only gun you MUST have in your inventory. You can almost win the game with this single weapon. You can in early game replace it with double pistols (may be with silenced pistol) if the other guy doesn't have a pump and don't move too much... but otherwise I don't see any alternative for close combat... 

Magic combo pump, smg is most of the time the solution. But in every game it's becoming boring.

Whereas for mid range you've got scar, ar, AK47... for long range, scoped AR, snipers, etc... same things with explosives.

But for pump it looks like there is not anymore any alternative. Don't you think there is a short range weapon that is missing in the meta right now ?

&amp;#x200B;

OK to start this post let me just say I really want to reach level 100 this season. I have been playing the game since day one and have never reached level 100 (not tier 100 to clarify lol) or really even tried. The highest level I have been was lvl 94 all the way back in season 3. Ever since season 5 my playing has slowed down a significant amount and I didn't play much at all in seasons 6 and 7, only reaching levels 55 and 70. This season I went all in and bought the entire Battle Pass through tier 100 to get the XP boosts the entire season (ik Im dumb). Now I can only play for about 3 hours on weekdays and 9 hours on weekends so I dont have all the time in the world. I am currently level 40 and I feel like I am not earning XP quick enough to reach lvl 100 by the end of the season. I don't have a squad to play with all the time so I usually run solos and get on average 500xp per game if I lose. I want to earn XP faster and want to reach lvl 100 this season.

Almost three weeks into the game and I've been trying to get the umbrella once. No luck because everytime in the final circle (granted I choked a couple times but still) there are people trying to hit noscopes, spamming miniguns, camping trees and doing 90s finishing with a trap kill. It's frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend who started in the middle of season 6. He was basically taught the sweaty way from the start. I play with him and there's no, 'hey look 21 dynamite wanna see if we can win?'. He never wants to do something stupid like clock tower trolling. He has said this before and believes it with his heart, ""No camping. You have to drop hot drops every game and rush everybody you see or else you aren't good"". What the heck? Is that what fortnite wants new players to think? He has repeatedly rushed entire squads by himself and gotten killed. Once he saw a black knight in a build battle. I told him not to rush, and he said, ""I'M NOT CAMPING!"" and got clapped. In one vs ones he does cheap strats like spamming a grappler when he gets hurt, taking a chug jug and grapplering back into the fight to get a lucky shot until I die. He claims that the drum gun was never op based on his experience in unvaulted.

If you dont want to be in a match with good players then say so but don't rip on people for being better than you, trying harder than you, or playing more than you. I think we all have our sweaty moments and that's what makes this game so amazing. The rush of emotions and the adrenaline that comes with being in an intense battle is something we can all relate to. So instead of separating the ""sweats"" and the ""casual"" players let's go by skill so we can actually move forward with this topic. Ranked matchmaking is necessary for Fortnite's future so everyone has a place where they can improve and challenge themselves without dealing with an extremely unfair skill gap. We are working our way towards it with the tournament's but If we want this game to live on we need a way for all types of players to be engaged. We aren't getting any closer to this with the notion that if someone is better than you they are automatically a try hard sweaty trying to ruin the casual players fun. We all want to have fun that's what video games are about and I think there should be a place in fortnite for players of all skill levels to have their fun while keeping the regular matchmaking established for people who don't care who they get in a game with. At the end of the day we all just want to have some fun playing a game we love. Whatever we do lets try to find some common ground as a community and try to make this game fun for everyone.

But what if... this was not the case? 

Ladies and gentlemen, we got him. In other news, I present too you, the 500 V-Bucks Pack! 

*(Just imagine some guy taking a sparkling red blanket off a box on a stage)*

The 500 V-Bucks Pack is a Pack you can purchase at any time for 4.99 USD, this pack includes only 500 V-Bucks, however whenever a new Starter Pack releases, (Rouge Agent, Wingman, Cobalt, etc), it will replace the 500 V-Bucks  Pack and still include an extra 100 V-Bucks, and sure you could buy the Starter Pack and then buy a 500 V-Bucks Pack and essentially pay 11$ for a 10$ item, but come on, your only getting a dollar more once every about 2-4 months. Is it really that much? 

So now, you can steal your moms credit card and buy the Super Rare Brite Bomber and do Take The L on all those Default Skins and get that **EPIC** Victory Royale!

The Gauntlet Cups are terrible and do not serve us!,"So people have been begging for a ranked mode for a while.  Why?  Generally because us bots are sick of getting wrecked by significantly better players.

Enter The Guantlet Cups.  Our supposed savior.

I just played 5 games in a row and finished with 14 total points.  I got my 14 points by landing just west of Dusty Divot, landing in a bush, and setting my controller down for the next 10 minutes.

On my way to the 14 points I saw numerous sweats doing 90s and edit shooting me, as well as other players.  I can not do 90s and I sure as hell can't do edit/shotgun attacks on people.

I should not be earning points by setting my controller on the ground.  I should be earning points based on whether or not I show any skill.

The Guantlet Cup feeds bots to the wolves and needs a serious overhaul based on skill rather than top 25 placements.",FortNiteBR

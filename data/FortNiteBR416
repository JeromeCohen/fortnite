I vote no. 

People who want M+KB should play the PC version. This trend of people wanting M+KB support for console multiplayer games is absolutely baffling to me. One of the big pros of console play is the controller standard (along with graphics). So, to completely screw over the vast majority of the console playerbase who prefers controllers just to appease a few players who want to use a control method that will allow them to play at a much higher level is asinine to me. 

Now, seeing that there is crossplay, I wouldn't see an issue with allowing M+KB input method if the player was playing with a PC friend (and therefore on PC servers). Or, to extend that thought, if the PS4 player wants to willingly play on PC servers themselves, then sure, allow for M+KB to be enabled. But, I really feel that controllers and M+KB need to be kept separate as they are vastly mismatched when it comes to functionality.",FortNiteBR

I have an idea. Instead of our character freezing immediately, it would be great to show off our sick new dance moves after we slay the last person! 5, 10, or even 15 seconds of letting our character still be able to move around would be awesome. I feel like this would be a very simple feature to add.

I purchased the original PvE version, and have recently begun to enjoy the Battle Royale as well. However, I do have some issues.

Sometimes the game crashes or you DC. Add to the fact that I enjoy playing with my squad mates, I have often ended up leaving them to fend for themselves.

Are you looking into adding a function that lets us rejoin our active game? So that my squadmates can defend my DC'd ass while I restart - instead of them having to go on without me?

However, often times, they don't have mics and we have no means of communicating. Why not add a text chat? The left and right D-Pad buttons are unused, it can be added there. It could be a near-copy of Rocket League, where if you click the left D-Pad button, you could have the option of saying 4 things(by clicking another direction on the D-Pad), and the right D-Pad button 4 other things. For example, the left D-Pad button could be directionals, so if you clicked left-up, text chat would pop up for your team saying ""North!"", left-down would say ""South!"", and so on for east and west. Then, the right D-Pad could have other chat options, things like ""Need an AR!"" or ""I need bullets!"" or even just things like ""Nice shot!"".

I personally believe that milking peoples money (even if its a $10 battle pass) is just totally wrong when the game lacks the ability to be run on low spec machines and even high end machines. Tell me, how can a gtx 1080 8 gb run on EPIC settings at only 100 fps? With insane dips and unstable FPS? With freezing/stuttering. Seems disgusting to me. Today i bought myself a GTX 1060 3gb because i figured it was time for an upgrade from my GTX 960. I was pretty excited to launch Fortnite expecting dank FPS and a nice silk smooth gameplay. However i was met with absolute disgust when i got in game and found that my problems have persisted even with a factory new GTX 1060. Low fps on MEDIUM SETTINGS. Stutter/freezing every so often. Im glad i havnt bought this $10 battle pass or even spent any sorta money on this game because it simply isnt worth it. Not when these problems still exist.

Except that there's one problem with the game.

That problem? The rocket launcher.

Almost every single game i played and survived in the top 10 (surprisingly easy since nobody checks bushes) ended with rocket spam. there is no reason to use a normal gun if you have a rocket launcher with enough ammo, it's just better. It destroys everything in one shot, is easy to aim, has a massive aoe radius and on top of that it has a lightning fast reload (the bolt action is crying). I understand that the rocket launcher is necessary for late game fort fights but it is simply too effective against people. 

Fort wars? The people with more rockets will win. Dare to peek out and attack? Enjoy a poorly aimed rocket dealing 110 damage, if you have no shields you are dead.

The game should not be decided because one person/squad had better luck with ammo.

Possible solutions:

Reduce rocket AoE by 50%

Reduce rocket AoE damage falloff distance by 75% (think direct hit from tf2)

Reduce max ammo to 4

Reduce rocket damage to players by 50%

Heavily reduce accuracy

Heavily increase projectile falloff, making it as hard to use as the GL

The root of the problem is easy to trace back though. Problem is that the encounters are ENTIRELY luck based: The person with the better weapon wins.

Not a single time where I died, I thought ""well, ok, I need to do better"". Most of the times I died tonight was because I landed and the other person had a gun, and I didn't.

Solution? Just take away the luck aspect: Simply give everyone some guns.

I don't get this,  why should it matter how many wins you have to play the game?  Some people just don't have the time to play 24/7 so they can't get as many wins.  If I could play as much as these people I wpuld easily have over 100 wins EASILY but I have college and other things to do. When I do play I get wins, I just don't play enough to get as many as these people.

The first time I tried to build down a mountain. I fell through not 1, not 2, but 3 builds and didn't stick the landing. Needless to say, I almost threw my controller through my neighbor's window. 

The second time I was pushing the last 2 people alive that were on top of and downstairs (outside) at modern house in Pleasant. I built ramps to run up on the roof guy first only to run right through my second ramp piece and land right in front of downstairs dude's face. After he obliterated me in 1 shot, I watched for a second to make sure and I 100% built the second ramp piece. I just ran right through it. 

I've noticed other posts about this. I believe this should have been fixed already as it's a devastating glitch to overall gameplay. Until it is, I'm only playing until I finish my daily challeges. I can speak for a few friends, they've also come to this conclusion. ",FortNiteBR

So I was gonna refill on some V-Bucks, 9.99 worth of them, and 100 Swedish Kronor is (according to interwebz) almost exactly the amount. So I filled up my PayPal with around 105 Kronor and went to buy some and it kept failing, so I double checked everything and PayPal said I had around 13 dollars which converted to Kronor is like 110, so I figured I was all good and kept trying to purchase these V-Bucks and then I triple checked on PayPal this time using Euros and it was splitting hairs cause in Euros I had 9,95 something so I knew what was wrong, and filled up my PayPal with some more money and thought I'd be able to finally purchase this beautiful skin after 2-3 hours of fiddling with PayPal and getting the right amount it says I'm blocked from making purchases.

I just really, really, _really_, want my Nog Ops skin before it disappears. If someone at Epic sees this and can help me out I'd be so happy. I'll be updating this thread so if you guys can or have the time to fix this issue for me, yeah, I'd be super grateful.

Are there any guides out there or anything about ways I can adjust my speakers to hear stuff like footsteps at a lower volume? The only way I can ever hear them is if I crank it loud, which makes gunshots far too loud.

So i said screw it,Squads solo no fill.  FYI, i have about 1KD in solo's so im not that good. 

 I figured i would loot a few homes and i only needed to outlive 75.   Easy peasy.  Headed over to greasy to find it hadnt been looted..  I found a team there, I was able to get a dirty snipe on a guy, threw a grenade to elimiate him.  I got into a gunfight with the rest of the team, being outnumbered and running low on scar bullets, i fled for the mountain.  
   Droped down into the circle got another pick with the sniper, but coudlnt finish him off.  Down to 16 guys, i was happy to get the bounty done.   Figured my time was up pretty quick.   The storm pushed me to a bridge.   So climbed underneath and set up shop. Started taking lots of fire, so i had to drop down to the water.   Built back up, 8 left..    I could hear gunfire,  flanked around on the opposite side of the bridge, got 2 kills, and one guy came up behind me.. Shotgunned him,  He dropped a rocket launcher.  I checked teh scoreboard,  3 left..  I was actually blown away,  I see one guy , whip out the scar, knocked him down.  Now my heart was racing.  Never in my life would I thought this would be possible.  His partner flanked me, so built up a bit and just launched a rocket,   VICTORY...

I was so stoked, ear to ear grin.  IM not sure i could get another one..  Ill take the Dub.  ",FortNiteBR

If you guys ever revisit this game mode, or plan on adding other game modes in the future, you need to seriously consider ways to report people who are acting against their team. It should be treated no differently than team killing.

Additionally, pretending to revive someone over and over while just letting them bleed out is also an issue.

Our plans have changed a bit. We won’t be testing this publicly in 2017, and are planning for early 2018. Our initial plan was to offer an opt-in PTR (Public Test Realm) where players can test out the new shooting model, but we’ve decided to feature the new shooting model as a Limited Time Mode. This change gives us a bit more time to tune and refine the feature and allows console players to participate.

This means the PTR will be put on hold for the foreseeable future. Thanks for understanding everyone!

In the meantime, we want to hear your thoughts on the current shooting model, and suggestions for the future.

As everyone always says, I've been playing for months already because the gameplay is just so fun, yada yada yada, but now that they've added an incentive program, there's just nothing that compares.

When they first released the update with the level 25 glider, I played my tail off to get it. Then I wanted more, and now we finally have it.

First of all, I've wanted to buy some v-bucks for a while just to support the game, but I don't really care for any of the specific skins and $10 was a lot for just one item. So the $10 for me isn't just a great price, it's the perfect price.

Secondly, equpping the items earned and using the emotes kind of show off your skill, or at least your experience. I'm still only the squire, but I just unlocked the first harvesting tool and I'm actively working towards the glider now.

A problem I (and I'm sure many others) had with buying skins is that it was completely unnecessary and didn't mean anything about how good you are, so making them a reward was genius.

We had been asking for this for a while and EPIC really delivered once again. It's funny what happens when the devs and players have mutual respect for each other as human beings. The gaming industry was beginning to feel a bit like the government. Thanks once again.",FortNiteBR

I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

There are 70 Battle Pass tiers and each battle pass tier requires 10 battle points (BP) to level up. This means you need a total of 700BP to complete your pass by the end of the season, which is February 20th. For gaining season levels NOT ending in a 0 or 5, you earn 1BP each time you level up. If the season level ends in 5 you earn 5 BP, and if it ends in 0 you earn 10BP.

Since you start at level 1, you do not earn a point for that level, so ranking up to the max season level of 100 you earn a total of 229BP. This means you still need 471BP to reach tier 70, which now can only be earned from daily challenges since you're at the max level. 

Daily challenges give BP in increments of 5, and you get 2 challenges per day if you do own the battle pass. This means it will take 48 days of doing 2 daily challenges every day to reach max battle pass level without spending any vbucks. If you reinvest the 1200 vbucks you get from leveling up your Battle Pass, that cuts out 8 levels (they cost 150 vbucks each) so you're still looking at needing to complete 80 daily challenges, or 40 days worth.

The season has 67 remaining days, which means anyone who buys the battle pass after January 11th is flat out unable to complete their pass without spending additional money, regardless of how much they play. 

The most obvious solution to this problem is to remove the season level cap and continue to give out BP for leveling. Another option is keep the level cap at 100, but keep the xp meter going and every time the player would usually level up, just give them some BP for it instead.

Personally I'm very happy with the battle pass and can't wait to continue unlocking the new content (nearly tier 7 already!), but I just wanted to point out this flaw and see if the community had any other thoughts about it. 

Obviously this is Epic's first draft at the battle pass system and I fully expect to see changes down the road, and I think now is the time to voice what we would like to see done with it in the future. 

**TL;DR** If you dont reach level 100 season level and do not complete 80 daily challenges over the course of the 67 days in this season, you will not earn enough Battle Points be able to reach tier 70 on your Battle Pass.",FortNiteBR

Is there like a full version of the game? What do you get for it?

Can you pick your character or anything?

How do you get upgrades etc? I saw some people with different parachutes and it seemed like they were landing much faster than us...

There was like an in game shop but wasn't sure if anything was worth getting or not?

Maybe even something like $10 plus 1000 vbucks or a discount for having bought the previous. I honestly think a lot more people will buy the pass for $10 than $20 and from what I’ve heard from others and my own experience I think $120 a year is too much, plus the big spenders will just buy all the tiers and you’ll still gain $80 a season from them, maybe up the price for theirs? Anyways that’s just my 2 cents. What does everyone else think?

Epic games won’t allow you to link your PSN/XBL account because it creates a temporary account.

This problem only occurs if you create a separate epic account after choosing not to via your console platform.

Anyways, to reconnect your epic games account to the intended e-mail you must:

Step 1: Log in to Epic games website via console platform; either PC, PlayStation, or Xbox.
Step 2: Register the nameless account with a separate e-mail.
Step 3: Disconnect the epic games account from the secondary e-mail. You will have the option under your console it’s connected with.
Step 4: Log in to primary e-mail.
Step 5: Choose which platform to connect your epic games account to, this will open a pop-up in which you will have to log on to your platforms website.
Step 6: Accept the conditions. 

And voilà; your epic games account will now be linked to the correct e-mail.

Sorry if this has been posted before; had to look at a couple different threads to piece it all together.

If for instance I got the most expensive pack in Save The World then things like the battle pass and extra skins and whatnot should also be included in Battle Royal as well.

If these were two separate games I would understand however they're not, they are the same game just different modes, the fact that we are forced to download both even if we only care about one mode further shows that we should get benefits for both games.

Not the biggest deal in the world but would be nice, considering how much it costs (It's quite a bit) the content you get from buying Save The World isn't all that great especially when you consider the games going to be free at some point in 2018.

Edit: I'm not asking for much, depending on the tier you bought you should get something for it, for instance standard edition gets nothing I suppose, deluxe edition gets the first battle pass for free, super deluxe gets the first battle pass free as well as a limited edition skin of their choosing (Maybe five to choose from or something), limited edition gets two free battle passes and all five limited edition skins.

I'm not asking for much, but something would be nice.

Edit 2: You have to remember that Battle Royal didn't exist for awhile, we paid for Fortnite because we wanted it early and we wanted the benefits that came with it, a new mode comes out so we should also get benefits for that as well, remember it's not a new game, it's a new mode, Fortnite is the game, Battle Royal and Save The World are the modes, we originally paid for Fortnite therefor we should receive benefits in Fortnite no matter how many new modes get released.

If Battle Royal was a completely different game with a separate download then it would make sense but since both modes are combined and are treated as one game then when you pay real money you should get items for both, don't forget that Save The World is going to be free as well which further shows that this is one game that is combined in a single package and as such they should be treated that way. If I pay $150 for Fortnite then I expect to get cool shit for both modes within the game, again I'm not asking for much.",FortNiteBR

Tip 1 - Play 50v50.
50v50 is by far the best game mode if you want to get XP. With easy kills and quick wins, playing 50v50 will definitely help you get more XP, and it doesn’t even ruin your stats!

Tip 2 - Squad up with people who purchased the battle pass.
Whether you own the Battle Pass or not, playing with teammates who have is a great idea. Those Team XP boosts are very useful, and having a full squad of 4 with these boosts has helped me grind the battle pass drastically. Find those friends! 

Tip 3 - Go for kills!
Kills are another great way of getting that XP. If you see someone put you name in them! Follow them or attack from a far, anything to get a kill. Just remember, sometimes you have to lose a fight to win one, always learn from you mistakes.

Tip 4 - Do those daily challenges!
Fairly self explanatory but usually they are easy and take 1-3 matches to complete. Thanks Spazinski!

That’s about it, if you want that infamous “Black Knight” you gotta grind but I assure you it’s worth it. Thanks for reading and I hope my tips were helpful.

The whole ""holy shit"" moment to see someone with a black knight skin or even getting it myself vanished. There's no way to express your ""skill"" or time consumed by the game because you can simply buy everything. 

Look, I get it, they want to profit from people who maybe doesn't have the time to put into the game as others but you're kind of ignoring your hardcore fanbase when you can buy everything, maybe have at least 1 skin that is only obtainable through playing the game?

For me, skins is all about looking good but also showing people your achievements. Getting a hard earned skin and showing it off is a lot of fun and it's pretty cool finding someone else who's managed to obtain something rare.

So, they're all underpowered but worst of all...they're boring.  When are we getting the crazy fun stuff like invisibility potions, jet packs, digital decoys, drones, radar detectors, or sticky traps etc...?  Maybe none of those are possible but hopefully you know what I mean.

Theres a problem though with this battlepass. People can buy tiers, and rank up through them in an instant to get emotes and skins faster. 

To me, this takes away an incentive because I know I could just spend money if I so choose to. And it makes me even more so, think less of someone else’s game time and achievement if I see them emoting the worm, or wearing the black knight on day one. 

Last season was an iffy thing because you had to get up to a level THEN purchase the skin, but at least I knew when I saw people in the level 25 (or 30 can’t remember) skin and with the 35 (or 45 can’t remember lol) pickaxe, I knew they had time spent on the game.

All I think, is that the battlepass shouldn’t have a way to rank up through the tiers involving money. We can already purchase the pass, and daily/weekly skins, but why loose the only major show off achievements in the game? 

TL&amp;DR: Battlepass shouldn’t have a option to level up through the tiers with v-bucks because of the lack of actual achievement. ",FortNiteBR

What isn't fine is player damage. The blue rocket launcher is a solid example of what the player damage should be for a golden launcher. As is, rocket launcher late game are almost a win condition. That is unacceptable. The late game battles should be determined by skill, who outguns who, who plays smarter, all that good jazz. That all goes down the toilet when legendary or purple rocket launchers come into play. Late game, when the circle gets small, if two equally smart and skilled players face off against each other, one has a shotgun and one has a rocket launcher, the person with the rocket launcher wins the fight given they have equal ground. And in close range battles? Forget the shotgun, pull out that HIGH SKILL CAP rocket launcher and use that as your shotgun for a free win. What needs to happen is rocket launchers should do the same damage they have been doing to structures, while doing significantly less damage to players. People suggest a nerfing reload speed which is a decent idea, but to me it still doesn't solve the problem. ",FortNiteBR

I really enjoyed Fortnite during this period I really just wanted to play PUBG. My main thoughts are below:

- Fortnite is so much faster than PUBG, I love that you can drop in for 1 minute for a bad match. I would say a typical Fortnite win is between 20-25 minutes, whereas PUBG is 30+ minutes.

- Fortnites progression is far superior with the inclusion of the battle pass, beforehand I preferred PUBG. I think the battle pass system makes so much sense compared to PUBG's system.

- Fortnites guns feel more satisfying, they feel like they actually pack a punch. When you hit someone in fortnite for 90, there's an immense feeling of satisfaction when compared to a blood splatter, it's simple but it's fundamental.

- The inventory and weapon system is far simpler in Fortnite, no explanation needed.

- At least on Xbox One X, Fortnite can nearly always hit 4k at 60fps, somewhere PUBG I feel will never touch this. As the game was made from the ground up it really works fantastically. Hats off to the Fortnite Team!

Overall, I feel far more satisfied playing Fortnite than PUBG so I will continue mainly playing Fortnite. What do you guys think? Would love some discussion around this from both sides.

The character is so dark and at first glance seems to have an unfair camo advantage in shadows/at night. Obviously we have not yet seen it in action, so this is just speculation... But in a game where survival and hiding are crucial elements of gameplay, the Black Knight seems to have a distinct advantage over other characters. 

To offer some background, I was so happy when I first downloaded the game and saw that there was no real pay to win DLC. No 20$ rocket launcher  or ammo packs. But when the Skull Trooper was introduced,  I had a small issue given the fact that that characters model is also dark, but the white outline of the bones helps. But in looking at the Black Knight, the entire character is black with some red. 

Epic, I love your game and I love your support but I'd honestly rather just pay you 20$-60$ straight up instead of locking off content to microtransactions. I understand that it is very difficult to balance cosmetic skins, but the Black Knight skin makes me feel like I need to buy the battle pass to have an edge on my opponents.

To play devil's advocate, it's possible that the Black Knight will stick out like a sore thumb in fields/daylight, but I'm doubtful. I imagine a scenario where the generic characters were the DLC and the Black Knight was the default character...I could see an argument that the green/brown pallet is unfair camo. ",FortNiteBR

1) Spend way too much time hovering around where we roughly think the cursor is in the hopes we luckily land on what we need to. 

2) Quickly rush back to our controllers just for navigating the menus.

just wanted to make a short rant about the patch notes and one line that will affect all of us players.

The line of the grenades / grenade launcher showing a preview arc.

Im deciding to be in the position to protest against it.
Because not only makes it the game more casual, but it takes
away from one of the areas players really want to nourish their gaming experience with.

And that is satification , the experience of landing something more difficult.

The reason im posting this , is because todays thread of anti casual got 4200 upvotes . which is quite allot.

Im listing now a few things that already dumbed down the game , and thankfully one of them got revoked.

- Rifle recoil got reduced so hitting is now very easy for every player . The idea of trying less and having less satification succeeding is now in place.

- Unbuildable areas are buildable now , hint hint . Mostly on Retail Row it used to be a hassle to approach highground , which doesnt mean its bad overall. its just a different town with different terrain in my mind.

- Getting ammunation from Boxes when the ammunation is exiting behind the shelf . This change wasnt neccessary either becuase you need 1-2 hits to destroy the shelf. Adding some extra mind work

- sniper rifles keep you in scope while reloading.
Thankfully this got revoked , it adds a more cool niche to them how they were designed in basis.

I dont know about other things that might have been dumbed down. 
But seeing this Nade change makes me really sad , im a player who always picks up nades and a nade launcher if possible and got really good with it , earning allot of praise and feeling good while doing so.

This will dissapear for everyone , and its a part of pubg i cannot stand , that their grenades have a preview. 
It is honestly not neccessary to have a preview at all. It makes it just more weird and more boring.

Please dont keep this change and let more active players and new players use their mind a bit more . So we can enjoy the game longer before it gets to casual and uninteresting.

Thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

From the moment the match starts i either alt tab or go do something else. The moment the bus reaches the end i pull my glider and land somewhere with whatever weapon i can get, usually just some stuff someone else left behind after a kill.

Then i walk to the eye, get as close to the center as i can get and just go afk for a loooonnnnnnng time in a good hiding spot. Most of the time im never found and come back to 10-15 players remaining. See the problem here? By simply being afk i outlasted nearly 90% of the population.

I propose a faster mode where the storm starts closing in the moment the match starts and doesnt stop. It should go only slightly faster than defualt run speed but only slightly slower than sprint speed.

As it stands the only reason i log out after a few matches each day is sheer boredom. It's only exciting at the end- or for the impatient who decide to go nuts at the begining and drastically reduce their chances of winning.

A rare (blue) bolt action does 105 damage body shots. Meaning to kill someone it takes 

100 hp: 1 sniper 

150 hp: 1 sniper shot, 2 AR shots (any rarity). 

200 hp: 1 sniper shot, 3-4AR shots (depending on rarity)

-————————————————————————

The Legendary (gold) bolt action does 116 damage body shots. So to get a kill it takes:

100hp: 1 sniper shot

150hp: 1 sniper shot, 2 AR shots (UNLESS you also have legendary scar: 116+35=151 it only takes 1 AR shot)

200 hp: 1 sniper shot, 3 AR shots (any rarity)


TL;DR for people who don’t like numbers: the legendary bolt is only better then the rare bolt if the person you’re shooting at has 200 HP. 

I think that the legendary bolt should do 120 damage. This would keep the same number of shots in the 200HP category, but with any rarity of AR it only takes 1 bonus AR shot to down someone with 150 shields, actually making it better then the blue AR most of the time. 
Edit: formatting and grammar
Edit2: PSA They both do over 200 damage headshots so that doesn’t have any effect.

I’ve seen people request things like having chests contain primarily high end loot and that’s it (only gold/purple scars, snipers, etc. no low tier weapons), having friendly fire turned off in regular game types, faster rate of getting from the bus to the ground, etc.

I seriously think that it would aid the growth of fortnite.  When I have people over and we’re playing the generic cod or FIFA, we get pissed off at the mechanics and then I’ll tell them about this awesome game that is always developing and easy to pick up but hard to put down with game devs that actually care about their users.  Their next question is “well then why don’t we play it if you love it so much?” Then I let them know it can’t happen.

I recognize that there are so many awesome game types but duos with a splitscreen option in my opinion would make it a game you play with your friends when they are with you that they then go home and download and play with their friends.

The whole “YO YOU GOTTA DOWNLOAD THIS SICK GAME TO PLAY DUOS WITH ME” just hasn’t worked that well.  I think in showing my pals when we are together would hook them because I could show them the ropes personally.

I was thinking to introduce more balanced gameplay and to prevent towers from being the end all be all of BR. What if they introduce C4 as a weapon.

It wouldn't be OP because the player would still need to reach the base of the structure without dieing. 

But if the player were to place it on all 4 walls, it would bring the structure down (assuming it's a simple tower with only one base).

It could even introduce an element of trapping...you could put C4 in building or loot packages or even in your tower as a defense mechanism.

C4 would either be activated by the detenator or could be shot or explode from grenades/rpgs.

I think it would at least Force players to take into consideration that their tower isn't all mighty and maybe even cause a little less camping.

Now C4 that is found would come in batches of 4 so one more than lethal and smoke grenade. That would force the player to use it more sparingly or find more.

In said post Mooney writes this: ""So, grab those last Victory Royales and Seasonal rewards!"".  

Reading this, I felt like I’m missing something.  
What rewards was he referring to?  

Is there anything beyond the Glider reskin you obtain at level 25 and the... bus icon(Which you can obtain in just a couple of hours) that i wasn't aware of?

And if there wasn't,why word it the way he did (Or even bother mentioning it at all)?  

I later asked this question in the Official Fortnite Discord, in which one of the higher ranked Moderators tells me  that Mooney was also referring to the items you can purchase from the seasonal shop.  

What...?  

Does paying for the R tickets after I pass the age requirement, is me being REWARDED by the Cinema?

Does paying for a roller coaster ride in an Amusement park after I pass the height requirement, is me being REWARDED by the company who owns it?

Then how are items we pay the same premium currency for,
that were arbitrary chosen to have a level lock, which are no different in the level of design or pricing(Character skins still costing 1200, glider costing 800, and  the Epic Pickaxe costing 1500) considered a ""REWARD"" to the players?

You aren't REWARDING me by allowing me to purchase a service that you put behind an artificial level lock.

Treating the seasonal shop as ""REWARDS"" for the players, is not only wrong by the definition of that word, but also from a PVP only player standpoint - heavily insulting.

If you are looking into it, please say so. Id rather wait knowing that you are working on it that feel like you are ignoring the issue.

**EDIT:** I have been recording my games and what i recognized so far is that the hitch happens every 61 seconds (which coincides with the [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7gu8aq/hitching_analysis_after_the_update/) made by /u/Cravot) and my fps lock to 30 for a fraction of a second, then back to 100-120.

So its safe to say that its the exact same issue that we experienced before the hotfix prior to the 1.10 patch, described by a dev in the post i linked above, who said:

&gt; It's caused by the memory garbage collector which runs about every minute in the game client. Every single object on the map is currently loaded for the entire match, and it can be too much to handle in a single frame. We're planning to address this in an upcoming patch by only keeping objects in memory that are around your player.
Some additional details about this change are in the ""Map Streaming"" section of our State of Development blog post. https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-v3

You also have this ping wheel that drops little markers where you're pointing.  They say things like ""build here"" and ""look over there I see a guy no like over the hill like ok do you see that pine tree so like *behind* the tree no my left.""  

I feel like these would be really useful in pvp mode.  Also, you can mark enemies.  Like you push the button while your cursor is over an enemy and they get a little hunter's mark on their head so you can focus fire.  That might be neat too.  

And it might be cool to have those green arrows from 50v50 over teammates' heads in general, I find them super useful.  Or maybe player outlines for teammates so you can see how far they are and keep track of them a little easier?  In pve mode you can see zombie outlines, so they have the ""technology"" to make players visible through walls.

And while I'm talking about pve features I want in pvp, how about if you own an epic hero in pve you get it as a skin in pvp?  And if your pickaxe is upgraded you get the skin?  Maybe if you win a game of pvp you get a mini llama for pve?  And how about we get a legendary one use item that summons a llama or teddy bear, like the outlander gets?  Or air strikes?  They could be crate only items, or put them in higher level chests or safes.  One time use, like the bush, that simulate special abilities like in pve.  Adrenaline rush would be great too.

Depending on which team you are on one half of the map will appear to have the storm on it indicating which side you must go to. 

After the first minute, each team will see where their flag has spawned and the middle line will expand turning into a neutral zone where both teams can meet and exchange fire. The Neutral zone will never include the flag location in this phase. The goal is to get here in the remaining 3 minutes of protected build time and start building a base around the flag or preparing for attack.

After the 4 minutes of protected build time are over the storm changes, the storm becomes an oval that decreases over time eventually stopping to include both flag locations. 

**DBNO:** In CtF you don't bleed out. You get downed and the other team is encouraged to keep you alive. Every 1.5 minutes a drop crate will be awarded to the team with the most ""prisoners"". You are considered a prisoner when you are downed. To keep them DBNO the opposing team is encouraged to build around players to get them stuck. This allows people to get revived and help the cause or to end their strife by giving up potentially helping their team win a care package,

**Flag Carrying:** When a player grabs the enemy flag they are holding it until they drop it. It can be used as a melee weapon but does minimal damage. The flag will sit where it is dropped until picked back up or returned to base by it's team. To return the flag they ""revive"" it taking around 10 seconds to accomplish. 

**Scoring:** Run the enemy flag to your own flag's home to win the game. If your own flag is not at your base it must be returned to win. Alternatively, if the entire enemy team is downed you win!

**Edit:** How would everyone feel about 25v25v25v25? Could be fun with smaller teams and multiple bases to attack. Makes it more unpredictable but still team oriented and exciting.",FortNiteBR

I still dont know how the desk is still standing.

RNG - 
Shields have to go, or put them in the drops where you are rewarded for putting yourself in a bad position. A player should not be rewarded for simply opening a crate. Simple as that.

Suggestion: Make crates spawns static. Everyone know where they are why not make them static? I landed in a house by myself in salty earlier and left with no gun and ONLY light ammo. How the hell am I going to kill someone. RNG back at it again.

Health -
Remove shields. Allow bandages to bring you to 100 but not instantly allowing medkits to still have its place. No reason I should be at 2 shot kill health because I am an aggressive good player who searches for fights.

Foosteps -
Looks like footsteps are bugged. Nerds coming right behind me and 2-3 shot spamming before I can turn around. Balanced gameplay.

TTK (time to kill)
As it stands the ttk is exetremely short unless you have been blessed by the RNG gods and given their blue cum. Removing shields + allowing bandages to heal to 100 in addition to nerfing all weapons to slow down ttk would put the game in a good place. 

Like I said in the title, the devs have been like some we have never seen before from a game, especially a battle royal, and I know you guys will make the proper decisions required to ascend fornite to the next level.

If anyone disagrees or has a different or similar view on the changes that should be made let me know. I am open minded and would love to hear your thoughts.",FortNiteBR

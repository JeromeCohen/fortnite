-They are jumping constantly while rapidly switching weapons mid-jump.

-They randomly build ramps for no apparent reason while simply running around 

-They run around with the sniper equipped and are constantly looking through the scope

-They literally never stand still, even while material farming

-They have the ""default"" skin equipped with the black space bag

*Bad*:

-They literally never ""sprint"", simply jog around the map

-They seem to stop and think before doing anything, such as looting, building, switching weapons, opening doors, etc

-They have the bush equipped

-They have the ""default"" skin equipped with no back bling, default glider, default pickaxe

I've always been the type to hate claymores, and trip mines and other trappyish things from other shooters, and quite honestly I despise them just as much in this game. 

They've certainly made me laugh a few times throughout my time playing fortnite, but overall I feel like traps cater to players without as much gun skill, while slowing pace of play because it's much more difficult to be aggressive through places with a lot of buildings. 

And then my BIGGEST problem with them is that you can fully eliminate a team/duo and their traps remain there. That simply does not make sense, if they're dead and gone out of the game, their trap should be gone. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is becoming Paragon 2.0. Epic continues to hide behind this ""early access, pre-alpha"" label to mask the deteriorating quality of their games. Just like for Paragon, Epic dishes out new ""content"" and updates that are rarely tested and only cause more bugs and OPness in the game. For example, when they initially released Greystone (Paragon), the new shotgun, guided missile, and port-a-fort (Fortnite), the games were broken immediately. Also, just like Paragon, Fortnite was a fantastic game initially until Epic started to add too many things that don't make any sense. Why add another shotgun when there are already two types? Why add a LMG when there is already a gattling gun? Why add a port-a-fort? Epic ruined something great in Paragon and they are doing the same with Fortnite. Epic, focus on quality, not quantity.

I just have a hard time justifying the cost for one new costume for that much. I understand the game is free to play but if you value a full game at 60$, you will only be able to buy around 3-6 skins before you reach value of a normal game.

This saddens me.

I am not taking away the fact that Fortnite is fun and addictive, hell I play it a lot too. Its the fact that everyone I know who has said this has never played any story based, single player game before or even any other games. But I have a theory is going to change very fast and its going to impact the longevity of Fortnite very much.

As a lot of you know, the new God of War is coming out very soon on PS4. This game has been getting 10/10s and is being praised as the best hack and slash of all time. With amazing combat and an amazing story that finally gives Kratos some kind of character development.

The theory is that a lot of these people who have never played a game at this caliber will try this and realize that there is so much more than Fortnite out there that they can play. That there are amazing worlds and deep lore to discover in these games that they might start playing even more amazing single player games on PS4 like The Last of Us Remastered and personal favorite Metal Gear Solid 5.

TL;DR: With the new God of War coming out, people who got PS4s just to play Fortnite will have a new perspective on videogames if they play God of War, with them opting to embark on story rich adventures more than playing online games.",FortNiteBR

Then I'll play with my usual squad buddies that all have decent stats and all of a sudden half the game consists of intense build battles and double ramp rushing. I'm fine with this too as it's fun to challenge myself, but I'm curious if SBMM snuck its way into Fortnite as kind of a test by Epic.

If any of you have played Halo and Modern Warfare 3, I'm sure you remember the infected gamemode . I'd love to see this implemented in some way. Zombies only have their hands and if you get hit once you're out . Zombies can't destroy structures , but I don't know if they should be able to build or not .. if they couldn't then it would be nearly impossible to kill the survivors if they could build . Or maybe none of them could build . I'm not sure , somebody help me figure this out . Let me know what you guys think. 

Edit : thought of some more ideas myself , and with help from people in the comments ( shoutout to you guys ) 

- zombies move faster . they can spawn ( after infected ) with inventory slots filled with impulse grenades that they use to "" jump "" on top of buildings to attack other survivors . These impulse nades don't actually effect the survivors , doesn't move them when thrown at them . Zombies respawn as well, and are NOT effected by the storm ( don't take damage ). 

- storm moves the same way as a normal BR game . Except when the circle is about the size of fatal fields , ( just using ad size comparison ) the storm completely stops . this way there is an endgame with a timer allowing survivors to win . 

- loot spawns the same as usual. Building materials drop x5.  shields , heals , everything the same .

I for one think all the new changes have been great.  And they show Epic isnt just catering to the 1% like most fps type games do.  And just for believeing that im going to get downvoted.....

I’ve played 677 solo matches and put over 70 hours in that mode alone but it’s literally impossible for me to get a win, I’ve come in the top 10 53 times and 109 times in top 25, I’ve read posts and discussions on how to win and have pretty much successfully implemented all the tips people have to offer. I’ve familiarised myself with the building mechanics and I can build pretty well during a fight but I just seem to get sandwiched by people. It really tilts me whenever I lose and I just don’t have fun playing the game anymore. I’m surprised when people say they got their first victory in around 100 games. I’ve died in 1v1s around 25-30 times. In some situations someone grabs a weapon before me and I stand no chance and sometimes I kill 6-7 players in 5 mins but lose in top 5s. Please help.

Seems to be an action to either get to cover or get a clear shot (like moving out of cover), but it's a really shitty thing I can't seem to stop. I could be out in the middle of a field, aiming a sniper at someone, and my character will start moving left. Worse yet I'll be just poking out of cover to ambush a door or something, and I won't be able to do it because my character pulls left behind cover.

Thankfully it's inconsistent, but I'd say I experience it in at least 50% of the matches I play.

Anybody know if this is a bug or a feature? If it's a feature, where do I go to turn it off?",FortNiteBR

It's also kinda annoying when you can't hit someone because you shot the part of a wall that hasn't been constructed yet and they are behind but your bullets just collide with the invisible wall protecting them completely.

I feel like the building would be a lot more strategic if you could shoot through the gaps while its building because I feel like people rely more on building than actually being able to aim.

I started playing on xbox around 3-4 months ago. When I started playing, most people I ran into couldn't even build. You'd start shooting them and they would just jump around trying not to die. The average player could maybe build a 1x1 slowly.

Now, it's a whole different story. The average player panic builds. I get into at least one build fight per game where someone takes the high ground on me. I regularly get one-pumped because people are good at aiming at the head (even on console). I only see clueless players (you know, the ones that look like they can't press the buttons) maybe once every 3-4 games.

Overall I think it's healthy for the game, but I just find it crazy. In my teen years I had so much time to play and was borderline elite at whatever game I wanted to play (mostly CoD). Now I'm graduating uni and even though I'm a good builder with a decent shot, I feel so... painfully average at this game.

That is the introduction or rather, re-introduction of the X and Y sensitivity “notches”. I believe originally that Epic Games implemented the function of being able to edit your X and Y sensitivity on your control by “notches” which in turn would change your sensitivity little by little to give you the perfect touch you wanted. 

But, ever since the Season 2 update (I think) they removed this function. So if you try to do it at the moment, you can move it by little “notches” (using your D-Pad for best results), but as soon as you hit Apply and back out the settings menu, it reverts back to what it was once set to, rendering it non-functional. So my solution, or suggestion is to put this addition back into the game or have the X and Y controller sensitivity set similar to how the Mouse sensitivity is for PC players, by decimals. 

At the current moment the X and Y sensitivity are set to numbers from 1-10 and you really can’t choose 6.5 or 8.9. Also, just to clarify in case any confusion to what I said about the decimals I’m saying that BOTH the X and Y sensitivities should have their separate section for their sensitivity not as in both are combined. Here’s a video clip as to what I am talking about: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZ2JrfzaB8",FortNiteBR

This is based on 3.5 mechanics. 

1)Det Charges
   -No real utility that Grenades, Rockets, or Grenade launchers don’t already provide

2)Silenced SMG
   -I’ve been playing since before Halloween and everyone I know across the vast discord channels, reddit, and in-game friends despise the Silenced SMG. The tac smgs are perfect we don’t need a silenced version. 

*Quick Explanation for reducing rarities of certain weapons* If everyone is leaving Blue burst and any rarity Deagle for a green AR and a Green hunting rifle there’s no reason to have these in the game. It pollutes the game with weapons that won’t even be picked up. 
   

3)White &amp; Green Burst ARs for sure ; possibly burst altogether. 

4)Deagle altogether


Why add more weapons when the game doesn’t even function properly with the weapons we started with. Let’s just fix the game entirely before we add anything else. 

Bolt Action delay has brutally reduced any inclusion to my inventory  when passing by and the guided rocket was a great concept but with the building portion of the game not running smoothly there was no full proof counter. Guided rocket is the easiest thing to defend against if the building worked. 

We just need more work on the mechanics and gameplay before anymore features or weapons are added. 

Please.
Please.
Please consider game mechanics over any future additions.

This can make skilled players that cant afford v-bucks spend more time in the game, and encourage them to keep playing. 25 v-bucks isn’t too much as you need 8 wins to buy something in the store (and winning is not easy!), and to buy a new skin you would need 80 victories!

In any other shooter game this would be considered a bug, a HUGE bug which any developer would want fixed immediately, so why in this case have Epic decided to add bloom on the assault rifles as a feature? Imagine hitting a clean shot with a sniper and just watching the bullet whizz to the right of the player. Which gets me thinking is the shotgun bugged when you hit someone for 7, 9 or whatever low number hp you hit them for or is that just intentional bloom aswell?

I just don't understand how you can have a shooter game in which you're not guaranteed a hitmarker when your crosshair is directly on the enemy(excluding bullet drops with particular games/guns). It's literally down to the flip of a coin whether your bullets hit them or not. It's the equivalent of being on a racing game and having a 50/50 chance of your car pulling away on the grid once the race starts or starting a game of fifa and not knowing whether your full starting 11 are going to be on the pitch or not at the beginning of the game.

I have bought both battle passes along the way and several of the non-battlepass skins also. 


Having said that, I feel as if the battlepass makes the game a chore. Having to worry about daily quests every day (or 3 every 3rd day) in addition to the weekly quests (sure, they take like 2 hours) has become a chore. I earned John Wick this season but was not able to get the Black Knight last season because I apparently did not play enough. Having a wife, full time career, etc, the last thing I need is the thought of ""shit, gotta log on tonight/this week to make sure I can still get John Wick at the end of the season"". I am going back to wanting to play how I want to play, when I want to play (like I did before the battlepass). I will continue to buy skins and support the game/developers through other avenues!

TLDR; Battlepass makes this game feel more like a chore and is taking away some of the fun for me.

Today I was surprised by the people finishing enemies in the middle of a fight. It has happened every time me or my teammate goes down. It's a meta that ruins and makes the duo/squad modes boring.

Since I doubt that any of you even like when people finish since I see a lot of people on here hating on people that do that I came up with an idea.

Why not add an extra 100 shield that can only be activated when enemies are shooting at you and when you are down? It will make it harder to finish in the middle of an fight and it just makes everything more fair. Less solos in finals and just more fun in general.

https://i.gyazo.com/492b2aab9cd2675e627c77ae6a0fbc0f.mp4
That is an example of that happening and the reason why the resolution is so small is because I do not want any names included.

Here is my suggestion on how it should work with the extra shield.
https://i.imgur.com/OUdkrVp.jpg
It's like normal shield that you get from drinking them, another idea can be that your shield from before you got killed applies to when you are down but does not apply if you are revived again.
Also the transparency is there to show the user that the shield isn't protecting all of your health.

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

-they do too much damage. A player should not be rewarded for cowardly spamming with rpgs in a fight. they should be something you hold for large area dmg and building destruction. lets face it, they take 0 skill to use u just point click and hope you dont shoot a wall right beside you. I suggest, base damage be lowered and damage is also lowered depending on your proximity to the explosion that way they can't spam it no matter where you are and do 110 dmg while you're praying for your pump to hit something.
-Rocket capping. this is something i doubt anyone would like but rockets are way to easy to acquire from ammo crates and random spawns and i think there should be a cap on how many a player should be able to hold. Each player should not be able to hold lets say more than 15 or 20 rockets because the amount of games where I end up losing to a 0 kill guy who got hill in the zone and has 50 rockets to unleash on me is higher than i would like it to be.

A lot of us do realize this is a free game and the amount of polish on this already makes a lot of AAA titles pale in comparison - the new console control scheme update, the weapons balancing - all just excellent work and in great speed too.  

People (especially on this sub) seem to have gotten spoiled and are now constantly using the ""fix it my way or I QUIT"" rhetoric but the truth is they won't find another game that even holds a candle to this game's quality, let alone the fact that this whole ""building"" thing is paving whole new ground and obviously will take some development time to work out all the kinks!  

They can whine about how the weapons swap or aim mechanics makes the game ""literally unplayable"" but I don't see anyone whining to Activision or Infinity Ward to completely overhaul Call of Duty's aiming mechanics on a weekly basis.

However it can be clunky at times when trying to speed build having to press the button twice if you are only trying to build one piece. (clicking twice to build one set of stairs then twice to go back to walls) The only time you actually have to see where you are placing a piece is on the first placement. (example: falling off a cliff and using the floor to judge how far you've fallen)

Problem: The current builder pro model is the equivalent of PC players having to press each key twice when switching back and forth, and would be much better with 1-click placements.

Example: Double ramps + walls in front is not possible with builder pro having to go back and forth, something PC players can do easily with some practice.

Solution: Add a setting to enable 1-click building for Builder Pro so that I can build 2 walls + stairs in 3 buttons instead of 4. I know it sounds like it would not matter but it would make all the difference when in a build fight where you need to be 100% accurate and constantly going back and forth between pieces. Not only this, but it would make building on console much more crisp and enjoyable to watch.

Additionally: Ideally I think this work best if 1-click building started after your first placement of build mode, so that you could still select a floor tile without placing it when sliding down a cliff, but every piece after that would be 1-click. 1-click building would reset every time you entered/exited build mode.",FortNiteBR

I just don't understand how this could possibly work without private matchmaking.

http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/ps4/fortnite/ladder/singles-global/standings

**edit**: nvm. I found the rules. In case anyone is interested:

**Hosting:**

**1v1 Matches:**

The hosting team should invite their opponent to a Duos game lobby.

**2v2 Matches:**

The hosting team should invite their opponent to a Squad game lobby.

Once together matchmaking within the correct region should begin.

**How to play:**

A standard Battle Royale round shall be played per map.

The team which ends the Battle Royale round with the most kills shall win the map.

Kills made after a match has concluded will not count. 
A match is considerd concluded once all players from both teams have died.
Example: Players A,B, and C are all dead. Player D is still standing. If Player A gets a kill, that kill will count towards the team's overall score. The second that player D dies, no other kills that occur after Player D's death will be counted.
Tie Game:

In the event of a tie, the team which remained alive the longest shall win the map.

If both teams survive to the end of the round, the team who achieved the final kill shall win the map.

**Team Killing:**

Teams are permitted to work togther, however, you may not intentionally cause the death of your opponent. This includes sabotaging structures, causing fall damage, or any other negative interference in your opponents gameplay. Doing so will result in a forfeit of the map.

Video proof must be provided which clearly shows any of the above as well as all Gamertags.

**Disconnections:**

In the event of a disconnect, the kills at the point of disconnect shall stand. The disconnect time shall be counted as time of death.

**Proof Requirements:**

All teams should provide video proof of the following:

Team Kills

Opponent Kills

Opponent time of death

**edit 2:**

So I guess it's not really a true 1v1 or 2v2 (ie kill each other, whoever survives wins.) It's just whoever has the most kills at the end of the game is considered the victor. Would love to see private matchmaking so we can so who the best of the best of the players out there.",FortNiteBR

So feel free to chime in and tell me why I am wrong, or maybe you support my position?

So lets start this off. I think that Battle Royale is just a game mode for any (pretty much any) FPS game and nothing more. It is not it's own genre and is not much different than other, regular FPS. I think this will become even more clear, as we will see it added to other FPS games coming out. Battleflied or Call of Duty Battle Royale anyone? Furthermore I think that other modes, like objective based modes present in Overwatch (Assault) or back in Return to Castle Wolfenstein (Stopwatch), are more ""complicated"" and more different from the standard Deathmatch mode than Battle Royale.

I think that Battle Royale has two main flaws as a game mode, which have not been addressed by any game yet on the market.

The ratio of looting to shooting: I think that necessary setup phase is rather long compared to the interesting action phase. So you spend a lot of time scouring for loot and less time plotting you course into the zone and fighting other people. This ratio is really bad in PUBG. It is better in Fortnite, but I am still waiting for someone to design it in a way, where this ratio is really favorable to the action part. Maybe we can get rid of the looting altogether and start with the action

Hiding is a viable option: Although we are conditioned by the streamers, who made this game mode as popular as it is today, to believe, that the correct way to play is to run out shoot everyone in sight, it is not. I challenge you to just hide in a spot and only move when need because of the circle. When moving try to avoid any contact and stay hidden. You will be surprised how efficient this and maybe will make you question the often used play styles. Battle Royale played this way also gets boring after a few matches.

That spot being, how do you decrease the skill gap since match making will no longer separate the gaps of the players. This is how games function. 

Either you get SBMM and then you can balance so that the skill gap is allowed to increase and then you mostly get people of similar skill playing against each other and those balances aren't as noticeable on a wide scale.

OR

You don't get SBMM and then you have the need to attempt to balance the game so that the game isn't ruined for lower skilled players constantly being matched up against anyone. 

Same could also be said of the current peeking issues, and while we have one post from an EPIC employee saying that ""It looks like a bug"" it hasn't really shown up anywhere else. I would say that until we get a 100% yeah this is a bug, we can add this to another balancing issue put in place for the same reasons.

They have alot of big issues on their plate and the community will be eagerly awaiting to see how they respond to ALL of them. Some of these issues include:

* Dick Bullets (having to overpeak your structure so your shot clears)
* Weapon Swap Delay (This includes swapping from building mode)
* Weapon Shot Delay (Your gun finally arrives but won't shoot)
* Phantom Floors (If someone dies on a floor piece you fall through it)
* Shotgun Damage Inconsistency (Point blank 7-12 dmg)
* etc (basically anything added recently that SLOWS down the pace of play)

I feel like in this games core, it is supposed to be fast paced and adrenaline inducing. In the past few updates, the pace of play has been slowed due to, but not limited to the above issues. I don't know how I feel about 1st shot accuracy, but if there were ever a game that bloom worked with, it was this one.

At one point, this game was unique because the better shooter could be outplayed by the better builder. It can still be the case, but not as much right now. I always thought of this game as a positioning/repositioning game more than a shooter. I know Epic is trying to do great things right now, but sometimes less is more. Impulses were one of the greatest additions to any game, EVER. I feel like the addition of those fit perfectly into the flow and style of game that Fortnite is. Port-a-fort and guided missiles, not so much. It takes absolutely zero skill or practice to use either and they both slow the game down.

All that said, I will restate my original thought. This is a BIG week for you Epic. I know everything can't be fixed in a week, but there are alot of eyes on you right now wondering what direction this game is going to take. If you can't fix it all with the update, you should really try to fix some of it with an official statement.

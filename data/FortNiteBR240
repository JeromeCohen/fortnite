**Closing notes**: this is likely the last update I'll post. These take too much effort for too little gain. I've been doing these updates for nearly 2 months and the list is only getting longer. Custom bindings were confirmed some 3 months ago in an official State of Development, with the message that new info would become available once tested; nothing has been posted on the topic since. Customizing the order of the blueprints was mentioned to be on the minds of the development team 5 months ago; nothing on the topic since. It was mentioned that crouching while building was deemed important in the development of the controller scheme now known as Builder Pro, 6 months ago; this is still not possible, despite some obvious solutions. Dead zone configuration and seperate building sensitivity has been confirmed to be on the development list for nearly 3 months; again, nothing since. This is not to bash Epic Games, but rather a reality check. Also, this is not limited to console play. Remember shooting test #2? That was 4-6 months ago \[[link1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/86base/epic_too_much_silence_about_the_shooting_test_say/dw4o7w8)\], \[[link2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/86base/epic_too_much_silence_about_the_shooting_test_say/dw4tzc0/)\]. Info on KB+M on console being matched against other KB+M players will drop this week (likely tomorrow?). Let's hope some other long standing issues and confirmed/ promised features are disccussed.",FortNiteBR

It could be actually useful if they make the bloom smaller, for example like of s tactical one when you run and jump.

It could do 34 with the same effect, you can take down 100 hp with 3 body shots instead of 4, or 1 headshot 1 body shot instead of 1 headshot 2 body shots. This gap is even more noticeable when the enemy has 200hp. When most people you fight have 100/150/200 hp the FAMAS compared to just a grey burst doesn’t feel much different, it takes the same amount of shots to kill even 200hp (7 body shots for any burst rifle). In the least I feel like taking damage drop off would give it more of a purpose. If not giving the burst that crucial buff from 33 to 34 damage, giving it a 2.25x headshot could be reasonable. Hell I’d even take a gold FAMAS if it did 30 or even a few less damage with a 2.5x headshot. The gun feels outshined now especially with first shot accuracy which helped the scar more than the FAMAS.

[Long post, Question, and Rant]","**TL;DR** I'm really trying here, guys. I want to enjoy this game, I play it a lot, and with no other decent games out right now it's really the only thing to play. What is fun about it? When do I get to start enjoying the game? I constantly see posts on here that make the game seem fun and make me want to play, but I am only met by frustration and disappointment in the actual game.

I need to understand. Why do people like Fortnite? I can't quite understand it. I've been playing this game since Day 1, and I've been on &amp; off of it a few times, but now, all I feel when I play this game is frustration. When I look at this game what I see is:

- Constant nerfs/buffs (whether direct like the health adjustments, or indirect like the P90) to building due to the devs inability to simply make up their mind about whether building should be to sole factor in determining who wins a fight

- A constant inconsistency in game mechanics that just make me frustrated. The amount of times I die in this game due to some bullshit (that was entirely out of my control) just makes me close the game angry.

- A large amount of bugs/fps lag that just makes the game unplayable at times. We've seen videos all over this reddit, so everyone should no exactly what this is. I personally play on PC, a 1500+ gaming PC on medium graphic settings. I should not be getting FPS lag every game.

-A console game that always get the short end of this stick with every update. Even though i rarely play console, I'm curious on how console players have been able to enjoy this game recently. Looking at the videos on reddit, and hearing from friends that play it on console, the game just seems unplayable at times.

- A boring SPAM! meta that changes every week (but doesn't get any less boring) due to the dev intuition that nothing should be able to counter bullet spam.

-The huge gap is skill between players on PC. Which is a pretty interesting problem to have for a game with such a large player base. I would call myself an average play, I can hold my own but still get stomped on by others. The problem I see with this game is I almost never learn anything from my mistakes. When I die, it's usually by someone way above my skill level. The problem is I never actually say to myself, ""Hey, I know what I did wrong in that fight, I'll try to make sure I don't do that again."" like in other games. When I die in other games it will be to someone near me skill level so I can actually understand why I died and perfect my strategy. In this game, I usually die because I fight people that can build the entirety of Hogwarts castle around themselves in a matter of milliseconds, and that's usually followed by an incredibly lucky headshot on me. I don't learn anything from that. ""Ok, I need to get better at building."" HOW?? IN WHAT WAYS?? I didn't learn anything from that. [This is why I was actually excited when I heard they were working on a competitive mode, so I could actually face people at my skill level, but it never got released.] I've bought better hardware, remapped all my buttons, practice in playgrounds, but I still don't get any better at the game, nor learn from my mistakes after 700+ solo games.

- A boring solo game mode. The solo gamemode needs work. The fact that there are almost always less than 30 players left by the time the first circle even starts closing in, it creates so really slow and boring gameplay. That on top of every single person camping, is just entirely boring.

-  [RANT] Boring game mechanics that are constantly praised by the Fortnite community, and a demanded to be untouched. Building doesn't take skill. It's that simple of a statement. It doesn't. There's is little to no effort, or skill, required to spam a button over, so why should it be the biggest factor in determining the winner? ""Oh no, this person broke my wall, I better spam one button over and over until I win the fight."" ""On no, I accidentally placed the ramp before the wall! Its fine tho, because this game rewards me for making mistakes and allows me to build through my structure"" There's just no skill in it. Yet, I never see it being addressed as all people do is defend it. People constantly say the P90 is a ""no skill gun"" (which it is) due to it's spam. What's the difference between spamming a button to build a wall, and spamming a button to shoot a gun? Other than the fact that people will defend ""building takes skill"" with their life, absolutely nothing. One can't take skill, and the other not. Have you ever seen a build fight? There is no strategy involved, literally just whoever spams the fastest wins. I'll end this with an example from another game. In Overwatch, Mercy is known as the ""no skill hero"" because her main function is to spam one button to heal her teammates and win the game, why is that considered ""no skill"", but spamming one button to build and win the game is considered skill in this game? Its the same mechanic.

These are just the things I can think of off the top of my head.

I'm really trying here, guys. I want to enjoy this game, I play it a lot, and with no other decent games out right now it's really the only thing to play. What is fun about it? When do I get to start enjoying the game?

Since I've made my last post here, which was essentially me crying about having no idea what to do, I'd like to think I improved a little. I found a partner to duo/playground with, so I've been able to practice building, and I just had that feeling that I've gotten more comfortable with the game. I'm used to my keybinds, I can move around comfortably, and hell, I even thought my aim was getting better.

At first, I was confused as to why it wasn't translating in my regular games, seemingly at all. I noticed the same pattern. If I don't land with anybody, the game essentially becomes a solo lootfest for a good 20 minutes until I run into somebody and end up dying, whether or not I have a chance to try and build beforehand. If I do land with others, chance are I'll die in a fight, and if I do end up getting killed, I sure know that I've taken plenty of shots that I really just don't need to.

Today I was a little fed up with it. I knew something was wrong, and despite my attempts to learn from streams, I realized that my brain just isn't processing it for whatever reason. So I experimented a little and landed in extremely populated areas about 20 times, we'll say. This included tilted at points, but mostly just first stops from the bus, which was usually Pleasant, Greasy, Risky, etc. I figured that it'd stop me from getting in games where I'd start autopiloting because I'd landed alone in a city, or something along those lines.

The results were disastrous. It may seem like I'm exaggerating, but I did not last ten seconds after landing in all of these attempts. My conclusion is that it really seems completely random as to whether or not you'll thrive when landing in these populated areas. Obviously, this was even more frustrating, and I'm coming back here on sort of a last resort, because I don't really know what to do, again. And yes, it's probably my mind going around in circles again, but my frustration level is urging me to find a solution, maybe desperately so.

I've taken a little time to think about it. If I had to guess, I think it's something wrong with my early game capabilities. I'm self-aware enough to know that it's not actually random, that I'm clearly doing something wrong. But honestly, I'm not even necessarily talking about the experiment I tried above. I think my early game in general is just really lackluster. I find that these are where a lot of the skirmishes happen, and even though I build in every fight, I can't seem to take anything I did in playground mode and emulate that. Is there something I'm missing? A fundamental mistake, really? I just...I feel like I should be improving by now. And I know it's wrong to base progress off something like a stat, but the bagels are really, really jarring.",FortNiteBR

It really is over the top, this weekend I would've easily played against over 100 people supposedly streaming. I would put a massive bet at most 1 or 2 them actually being popular (I play on Oceania). 

Typically on squads I won't kill a knocked player straight away, I will shoot them twice hopping they start screaming at their team mate causing them to second guess what to do. However, every 4th player has streamer mode on now and I highly doubt every single one I see has at least 10 concurrent viewers that they may need streamer mode. You can't even acknowledge players abilities anymore if they out play you because you don't know their name.

So I'm calling upon all people who don't stream or stream but aren't up them selfs they need this function, to straight eliminate streamer mode players it's getting out of hand why even have an ID anymore.",FortNiteBR

To preface this I have read the polygon article and I’ve seen almost every time he has stated anything about this in past streams but I saw a video today and in this video he talks about the issue again.

He says this one line about not wanting to have this clip of a flirt or giggle or whatever and then have his wife see that clip and question him about it. This gave me an interesting thought that I couldn’t not tell someone. If his marriage is that fragile that his wife would constantly question him if she saw a short clip or anything that minuscule, then how come they’re together and so “happy”. I know I’m not them and they might be happily in love. I hate questioning their marriage because I’m nobody but with all his logic, if you marriage isn’t stable enough to handle stupid online shit then why still be with someone like that. Like if it’s stable and you too are in love and nothing can break you (wish is what we see) then why not play with female streamers? It’s the internet you can’t do anything without backlash or heat. You can see that from anything he does.

No chance in breaking down buildings compared to ARs and SMGs, It does less damage and shoots 3 bullets at once instead of AR doing more and only shooting one.

WTH yall talking about? most of my friends quitting fortnite and no one wants to play, because how boring it is to farm mats. I’m asking them everyday to play, and they all say they spend most of time  farming mats and they lose all of it from the first encounter, and then they would have to start farming all over again. most of them are playing rainbow six siege and the cod beta now. 

I really don’t think mats nerf catering to the casuals at all. none of casual players spend 3-5 mins farming and they end up dying, because they don’t have any mats to defend themselves. I think its more catering to the competitive scene because they don’t want players to turtle. Even watching the Summer skirmish is so boring, cause all they do is farm mats. If mats were easier to gain they would probably engage in more fights and not be afraid of losing their mats, cause they can get more quickly. 

Heres couple of suggestions they could choose from
1- buff mats so it matches 50vs50 
2 - add a potion that is like an energy drink that makes you farm faster
3- buff mats stacks from 20 to 60 

If you disagree, please tell me how farming mats  and losing it all to a LMG or SMGS is fun for you? 

Blitz is one of them most fun modes in the game, because how easy it is to farm. 

if you have any other suggestion, please let me know

Thank you Epic. Most Nintendo systems domt get many popylar FPS that I have enjoyed. Now I'm sure this is due to the huge user base, and insane popularity of the Switch. That being said, if you want to keep a good majority of us around, you GOTTA give us some attention.  
  
  
  
  
1) **We still cant track our stats**, and dont even know if you guys are so something will be retroactive if it ever does come out... Maybe give us a ""hey we are working on it"" at least...  Most other issues can be explained away with ""Switch doesnt have the specs"", but this is not the case here.
  
  
  
2) 80% of the time I drop, geometry is just blobs for 5-30 seconds, which means missed loot, and deaths.  
  
  
  
3) Inventory items don't show half the time. This may be a new big with 5+ patches, but is very difficult to work with. You see color and ammo, but no image.  
  
  
  
4) Lag, frame drops, all the time. I use a hard line connection so its not network. Ask buddies I'm teamed with on PC and XB and they dont see what I see.. Which is full seconds of lag. Sometime I just walk around a corner, and get one pumped by someone I dont even see for another full second.. Sure I suck but would like to at least see a line of sight on someone that kills me.  
  
  
Rant over, sorry for the outburst, but I love the Switch, Fortnite, and this community. I have a mortage and 2 kids so cant afford $700+ for a new PC anytime soon... Wish i could.. Anyway if it keeps trending this way I can see at least myself and a good chunk of others losing momentum and interest.  ",FortNiteBR

I'm a season 1 player even though i don't have the ''Rare skins'' that are being hyped for no reason ( Due to the fact that I didn't want to spend money on the game back then) I have never in the course of 5 seasons seen this game in such a horrible state. I went from having around 10-30 hours a week to none. You might wonder, why? Well simply because there is no skill gap whatsoever.   
Noobies spraying you down, drum gun being better than a legendary scar, shotguns being useless. But what really pisses me off is Epic Games claiming they want to make Fortnite an Esport. Looking away from the fact that the game is heavily based around luck, they completely removed the skill gap. They are favoring the children now, but what happens when they leave? They'll move along to the next popular game like they always do. But by that time, the rest of the player base will already be dead due to the fact that they choose to be greedy. I don't blame them for wanting to make money, they are a business it obviously makes sense, but to just spit on your long time players in order to earn an extra off of kids who steal their parents credit card is a bit over the line.  


I remember the first time I downloaded the game, it was on my ps4, and I had my friend over with his Ps4 over at my place. We stayed up until 4 am in the morning until we got the win, we played the whole day, but even though we kept dying and dying, we had fun. But now? All that fun is gone, because it doesn't encourage you to get better at the game, no, it encourages you to use the same tactic every game until you are the last one standing, just spray and pray.   


At the moment, I don't see the point in playing this game, I see absolutely no fun, and I'm just one of the hundreds if not thousands of players who left for the same exact reason. But if we as a playerbase stand up to Epic, and actually voice out our complains like we did before (Double shotguns etc) They might actually do something about this. Funny thing is, there were far more complaints about the double shotgun than there is about the state this game is in right now, which makes me really sad. Even though double pump was OP, atleast you needed skill to abuse it. So stop posting your ideas about LTM's and Skins and Guns because the game doesn't need that, it needs a big ass patch with fixes to guns such as the Drum Gun, the fucking smg's, maybe buffing building back up so a freshly built wall won't get 1 tapped by an AR (Yes 1 bullet will take out a freshly placed wall) And imo they should either revert the shotguns back to previous damage, or remove the 2 sec timer.

Idk though what do you guys think. 
My opinion is we deserve to be recognised and we should have our own console tournaments like pc does.

The burst assault rifle in fornite is not widely used as its fully automatic counterpart , the regular assault rifle . What I mean by the previous statement is that in most of my early game encounters , around 46% of the time they are using burst assault rifles . At around the 3rd circle, that statistic drops to around 32 - 27% of players using the burst assault rifles .  During the endgame, that drops to around 17 - 5% often at times 0, to explain  a bit more , when I refer to the endgame in fortnite , I am implying that it is somewhere around top 6 / top 7 . Another thought is that epic want new strategies for the game so maybe if the gun is buffed .

**The Statistics** 

The following table will list my opinions of what the damages of the burst assault rifles should be . 

||Common|Uncommon |Rare|Epic|Legendary|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Headshot|60|62|64|66|70|
|Bodyshot|30|31|32|33|35|

**Conclusion**

I think that this damage would be optimal and transform an under used weapon into a deadly assault rifle that , If you wait , can deal deadly damage . I think that this is fair because with the damage , I think that the fire rate  should be dropped from 2.3 rounds per second to 2.1 rounds per second to balance the weapon also to provide additional  balance , I think that the weapon could be quite noisy so that if shots are missed, the target can easily return fire.

I was one of the 30 people who made it to the finals, but this whole event felt like a huge scam. A lot of kids were waiting since 6 am in the morning, coming from far places. I'm already working on getting my refund so yeah.

The original post about this event is [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/96kk8b/i\_participated\_in\_the\_worst\_possible\_10000/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/96kk8b/i_participated_in_the_worst_possible_10000/)

This entire event was EXTREMELY unorganized, there were probably a good 700 people who participated &amp; signed up for this event. The event was suppose to start at 11:00 AM but it ended up starting around 2:00 PM, so they ended up rushing us for our matches giving us only 10 minutes to play a match. Which basically voided the 5 points you were given for a victory royale. (Although a few people including myself got a victory royale &amp; some of the workers allowed it to happen, while others urged us to get off the laptop even though we had less than 10 people in our game &amp; high elims)

Originally, on the event website we were promise custom matchmaking keys for the event &amp; 100 adequate PC's to play on. What they gave us were 30 old school laptops that could barely run the game past 30 FPS on the LOWEST settings. I swear I put all my settings to the lowest possible settings &amp; I would still get really bad frames drop. Not to mention, everyone was playing the game at like 100\~200 pings lmao. The custom matchmaking key basically wasn't even existent, they just told us to hop in a pub's match to see who could get the most elims. 

The prelims literally took 4-5 hours because they simply didn't have enough laptops to supply everyone who was waiting on line to play. The ENTIRE event was suppose to end at 5, but prelims ended somewhere around 5:30, so they ended up just completely skipping the semi finals &amp; going straight to the finals.

NOW this is where things really gets fucked up &amp; disorganized.

We were told we only had 5 MINUTES to play in the finals, they would track our elims after the 5 minutes, that by itself is absurd if we're playing in the finals we should be given an opportunity to play a full game, but fair enough. I decided to drop tilted to get as many kills as possible but sadly only ended up with 5. Due to the them wanting us to get out of the venue due to the event was suppose to end like an hour or two ago, they were rushing us to play. I saw some kid get his laptop slammed because they were telling us to close the laptops 30 seconds after the 5 minutes were over, but the kid was trying to explain to the worker he was trying to sign out his Epic Games account. 

Now you probably wanna know who won the entire event right? Well before I get to that, let me explain how they were keeping tabs on our eliminations. Many of the contenders in the finals would end their game so the workers couldn't see their elims &amp; just straight up lie about how many elims they would get. With the workers wanting to be home &amp; not being knowledgeable about Fortnite they wouldn't question it &amp; write down the score. This created A LOT of conflict between not only all the contenders but the contenders and the workers. The workers refused to look at the replay system to confirm how many kills each of the people in the finals got.

So you wanna know who ended up winning first place? A girl who played on a switch who told the workers she had \*\*30 ELIMINATIONS IN 5 MINUTES\*\*

So you can see how disorganized this entire shitty event is.",FortNiteBR

We as a family are staunch anti-vaxxers and believe in faith healing. I asked the school district if our church could pray for Billy's immune system as an alternative. They said no.

One of my wives had a great idea - what if we get a syringe full of water and have it blessed by god to protect Billy? We ran this idea by the superintendent, but our seed could find no purchase.

I finally had to hunker down and make a compromise. Billy has been in sports for his whole childhood, and I just hated the idea that he couldn't play just because of our holy covenant with the lord.

We went to the clinic as a family, many of my girls cheeks were wet with tears. It was very crowded in the waiting room, so I stepped outside for fresh air. I looked to the sky and prayed that my boy would be alright. Then all the sudden the sky grew dark, and I heard thunder off in the distance. The wind picked up and nearly blew my NASCAR cap off my head. I ran inside, knowing that god was telling me to stop the vaccine from happening. 

I was too late. Billy walked out of the office with a cotton ball taped to his arm.

We put billy under supervision for a couple of days and he seemed fine. One night I awoke to the sound of thunder again. It had to be another sign. I put on my slippers and investigated the noise. It wasn't coming from outside... it was coming from Billy's room. I slowly opened the door, and couldn't believe what I saw.

The thunder was gunfire coming from Billy's computer game ""FortNite"". He was screeching with joy, jumping around a pastel fantasy battlefield. I slowly backed away and shut his door. I woke one of my wives up and told her about what I saw. We both prayed and held eachother and sobbed all night.

Billy came home from school early the next day. This surprised me, because it was the first day of rugby practice. I asked him why he was home so early. He informed me the following:

""I don't really feel like it. I found this new show called Rick and Morty, and I think I wanna watch that instead""

I just stood there jaw dropped while he attempted to walk past me. I noticed he had something in his hand. Some kind of bottle. I lightly grabbed him by his arm, just to get his attention. I asked him what was in his hand.

It was a 16oz bottle of Mountain Dew. 

I lost my temper. He knew we only did milk or water in this house. 

Anyhow, he had some friends over that afternoon and they were doing some... interesting things in the living room. These weren't his normal friends from church. What I saw was pretty baffling. They would all stand there in front of the TV and do this strange dance. Their arms were straight, feet planted, and they'd swing their arms and hips side to side.

My eldest daughter told me it was called ""Flossing""

I've been very upset about all of this, and I don't know what to do. I just want my son back. Anybody have any dove approved advice for me? Thanks",FortNiteBR

They need to remove the cool down and switch delay with all shotguns and add damage now that SMGs are in the game as it makes the game feel so sluggish. There is no reason to have a cool down on shotguns and not SMGs. Also buff pistols and LMG/burst to make them useable cause they are irrelevant at this point. ",FortNiteBR

 1.Keep Inventory.
Make an option in the menu to toggle on and off keep inventory. There is nothing more annoying then if you’re in a huge battle with all your friends and 2 or 3 of you die in the same spot, and then all your stuff gets mixed up. Keep inventory would just be a little quality life improvement, and I don’t think it would be too hard to add to the game.

2.Some sort of a creative inventory.
I’m not sure how hard this would be to implement, but some sort of place to get an infinite number of materials, guns, and ammo from, would be great. Really I just want to not have to go searching for bounce pads for thirty minutes every game. :D

3. The ability to save our playgrounds.
This is the big one. There is nothing more frustrating then knowing you only have 3 more minutes before the storm comes in and you haven’t finished your project yet! Sure, we have replay mode to look back on what we built, so it’s not “gone” but it would be great to be able to save your playground, and revisit it another time to edit your creation. Maybe for this to work we would need “Playground” to be separate from BR (by this I mean like how Save the world is separate from BR, but they’re still both part of Fortnite). I’m not exactly sure how it would work but it would be cool.

Thanks for reading all the way through. Sorry for the wall of text :) these are the 3 big things that would make playground great in my opinion. I’d love to hear other ideas though!",FortNiteBR

The Drum Gun was reasonably balanced when it was introduced in Season 4. This was a little more viable than the Tac SMG, but it was still fine to use. The Drum Gun would do 5 shots (22 dmg to structures) to a wood wall to break it which was reasonable (since wood walls still spawned with 100 health respectively).


There was also no P-90 in the game at this time. The Drum Gun had a purpose of having a large magazine size of 50 but still viable since it was good at close range and wasn’t sluggish like the LMGs... great! 


Season 5 is where it messed with the balance of everything.


With the nerf to building, wood walls only now spawned with 80 health. This meant it was an automatic 4 shot from an AR and a 4 shot from the Drum Gun. This was when wood materials were at it’s weakest. This in addition to the broken P-90 was toxic.


This brings us to today with the current balances of the game. 


I finally think that the P-90 is a balanced gun for the most part and fits its purpose of having a large magazine size of 40 but still being good close quarters. The P-90 is doing everything that the Drum Gun should be doing as an SMG... having both is redundant. Ik the P-90 is more rare but it is definitely not far superior than the Drum Gun.


There’s also 4 types of SMGS in the game at the moment... 3 was fine since each one had its own little niche it excelled in. Silenced SMG and normal SMG are relatively balanced right now and the P-90 would earn its rarity since it would outperform the other SMGs.

For those of you who think that the Drum Gun must ABSOLUTELY stay, just remember that not even 7 weeks ago, there was no Drum Gun or P-90, and you were fine without it.


I know this post comes off as extremely negative but I really do think that we are close to having a balanced meta. Just need to fix Splodes, Farming Forever, and a few other issues. I actually don’t want the Drum Gun removed from the game! I loved when it was introduced but it is really defining the meta right now because of it’s value and for how good it can be. But I feel like it must go to help with the spray and pray meta.

What are your thoughts?

TL;DR - The removal of the Drum Gun would help with the spray meta and also have the P-90 serve the niche that the Drum Gun currently does. Having both is redundant.

Most people realize the importance of materials and how much it really sucks when you try to place a wall for cover and you're out of material. 

For this reason, many players (like me) land on the outskirts far away from others to farm up in order to feel secure with mats during any firefight. If the amount of mats per hit were increased, (like in Blitz!) that would make players like me land in more occupied places more often, making most games far more interesting and exciting. 

Of course turtling is a concern but it is not as bad or effective as it was a few months back. 

Another alternatives to buffing mats gained is to have eliminated players drop extra mats, or to have chests and loot drops provide random amounts of high material. 

I'd love to be able to get into fights comfortable without hitting trees for 10 minutes first.

I personally hate it, and think that it makes any sort of peeking out of a ramp/wall structure a lot less viable. I also think that in. The competitive scene this has led to even more turtling and campy builds/boxing and taking right peek shots now, since the right peek off of a build seems to offer a more favorable angle. 

Imo dying to or getting hit by the small percentage of the community taking advantage of the ghost peek was preferable to having such a jacked up camera angle, with so much of the character blocking field of view, and so much of your players body exposed before you can shoot past your ramp.

So below I've listed things I've encountered during making the switch for anyone who's thinking the same.

Pros

1) OMFG the frame rate is phenomenal and graphics also too.
2) games are soooo cheap on Steam. Just got PubG for £6.
3) I'm 32 years old and always felt like a large majority of the console community are children. So meeting adult gamers is so cool and most of them are respectable.
4) The modding opportunities are endless.
5) STW no longer crashes.
6) No more monthly subscriptions.
 
Cons

1) learning the mouse and keyboard is like learning from scratch, I'm hopeless with WASD.(tips anyone?)
2) Waving goodbye to my console friends.
3) My PC takes about 2-3 minutes to boot up.

All in all I LOVE my new gaming PC, I feel like a proper gamer now even if I can't get a kill. I told myself if console prices exceed £400 I'm switching to PC because why would I want a platform that I can't upgrade over time and for the same price I can get a PC.

I definitely recommend switching to PC if you have the ability, it's been so eye opening and wouldn't go back to console if you payed me. The biggest difference is easily the frame rate and graphics, after 3 days of playing I'm still shocked when I boot it up every morning.

Some games like Amnesia The Dark Descent (with texture filters Trilinear, Anisotropy settings x16, and bloom on), and the old 2007 game Sumotori Dreams (I'm pretty sure you've never heard about that game, but okay) works at about 60fps uncapped (however almost both games go in around 50-40fps, but that's fine).

The laptop type is Dell Latitude E6420.

Just gonna copy/paste his idea here.  
&gt;I had the idea that per storm shrink material gain from gathering could go up maybe 5% per new circle or something so that towards the end of the game the less you have time to farm the faster you can get the resources. I think something like this would work best so that early game isn’t just instantly loaded with mats. I really feel like a increase mat gain as the game progresses would possible make you spend less time getting loads of mats of the start and then have a huge advantage over other that have had to use their resources in build battles. Lmk your opinions I really think is could be a good way to fix the current mat problem or make it less of a problem",FortNiteBR

It can start slow, but quickly escalates into fight after fight. I believe that the fact that not one knows exactly where the storm is going deters people from playing around the storm (i.e camping at the edges of the next circle).

I'm sure not everyone would want this, but I'd like to see steady storm as a permanent game mode (much like how 50v50 has become). I'm not sure how this game would work for solos and duos (I can imagine they'd be worse), but for squads it works amazing.

Just a week ago, my friends and I have diverted our attention from Fortnite BR to play other games because we've just lost interest in the BR playstyle. But lo and behold, Steady Storm came out, and we've been having a blast playing it every time. I think that the slow storm that applies slow pressure is better because it makes all places a viable location. What I mean by this is that no matter where you drop, you'll always be able to run towards the center, wherever that may be. In normals, you could drop junk junction and have an unlucky circle that ends in paradise. You could drop 6 kills, but ultimately die to the storm. The storm in normals doesn't apply that constant pressure of always closing in and players can forget about getting to the next circle. 

With Steady Storm, the players can never be out paced and cheesed by the storm and can ALWAYS outrun it. I've yet to come across a scenario where I couldn't outrun the storm. Taking this cheese out of the game makes it very fun. As the circle gets smaller, there is, for reasons I can't think of, much more constant fighting. Without being able to know where storm is going, turtling and camping in buildings all of a sudden become highly discouraged. 

Maybe the problem isn't the building or SMG or what not. Maybe it's the way the storms work.

*TL;DR Steady Storm applies constant pressure and can no longer cheese people who drop at the outskirts. More skirmishes towards the end of the game. Storm discourages camping and encourages pushing and fighting others.*",FortNiteBR

I suggest a 5-10 second grace period between knock and finish. Maybe not a perfect recommendation but imo something should be done. ",FortNiteBR

In a previous stream, TSM_Daequan said that the devs need to interact more with the community. I agree with this statement. But, he said that Reddit ruined the game. While this may seem true to a degree, I feel like this statement neglects some facts. Please note: I am in no way an enemy of Daequan. I’m a two month subscriber to him.

Fact 1: Reddit can give a voice to the voiceless. 

Reddit can give the power to reach hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of minutes. With power like that, huge issues and current ones can be solved by typing a post and clicking post. That way, Epic Games developers can notice a problem and start working on a way to fix it. The reason they don’t seem to acknowledge the fact that some bugs exist, may be due to the fact that previous posts have been made, or after an update, they realize too late that problems have been created. So, they start working on a fix. While it would be nice to hear updates constantly, that may just be unable to happen. 

Fact 2: Reddit is a gold mine for finding game-breaking bugs and other things that even the developers might not have noticed. 

This subreddit gets posted to constantly. People find bugs and can post it here, and boom. It can be fixed fast, or slow. We just have to be patient. These bugs can be so game breaking and could go under the radar completely without being noticed, but thanks to Reddit, it can be shared and noticed. 

Counter-argument: Reddit bitches too much 

Sure. I can agree that a lot of people complain about things too much. So much so, that epic over fixes an issue because of the mass amounts of complaints. This can cause more issues and that’s why I think Daequan made this statement. This subreddit can be so powerful, it can make issues worse by complaining so much that Epic has no choice but to rush to fix the issue, causing more issues. This can be fixed as long as people can stop over posting an issue to the point where it seems like an issue that needs to be patched ASAP. For example, people that complain about more bugs that are caused after a patch need to realize that the only way it can be fixed properly is to calm down and wait for the issue to be fixed properly. 

I hope some of you can agree with what I had to say, and I would love to see some more discussion and criticisms about what I said in the comments. ",FortNiteBR

I've never hacked, scammed, bought an account, teamed in solo and I'm not ""too friendly with other players"". However, I feel like my fear is justified judging from all the people on the internet who claim that they've had their accounts banned for no reason. All you need to do is search it on YouTube and you'll find plenty of people who claim the same thing. Main reason I bring this up is because I came across a specific post from a good few months back on some forum website, and the guy who wrote it stated that he was banned for 'using VPN' after using his account on a different pc. This was probably some kind of auto ban feature which has been lifted by now but it weakens my trust for Epic especially since I'm planning on installing a new GPU and a new hdd/ssd. It makes me fear that if I install Fortnite on a fresh hard drive I'll be banned for no reason knowing my luck. Call me paranoid as hell but I really don't want to lose my time and investments on this game just because I wanted to upgrade my PC. Someone please reassure me :(",FortNiteBR

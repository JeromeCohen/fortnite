I didn't ask for a nerf, I got better and learned it. When I was new, I had to build when I got shot, not throw a grenade and boom high ground is mine. I hated the pump but always seemed to die by it, then I put around 50 games dedicated to just learning it. Now you've nerfed it to the max, it's not even usable now. You've even nerfed quick farming, farming is boring and takes time while you're running from haunted to damn moisty. There was no need, no need to reduce the skill gap THIS much, bloom is there for that. 


We know you want to give everyone an equal chance at the game, but what makes a game good is playing it so much you find yourself progressing. My friend joined when the port-a-fort came out, he plays around 20 matches a day and still hasn't learned how to build. Always depends on finding some port a forts and doing it the lazy way, he's been killed countless times but he still thinks it's op and building suk. Smh epic, calm down on the nerfs.",FortNiteBR

A character has to pull an object that crashed down from space out of a crater or divot  and he is the only one that can pull it out. This explains both what was inside the comet, why there is a huge lab there now (just like in the movie) and this links to the theme of the new season. I tried to use the explicit words but my post got moderated because of some dumb people on this sub. I feel like this theory needs some attention though because it could be legit.

We at epic games knew that the price was too high for a cosmetic at the time, especially since the game wasn't very popular. However we at epic games had created a formula for the most popular game in the world and started implementing it piece by piece. Once the marketing rolled out and we organized with streamers to promote the game we would soon take over the video game industry. Fast forward 6 months and we have what's called the skull trooper effect. The psychiatrists at epic games say that the skull trooper effect is caused by lack of affection from parents from young childhood to early adult hood. Basically we released the normalest skin ever, not special at all. And we made it rare on purpose to see how the future massive community would react to it. The results are shocking. Normal people who've had affection from parents don't really value the skin. However those who weren't shown any love, they want the skin very very badly. They crave it. Drool for it. They won't think twice about dishing out 3 or 4 digits of cash to obtain it. Then theres the broke ones who haven't gotten any love from parents either. They want the skin to be released again, because they don't have the money to buy it from any fishy Twitter fortnite account.

The fact is, skull trooper is just a normal skin. If it weren't og and special you wouldn't care for it. ",FortNiteBR

Not one player lept, for the loot in my hand;

I dashed to the chest with ease and with care,

In hopes that a scar and some shield would be there;

spectators watched, as I ran through the lobby,

With visions of killing all that went snobby;

But not a player was spotted, from near or afar,

As I stood patienly with my new golden scar;

When up from a mountain, there arose such a clatter,

I was shot in the head, but this was no matter;

I built, and I built, and I kept my morale,

Until I had won that battle royale;

The update had started, as I sat in my chair,

The new season was here! and the hype, I couldn't bare;

The game opened up, and a message arose,

""too many players, connection closed"".",FortNiteBR

This said, I am struggling to keep up against anyone who is alive longer than 5-6mins.

&gt;Whats the best way to go about building? Every time I press 'Q' it seems to go the wrong blueprint and I build a wall instead of stairs, or a floor for defense XD
&gt;Everyone around me seems to land faster so when I go into a built up area I have 2 shotguns aimed at me within a minute
&gt;I cannot find enough shield items. Half the battles I play I end up with 0 shield and headshotted from the top of a tower .....

Would appreciate a bit of know how if anyone has any.

The basics would be that we would all queue up at the same exact time, on the same exact server to accomplish something similar to the Wake Ceremonies. Every Thursday we‚Äôd have a different challenge/theme. For example, maybe totaling Wailing Woods, Building a Giant Skybase, Pickaxe Battles, the list goes on. We‚Äôd use the least populated server at that time and set a specific time for every Thursday (comment what times work for you so that we can all come to an agreement)

So, how can we get this movement going? First off, in order to gain some traction we‚Äôre obviously gonna need some upvotes. This is so that as much people as possible can view this original post so they know what‚Äôs going on and discuss what times work best for everyone on *Thursday*. Everything (rules, time, location, challenge/mission, etc.) will be organized via my Reddit, and will then be posted on my Twitter @xsqoof

Granted, there *will* be some trolls that will try to grief our events but that‚Äôs why the set rules will include a unique combination of outfits/backbling/glider/location so that we know who is taking part in the Queue Night event. Obviously, since we don‚Äôt have custom games as of yet, completing something like this is not possible without this idea. But once we *do* get custom games, things like this will obviously be a lot more organized.

before anyone says I‚Äôm ‚Äúdoing this for the views‚Äù I‚Äôd like to address that that‚Äôs not true. The reason I‚Äôm doing this is so that we all have something unique to experience just like we did with the Tilted Towers/Dusty Depot Wake Ceremonies. I received a ton of amazing support from that and a bunch of people were genuinely happy that we actually accomplished what we did without anything but a Reddit post. I thought that was pretty amazing. The TT Wale Ceremony also received a ton of positivity from tons of different gaming media sights such as [IGN](http://m.ign.com/articles/2018/04/19/fortnite-players-attempt-to-destroy-tilted-towers) and many more. There were tons of posts on Twitter, Instagram, and the front page of Reddit about it and I was genuinely shocked that we actually accomplished something so grand.

So please, if you do want to see this movement go somewhere and if you think it‚Äôd be a unique and fun experience, please help it gain traction and support from this amazing community. I genuinely believe we can do this. Because in the end, this isn‚Äôt just about me, it‚Äôs about the entire community and all the things we can accomplish for content and enjoyment.

Feel free to DM me on Reddit or Twitter (@xsqoof) with any further questions/concerns/input, it would all be *greatly* appreciated.

make sure to stay tuned for when these events take place as I‚Äôll be streaming them for those that can‚Äôt participate and want to watch. And this time, everything will me *much* more organized than the first time.

With some tweaks it could be a fun addition to the game. As in, it does zero damage to metal and brick structures. There‚Äôs a small circle on the ground 2 seconds before a meteor lands and the meteors only show up towards the last few circles.

I know I know, more rng usually sucks. But think of it as a sudden death mechanic other than seeing who can outheal the other person. It would also make the other materials much more viable towards endgame as brick and metal would be invincible. Or at least take many meteors to destroy.

But does fortnite has induced anger when you die?,"I like this game but take it so fucking seriously. Im only in the 7th and Im breaking and making dents in the wall over this game. When I die I get a strength of anger and induced rage and hit the walls. I take games so seriously. Here's a reason why. I never take breaks I go to the bathroom and get up and stuff. I die and rage over tiny shit. And when I die from a shotgun I get a quick feeling of anger and get mad. But here's the thing. I rage at bullshit or how I die. When I play pubg and die. I don't rage since im decent. But when I play fortnite I get mad at unrealism and shit. And damage. Since I real live put a dent in my wall in my room. Ripped the white things off my broken bed since it's standing. Other reasons. Im ADHD and black but not saying that's the reason. But I usually go insane when I lose. Like get killed and get hyper and run and jump insane. Yet I just want to be decent at the game to where Im not so fucking insane when I lose. My mom made it worst when I got mad. She didn't want to talk to me since her stomach hurts. She never wanted to acutally calmly talk to me why im angry. She just yelled at me when I got home and she never wanted to talk to me. I told her that Im like my brother since we both get mad at games. And she thought Im gonna be in prison with him. I real live have induced anger with this game. I mean look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVtK5B5t6g The way ninja got mad is how I go insane. I get mad when I die but here's the details. When I die. I smash both my fists on my drawer and hit the walls. Im worried that we might get evicted because of me. But my mom never wanted to communicate with me. I just want to acutally play the game without my induced anger with it. I do think it makes you violent or agressieve. Im not saying it's the game but how the game makes us feel. It's both us and the game. So how can I stop breaking stuff? It gets worst when I message people and say imma hurt myself or something and yet Im just angry I lost. But please people. I don't need comments saying you're just butthurt or shit like that. Im just concerned why I rage so hard when I lose and shit. Since shotguns, legendary skins, or people in skins just piss me off. I don't like it since fortnite has a p2w system. It's not p2w but here's how I see p2w. P2W in my term is when you put money on the game and you randomly start getting better. That's my term of p2w. I don't like it since default skins have to waste money to get a skin. But It makes me mad when. Someone told me to buy the battle pass to get more wins and to get good. I real live bought it for skins. And yet Im winning more squads but not duo and not getting close. After the 1st week of season 4. Im taking a break. This game will be the death of my fists. Hell my finger is bandaged because I cut myself from the game. NO people I didn't get a knife and get cut myself. Something had happened to where my skin was coming out since I probably must of got cut when ripping off the bed white sheets. I even bit the skin instead of getting a bandage. I take games so goddamn seriously. Yet when I take my ADHD medicine Im calm as ever. Post your comments and suggestions. Post your suggestions if fortnite gives you induced anger when you die.

     1.Remove weapon delay(I feel as if this delay renders the pump useless and the tactical worse than it already is,the point of having that fast swap was to help combine weapons together for burst damage and make two weak weapons more powerful like the pump tactical wasting an inventory slot to have that fast extra shot while trying to lead shots really raised the skill gap for me, double pump was a monster which even I think should go if they take this delay away because it makes sense that if you switch back you have to pump it, and epic games said the delays are misleading and they are by being longer than they look I have been in many situations where I had to pull out my pump and when I should be able to shoot I have to wait that extra second thus getting me killed so youre better off using an AR at close range if you don't carry an smg which defeats the purpose of a shotgun)
     2.Smg and AR fire rate increase(the ARs just need to fire faster that way you have a chance against a person with a shotgun fully pulled out like most shooters you can dodge the pellets and it will fire fast enough to outgun it, as for smgs they don't do enough damage for their slow fire rate when do you see a person actually run around with a suppressed smg late game? If you buff their damage they can be used as ARs but an increase to fire rate keeps their place as an smg and an easier time dealing with shotguns if they remove the delay)
     3. Perfect accuracy when aiming in turn for recoil (the current bloom system we have currently really doesn't cut it for me I understand the minigun always having it but as for smgs and ARs this would be better for them, for me an ar in this game does have the ability to outgun a sniper where the sniper should succeed if the rng is in the ARs favor which doesn't make sense to me adding recoil and perfect aiming accuracy would help both smgs and ARs in their effective range as well as make them less effective outside of that range it also adds the level of skill of learning to control recoil and tracking the smg outside of it's good range should be hard to control but with skill can take on a AR same argument for sniper vs AR) 
     4.Reduce damage on bolt action sniper to 90 but increase it 5 shots in a clip and give a 2.5 headshot multiplier(I don't care as much about this one but it to me you shouldn't have to reload after each shot when using the bolt action sniper and reducing its power doesn't make it overpowered after and increase to a 5 shot clip)
     Conclusion:This is my opinion and how the weapon system should be reworked to add a skill gap again and make the game feel better in general.",FortNiteBR

0. Don't wear a backpack  
  
1.  Hold either a consumable, or a grenade. Weapons do not allow you to bend over and look down while crouching, pickaxe sticks out. If you have no items, hold the blueprint and pencil for building as the next best thing (the blue paper will stick out a bit)  
  
2. Find a bush. Best bushes are on a slight slope and allow for better concealment. Steep slopes make your feet visible.  
  
3. Crouch in the bush and look down. Experiment with rotating and position yourself in different parts of the bush to remain invisible. It is best to face towards the slope so your head doesn't stick out. Note you will have very little vision of your surroundings. Don't look around too much, it exposes you. However, if you do decide to, note turning too quickly will make you stand up. Turn slowly.  
  
Tips to winning with bush camping:  
  
Land somewhere with decent loot so you can actually kill one of the last few guys and take their loot which will usually be enough since its late game. Alternatively, challenge yourself by going for no initial loot.  
  
If going for maximum bush-campage, start your bush-camp near the center. Avoid conflict at all costs and only move if necessary to avoid the storm and do so at the safest possible moment (consider waiting for the latest moment, or the earliest if you feel there will be more people later)  
  
Once late game rolls around, pick a good time to emerge from the bushes.  Doesn't always have to be a 1v1 situation, if for example there are 2 left but they are busy fighting each other it might be easier to just kill them both so the winner of their duel won't have time to loot and set up.  
  
You might find it easier to pass the time if you alt-tab and watch a movie while waiting in a bush, since if you get found you usually are dead anyways. Make sure to tab-back in to move from the storm.  
  
Note: I am not skilled at the game, I just want to share my bush-camping experiences.",FortNiteBR

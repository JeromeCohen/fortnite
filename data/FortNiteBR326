i am turning to reddit because i dont know what to do anymore. I tried deleting my EpicGames Account because i just dont play anymore and i keep getting spammed by Epic-Games E-Mails and it just bothers me, that data is with them.

I tried reaching out to them since there is / was no delete button in your account panel. They replied and asked me to verify my account and stuff which i did. Then i confirmed my deletion request and since then i do not get any answer e-mails anymore.

But the Spam E-Mails are still coming and i dont know what to do.

Anyone know what to do or experienced anything similar and found a solution?

So I'm a big fan of items like Pluggers boogie bombs and epically the new C4s and other things like that but at some point in the game I always have to drop them for a better gun or health/shields. There are almost no situations where I would take a special item over a 3rd gun or something that would keep me alive and a buff can help to those items but won't change the usage rate a whole lot. So my idea is to add a slot for things like portas, impulse, grenades, BB, Pluggers and C4s with some adjustments the the carry limit. This would give these items a way higher usage rate and would add another layer to the game. I was thinking it could be like halos armor abiltbites (or better example) where everyone you run into has that extra wrinkle in their game. This seems to be the only way to make items like this more viable and would make adding new ones possible without the worry of them not getting used and eventually vaulted. ",FortNiteBR

Am I just getting shafted by Epic somehow? I don't see how there's any possible way I can be 5 XP levels above a few of my friends and be the same battlepass tier. I may have missed *one* daily challenge since I've started because I took a break for a single day, but that shouldn't account for the 20+ battle pass points I'm behind...

It's kind of annoying me, honestly, because I have a decent bit more time invested and I'm pretty much the same battle pass level despite being a much higher XP level.

I don't understand Epic's thinking here. Matchmaking is exclusive, i.e. console to console unless a PC is involved, in which case the PS4 player then plays with other PC players. I think I can infer from this it's deemed unfair to bring a PC player into a PS4 player pool.

You can (and will) debate the advantage MKB provides on a PS4 vs controller, but I don't think that's in question, else they wouldn't separate players. Only exception is again when you're essentially opting in to the PC pool via playing with a PC user in party.

If I'm not mistaken, Xbox doesn't have to deal with this, and I'm looking for a similar experience.

Please tell me you don’t see how flawed this is. We absolutely need the previewed building piece. There are so many problems with one click building, besides accidental misclicks.

How would you rotate things? Pre edit things? These are essential to building. In a build fight I use rotated stairs or pre edited pyramids to get down safely, none of these would be possible with one click building.

Now, the biggest problem- you won’t 100% know where the building piece will place. Good luck falling off a cliff because you thought the floor would place below you, but it didn’t because you didn’t have a preview of where it would place. Building would legit be a guessing game if you didn’t have a preview of each piece.

Either way, you only have to double click the first time you build a certain piece, after that it’s all one click building like you want, simply because the preview is already there for you.",FortNiteBR

I bought a battle pass in season 2 and have been grinding ever since. The battle passes gives more V\-bucks than what you initially spent, so it seemed like a good deal. I kept buying these passes. This resulted in me having roughly 1500\-2000 V\-bucks. I can't remember the exact number. However when I logged into my account the other day, all my V\-bucks were gone and I gained about 10\-15 battle pass tiers \(which I didn't buy myself\).   


I decided to mail the epic games support staff, on which they responded with:  


*""Hello Stan,*  
*Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.*   
*Unfortunately, purchases of the Battle Pass or Battle Pass levels are not eligible for refunds.*  
*I apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you for your patience and understanding.""*   


I wanted to bring this to your attention and ask your opinion on this matter, did anyone else experience this as well?",FortNiteBR

I\`'m not asking EpicGames to remove it, but there's something wrong,  I'm not the only one that avoid Dusty Divot, I'm not the only one that somehow doesnt enjoy going there, its a place where I usually take a rock and go away. I believe a couple changes could and should improve that place! 

This is what I think:

* Geographically speaking, it's way too big!  
   * Either 2 things: Fortnite map is too small for that crater, or the crater is too big for the size of the map.
   * The crater is bigger than tilted tower, however, the center where we find 95&amp;#37; of the loot is exactly the size of the Prison.

* Waaaaay too 'risky' for what it has to offer. Its basically an empty big hole.
   * Again: its a hole!  Whoever is on the edge of the crater has a clean view of what is going on inside the crater and also around it by just taking a 1 second look, however, who is inside the crater always has the feeling that he is being watched by a sniper or anyone all the time. Of course he doesnt know where that guy/squad might be, because its a 360o hole like any other, but if you hear a shot, good look trying to find that little head somewhere on the edge. And if you do, now you have the feeling that theres a sniper on your back. You always have that feeling don't matter what.
   * One more time: Its a hole!  It means that whoever is inside it has the ground disadvantage against who is on the edge. But we are not talking about a small ground difference, its like a 10 floors disadvantage.  Now mix this problem with the problem above.

* No 'natural' cover.
   * Lets say those disadvantages that I've pointed are fine. There's still one problem, which is the lack of natural cover to make it 'easier' to try to leave the crater or even go inside the crater. All we have are a couple of trucks which do provide  small protection, but despite that only small rocks with no possibility to hide around one. 
   * No natural 'cover' also means that there are no objects around to make it harder to a guy on the top of the crater look for an enemy in the crater.  Take a look at Pleasant Park or even Fatal Fields / Anarchy, these places are big and OPEN field, but the abundance of objects/buildings make the whole difference and fun to land there.

* Its in the center of the map
   * Ok, so, this is not bad at all, but if we avoid going there, becomes an important place of the game that isnt being explored as it should. Its a consequence of the facts I have said. If you haven't notice, the first storm will always have Dusty Divot inside the safe zone or at least on the edge, basically because its \+\- on the center of the map. Its very uncommon  not happen in the first storm. So I ask you: 
      * While running to the safe zone, do you usually avoid going through it ? 
      * How many times did you decided to go inside the Divot when its on the safe zone?

I believe that most people share a discomfort with Dusty Divot too . I believe that adding more objects, more buildings and stuff, this place could be as popular as Pleasant and bring more people balance to the east side of the map. 

I hope this post gets some attention, love you \&lt;3 ",FortNiteBR

Many fortnite players will hop onto Fifa tomorrow due to the new mode and as there is currently not too much to do in fortnite.
This is unless Epic drop the playground LTM which would easily stop at least a quarter of the player base going to try the new Fifa mode.

The game mode was insanely fun, the most fun I've ever had in Fortnite. I never experienced any issues with people staying separate on the ground or in the sky, people were always fighting. People on the ground built up and commandeered sky bases, and people in sky bases dropped to the ground in a surprise attack from above.

My impression is the refund system is there to try and ease epics customer support, we all know it needs it.

Quite frankly the refund system should work for 24 hours max after buying an item, you know it's been accidentally bought straight away and 24 hours gives you a chance to use it in game.

Epic dont need to give us a refund system but they want to and quite frankly the way the community has reacted to it is disgusting. I've never seen such an entitled community and I'm somewhat embarrassed to be a part of it.",FortNiteBR

Place it down and it emits a chest sound with a little crackle every 10 seconds (1 indicator that it's a trap). Also if you look closely there will be a small C4 on the back of the chest. When the chest is opened it beeps 3 times in 1 second  (similar to and impulse grenade beep) and then explodes for 150 damage. Reason for high damage because the trap will be legendary rarity and also the warning signs should be obvious. ,FortNiteBR

If you're wondering why you can't compete in most games. You're really trying your best but you can't seem to get a victory royale. You're messaging good players asking them to help because you can't win. This message goes out to you.

Just keep playing... Blunt, I know. But you've got to understand that a lot of us ""good"" players have grew up on shooting games. A lot of us were gaming before you were born, or at least before you were old enough to know what a game was.

Most of us have been playing games like CoD for over 10 years now. We grew up on a mix of CoD, Halo and Battlefield. You won't get good overnight, and that sucks to hear, but you've got a much higher chance of making a living from gaming then any of us do.

So just keep bashing whatever game you're addicted to and eventually you'll become one of these unstoppable machines that you watch everyday, but it's going to take some time. ",FortNiteBR

I was never a random team killer though, I always killed my teammates with good reason, and I understand it was because of the abundant amount of random team killing and player reports that inevitably got it removed.

The whole point of having building involved is because it's a game of chess, you outbuild your opponent and you should win the game (obviously that is not always the case). But with the jetpack added, you have such an advantage over anyone. Even if you're a top tier builder, you can still just be destroyed because of somebody flying over your ramp wall and just one pumping you. Am I the only one that thinks this, or is there a good justification for removing it? If you think it should stay, i'd gladly listen as to why the jetpack should remain in fortnite!",FortNiteBR

Hear Me Out...,"Before you click away, this isn’t a “Epic PLZ unlimited Jumpz!” thread. I want to understand if other players feel the mechanic serves its purpose and is or isn’t a necessity. 

Is jump fatigue necessary?

It was probably implemented to stop jump spamming in general, but has it?

 Watch literally any streamer... when they sprint they jump, jump, sprint for 0.5 seconds and double jump again, repeat. 

When people fight, they jump constantly. Good players time their jumps with the smallest delay possible and manage to maintain solid and consistent jump height. 

Good players are using jump and working around delay to do exactly what jump fatigue is supposed to prevent, now let’s get to the real problem since it’s mostly avoidable in every other scenario. 

Where does jump fatigue literally get even the best players killed...? Build battles. 

We’ve all been in a situation where we’re getting our build destroyed and we’re building up to stand a chance when suddenly you can’t make it onto your own ramp because your feet are glued to the floor. You have to jump when you rotate to build up and depending on how many people are shooting you out; you don’t have time to stop. 

This is the only situation where I even notice jump fatigue exists. It feels bad because it’s often unavoidable. 

I don’t believe it’s a necessary mechanic at all. The game is already functioning in a Halo-esque jump battle meta. It doesn’t affect the face to face battles. We already have no fatigue sprint. Is it at all necessary?

What are your thoughts on this mechanic? Does it make the game better? 

TL;DR Jump delay doesn’t affect the shotgun battles between good players. It doesn’t stop people from jump spamming across the map. It just gets people killed when they’re building in high pressure situations. ",FortNiteBR

There has been an ongoing problem of leechers, afkers, scammers and a toxic community. When you go on the global chat in PvE all you mostly see are trading offers which are mostly scams. This mode used to have a kind, caring, helpful community, where all trades were fair and scammers barely existed. As you guys may know, PvP aka BR has a much more horrible, toxic, idiotic community. Just go on the Fortnite twitter and look at the comments. All the comments are about bringing back skins mainly skull trooper, people calling each other bad stuff through memes, and people asking to bring back refunds. This is just a glimpse of how bad the BR community is and I know not everyone is like that, but that's still a high majority of people. To make PvE for free will make the community of Save the World much worse and it will be full of inexperienced leechers who don't know what they're doing. Having Save the World is a bragging right and a cool thing currently. It's like back in Season 1/ Season 2 when having a skin from the item shop was majestic and you would rarely see that skin, now every skin that comes out, lots of people get and it's not as rare and special. To us PvE players, Save the World is like a VIP club to us, where we feel special and blessed. A issue that instantly come to mind is VBucks. In PvE we make a bunch of VBucks every day, which allows us to buy Llamas or cosmetics from BR. It's like a special part of PvE because not everyone in BR has VBucks, so it makes us special. It will be a complete nightmare to see free to play BR players suddenly get VBucks and have a large amount of VBucks allowing them to buy many skins. This will not only decrease VBucks value, it will also decrease the thrill of having a cosmetic in BR, due to the fact that with more VBucks, more people will have more cosmetics. Now, Epic may give PvE players the Rose Team Leader and Warpaint, but that isn't really good enough. Sure they are legendary and will be a bit rare, but the warpaint skin in my opinion should not be a legendary, just a good rare or an epic and the Rose Team Leader, is just a default Ramirez reskin with pink hair and outfit color, and a hat on which should honestly be a green or blue skin. Aside from that, severs in PvE will crash more often and games will be a complete mess. I know epic games did say it would be free in the future, but honestly it is us the community that could change that. Epic Games can't undo what they said, but they can agree to listen to the PvE community and cancel PvE for free. It may be alot to ask for, but together, we the PvE players can stop the BR players from ruining PvE. 25k upvotes and Epic Games needs to take this into consideration. Thank You!",FortNiteBR

Hands down.  Never seen anything like it.

Watching a class of kids spontaneously break out into their individual favorite Fortnite dances is, as a parent and gamer, a memory which will always make me smile!

During a recent “overnite” camping trip, I noticed a few of the kids got quite big when the others were discussing their favorite skins and the Battlepass challenges.  At dinner I asked one of them about the game.

He loves the game.  His mom lets him play after all his chores and homework are done.  I thought that was awesome.  

He got a bit sad when he told me he only had the default skin and dance.  His mom just doesn’t have the money for him to get VBucks.

At that moment I really wished I could have gifted him a skin and emote.  It would have meant the world to him, it really would.

So, Epic, could you do Teachers a solid and somehow give them the ability to gift items to economically challenged families?

Maybe they send you a copy of their teacher ID and you send them a few cards that allow someone with zero in game purchases to get something for free?  Maybe an exclusive Apple backpack or Apple harvesting tool that only a teacher can gift to others?

You have a monumental opportunity to help teachers be cool in the eyes of their students.

Let's keep the jet pack and maybe add a backpack slot to the inventory so we can all have our loadout and some sort of special modifier (backpack) when you try out the other new backpack ideas you have.

There's a reason why Fortnite got it's popularity during Season 2. It was because the game used to be a contest of building skills, strategy and aiming.
Adding double pump again : Ok, acceptable cuz it's slower than it originally was.
Adding Hovering rocks and a Jetpack after that? : Are you trying to lose half you playerbase Epic?
Getting a Jetpack and a hovering rock in Dusty or anywhere, makes the game so stupid. Even with good building skills it's hard to counter that cuz they easily get the high ground by fking FLYING. 
How about adding some wings too Epic, make it so ppl can literally fly for how long they want.
I made this post cuz i want Epic devs to read it. Listen to your community, don't just test random stuff. I know this is in Alpha phase but nevertheless don't put random stuff in-game just to test them. If you so much want to test those stupid ideas, then create another Test server where a few chosen players can try them out and give their opinion. ",FortNiteBR

This might not seem like a big deal, but for creators—the YouTubers/streamers covering this game—this makes covering new Item Shop drops impossible. This puts the US creators at a significant advantage and IMO that’s unhealthy for the creator community.

For players, it’s a similar situation. Everyone in Europe misses out on the excitement of watching the Item Store refresh and copping the latest gear.

**Epic, I think there’s a potential solution. What if the Item Store refresh was moved to 12PM (midday) Eastern? That works out as 9AM PDT / 5PM UK and 6PM Western Europe allowing everyone to jump on the new skins and emotes immediately.**

Factions would be a great addition to this game, for those who played D2 I feel like it could work like that, if you haven’t my idea is that their is “Faction Specific Challenges” every week that once completed give each member 5 tier stars and level up your faction (idk how they would want Faction levels to work) 

These challenges could be stuff like 
-Play games with Faction member
-Win a game with at least one faction member in your party
-Get 1000 kills as a faction 
Ect....

You could have 5 challenges per week with specific rewards once a faction is leveled up (Such as a spray with a faction banner, a Golden pickaxe) BUT to get the rewards you would most likely need to buy the battle pass so epic isn’t losing money.

Factions could have up to 20 members so people can’t just feed off the faction and get the loot and maybe have a Faction leaderboard? 

This idea would be great for Season 5 and would make Fortnite sooooooo much more fun to play and grind with friends.

It seems that all of the bots (or no-skins or bad players whatever you want to call them) only play the 50v50 mode. In my last twenty solo games I haven't found I single bad player, maybe an unfortunate one with no mats but never one that is bad. Though in my last twenty 50v50 games pretty much everyone I run into either on my team or the opposing team are all bots. I feel that this hurts the game more than it helps it. 
One of the main things that has made Fortnite fun (for me at least) is being able to get kills and do well in games. When the only people in a solo lobby are sweaty addicts going for their 50th solo win it's not fun at all. I'd rather see that type of gameplay in a Solo Showdown type event. 
I've been waiting the last couple weeks to be able to have fun playing solos again because it's my favorite mode. But because I am just an average player I either loot a place no one else went to and get dropped in my first build fight or land where a ton of people land and try to win from there. 
A lot of people will say just get good but that's not my point. I don't want everyone in the game to be good because then Solo Mode just becomes the sweatiest gamemode where you either hide as a bush to get to top ten or slay out like a god. 
I'm not saying that this happens 100% of the time, I've gotten maybe three solo wins out of I don't know how many since 50v50 has come out.
tl;dr: My main point is, I think Epic should make 50v50 just a weekend event or something so that it's not there all the time to eat up all the bots. Please downvote me if you want to I just wanted to get this off my chest. I would love to hear what all you guys think as well.

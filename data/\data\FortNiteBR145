Like I would be just jumping around and all of a sudden they randomly pop or when I try to get a height advantage on an opponent I go too high up and it makes me an easy target to kill.

I used to play PC but got rid of it because I only used it to play fortnite so it wasn't worth keeping. That being said, I can't stand using the controller in shooting games on consoles, it's so inaccurate and I hate aim assist.

So why on Ps4 is KBM so utterly awful. My mouse aim feels absolutely horrific, I'm talking input delay, the mouse just feels floaty when I'm aiming and it's impossible to aim with sufficient accuracy. I'll turn my mouse and I won't turn in game until at least a second afterwards. Its absolutely ridiculous. Also, why is motion blur a forced option, in fact, why are ALL video settings mandatory and not optional, if I want to play without shadows, why am I forced to play with them.

Console fortnite needs to add video settings, it's 2018. I'm no developer but SURELY its literally a case of copying and pasting video customization from pc to console. ",FortNiteBR

More and more, I'm seeing people use RPG's and suicide to try and get themselves and you killed. If you damage them and they suicide, we really should get the kill credit. Call of Duty has this system where you get the 'Assisted Suicide' medal. Would be nice to have this so it actually punishes people that pull this stunt. Gives the survivor the kill credit and in Team Rumble, that just gives the enemy team another point. Maybe even take it further and have teams lose a point if someone suicides...

As is, the RPG suiciders are really annoying and there's no incentive to not fire an RPG at point blank because you respawn in Team Rumble. In Solo/Duo/Squads, it'd be nice to get the kill credit as well. It's pretty annoying when you chunk someone and they try to suicide on you to take you both out but you survive and miss out on a kill...",FortNiteBR

We should all make our suggestions to make sure epic gets this right .,"Me personally I think they should be vaulted . They have added a stupid amount of mobility . They are too tanky and it’s basically a free redeploy when you exit them . For all of us who fought to remove glider redeployment I think the planes are 100 times worse . I doubt they are going to be vaulted so they at least need a serious nerf .

My biggest problem with them is that the planes Health just eats through my bullets and then when you finally destroy one there is no consequence to the driver . If they don’t bail out in time it should be an instant kill . It’s not fair I waste all my bullets and health trying to destroy this plane and the. The driver can just glide down with all his ammo and matts and kill me . 

The planes should not be able to drove through buildings and structures without consequences. It should either damage or destroy the plane or slow it down drastically . Too many people are using these like the banshee or ghost in halo where they just kamakasi instead of learning to shoot it . 

Since the addition of planes the game doesn’t feel like Fortnite to me anymore . I know epic do a wonderful job of constantly updating and creating and it does keep the game feeling fresh . But this change has cause a drastic shift in the game it doesn’t feel like jolly old Fortnite anymore it feels like I’m playing a giant map on call of duty world at war but instead of tanks there’s planes . It just doesn’t have that same feel anymore . I know it’s the planes . I love the map changes I love the zip lines . Everything else .

I can’t count how many times iv been in the last 6 and someone has decided to kamakasi me . If I don’t manage to beat the plane leaving me weak anyway then I always get third partied by someone attracted by all the gun fire . ",FortNiteBR

Some people in this community thinks reporting people for hacking or anything similar makes you a pussy..
You get automatically called names because you play the game a certain way.
I like going for kills in game but that doesn't mean those who don't are noobs or wack. It's a battle royale you can literally do whatever you want to do to win a game. 
Streamers get hated on because it's cool to hate on them, discrediting all the hard work  and hours of practice they've done. Y'all pit streamers against one another.
Youtubers purposely paint some streamers in a bad way by editing clips.
The Fortnite community is the only community I've heard say to people who make money off of this game "" You make too much money, you don't deserve it"" How the fuck do you make too much money?
Half the little kids playing this game think they own the world because they label themselves ""pro players"". 
Fortnite drops item seasonal item shop skins (Skully, Nog) On Halloween and xmas month respectively and some of y'all lose your shit at epic for what reason? For doing their job?
SOME ""OGs"" think they're hella special because they literally downloaded the game early and played a few matches before everyone else. Anyone above the age of 16 shouldn't give 2 flying fucks about an item shop skin dropping, there are literally better things to worry about.
Like what is it with some of y'all? Lose touch with reality, it's a GAME.

It is as balanced as it has been in a very long time. Spray meta is seemingly over in a sense and it appears that the new pump is doing what it should be. There is not one perfect load out right now that is clearly the best. It is allowing for more variation to the game. 

I think Epics test and what they have been doing although may be annoying sometimes are certainly paying off as we are starting to see a positive difference in game! In my opinion it will continue to improve. 

I just am curious to see if you guys are also starting to feel this way or not?

The heavy just seems like it’s not a very viable weapon anymore, considering AT MAX it does less than one shot to a 100 health player body shot. It’s called a heavy, and yet its damage is less than almost every other shotgun in the game. And I know someone’s going to say, “But the heavy is only supposed to be accurate.” You’d be right, but since all shotguns were buffed to do at least 3 pellets damage no matter what, the fact that the heavy is accurate doesn’t matter any more. All the patches Epic has done with shotguns lately have just seemed to undermine one of my favorite guns in the game.

Okay here's my theory: Throughout the Winter season, this ice/snow will simply infect the rest of the island or some parts of that to that matter. In layman terms, it's going to spread to various regions. Now I was thinking that it may spread all the way to the Divot, why you may ask. Well how long has it been since there, SINCE SEASON 4! So they have to do something with the one place that nobody enjoys going into, right? Possible yes and no to that question, anyways... It will freeze a large sheet of ice over the top of the Divot and as it warms up, it will melt putting it all underwater. Since it's underwater, it would actually connect to the Moisty Merman skin (other than Moisty Mires connecting to the skin), and it would be a place for him to live or possibly somewhere else. It is a bit out there of a theory, but it would be very interesting because the people over at Epic Games have some pretty awesome minds. Also, how cool would it be if there was something like a ""breath rock"" that allowed us to see and breathe underwater for some time so we can fight in that low gravity underwater vibe?! Many things can happen within this season so I'm ready for it all! Also, bit of a spoiler but if you've been on Reddit or twitter you've already seen it. See, when you're on the wing of a plane and your buddy flies it upside down underneath the massive iceberg that hit, there is a giant town under there. So it's known that under Polar Peak a town will appear as it melts and it will change over time as well according to some game files I've seen floating around. It just goes to show how the people at Epic Games have thought so far ahead already.

That is my theory, Reddit heard it first and a YouTube video will be coming to help detail everything and clear up any questions :)",FortNiteBR

Its not that difficult to trap somebody in a box and lay down the trap. Its nearly impossible to react to as well, you have 1 second to try and break it or break the wall near you and hope you can catch yourself, good luck if your enemy puts 2+ of them. The thing also nullifies the grapple gun and can look insivisble if you can put your floor into a hill. It takes no accuracy to place this in front of your opponent too.

2. Make the max build height much lower maybe around 5 walls above the current ground you’re on so again people don’t just spam builds and get rid of build battles going up to the sky
3. Lower the max material cap I’ve heard this one a bunch but I think 300 wood 200 brick and 100 metal would be good so you have to be smart with your builds instead of just again spamming them and building skyscrapers ",FortNiteBR

Prior to season 7, I could win at least 4-5 games per day. I have yet to get a win in season 7. In seemingly every game, these things happen:

Winning a brutal build fight, then getting third and fourth partied. 

Getting 2 shot lasered by someone 100+ meters away

Building controls delayed (PS4)

Spas 12 doing 44 damage on a seemingly perfect headshot, then I get one-shotted. 

It's really discouraging because I feel like I get killed even though I outplay my opponents. Just feels like dumb luck at this point. What would be some good ideas to help get me out of this hellish slump?",FortNiteBR

In the early game, you don't have time to look up at the ceiling in every room you enter (especially when chasing someone/being chased), and dying instantly even though you have full health and minis in such a situation is just stupid to me. I think just nerfing the dmg of traps would be sufficient. Even if they activate really fast, being hit for say  only100 will make it alot easier to survive if you get hit by a trap in early game/build fight.  


And before people start saying ""pay attention to ceilings, stay on the other side of the box so you don't get hit by the trap, learn to break traps faster blalblabla"", we all make mistakes, and everyone gets trapped every now and then. And while it is annoying, I have no problem with traps as an item, merely that it does 3/4 of your health if you are 100/100",FortNiteBR

I have zero knowledge about what weapons to go for and where to drop, so literally any advice would be appreciated! I’m going to practice while he works this week so we can marathon br during the weekend since college just ended for me and i have the free time.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Season 4** \- the first full season. added a huge dynamic with the meteor crash and the cool rocket launch event. it was probably the most fun i've had back when times were simpler and the game play was less complex because there were no mobiles, less weapon pool, no gimmicks
2. **Season 6** \- I really enjoyed this season because of the huge changes in gameplay after a bland season 5 with the introduction of the floating island, I enjoyed this POI because you could shoot enemies then fly around to escape or use it for mobility. also even though people hated them, I liked the cube monsters. 
3. **Season 3** \- only played half the season but because it was my first season I was still learning and just the novelty of playing and exploring a new game brings lots of excitement. but also because I still sucked I didn't win much so thats why its ranked 3rd.
4. **Season 7** \- been playing the season so far and its alright. I think its become very cluttered with so much happening in the game like the expansion of the map and all the different ways of mobility especially the planes. but it is what it is.
5. **Season 5** \- just felt very bland, just not very memorable to me other than the new POI of Paradise and the rifts. also I felt like it had the weakest battlepass compared to every other ones. ",FortNiteBR

It’s straight AIDs and I know it’s fun to use but this shit is just beyond frustrating to go up against between having to make so much noise to shoot it down that half the universe hears you and is on their way to you, the fact the pilot takes no fall damage or doesn’t blow up with the plane, you’ll have to now fight the pilot after just burning through 300 mats defending from his plane, etc. it’s just like why.

For the most part everyone on this subreddit just eats this shit up loving that they Epic holds their hand to save their precious 1 kd bot style of gameplay.

There’s literally no negatives I can think of to using a plane, just none. 

The only reason this game even gets away with this shit is only because the amount of hype and players who in reality don’t care about the game, instead of a clip of someone explaining exactly what the best changes to do to (insert item) or whatever, some dude hitting a 360 no scope for the millionth time will be put to the top of the page, rather than stuff that legit is a issue.

Call me sweaty no life or play another game, but the issue really is no game like Fortnite has exactly made me have such fun moments with a game but ever since S5 those feels have been just happening less and less.

Instead I’m wondering why I’m finding 30 balloons in a cluttered lootpool and the dude next to me finds 18 shotguns and a chug jug. I’m wondering how the fuck I could’ve “JuMpEd OuT tHe WaY” of a plane when it’s soaring at me at 80mph and the pilot will just redirect to me anyways.",FortNiteBR

This would help New players get a couple of kills in the early game, but finding it would be rare and you would not be able to purchase from a vending machine 
This would also help people without the battlepass to get leveled up and tiered up quickly because of all the free stuff on the free battlepass

If you want to privately talk to us about this Idea contact us on Xbox or Mesage me on Discord, my Xbox is ChillManx607906 and my friends Xbox is HitManJr2407

After playing this game since the beginning of season 3 and following it since season 2 (wasn't a big fan at first) I can honestly say that I am fed up with it. I truly lost hope for getting revived any time I go down. It's so dumb how there's no grace period after getting down (and not the little delay because of server lag) there are a couple of reasons I hate this idea besides the ones already stated. 1- l can't tell you how many times I was in a duo/squad fill and my teammates were busy finishing an opponent that they did not focus on the fight and died. An simle fix to this (since I know we've all experienced it) would be to add a small grace period OR remove it completely.  I'm curious what you guys' thoughts are on this topic. please don't be a stranger :),FortNiteBR

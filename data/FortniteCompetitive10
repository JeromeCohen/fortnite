I upgraded to a pc a few months ago from an xbone and it‚Äôs incredible. 

When i first got it i was kinda underwhelmed and didn‚Äôt notice a huge difference like everyone was saying. But after 2 months of playing at 144 hz I went back to my xbox just to see how it was. Ladies and gentleman the difference is night and day. On the pc (with controller) I am consistently placing in the money in the weekend qualifier but on the 60hz xbox i feel like total bot. My buddies who I dominated in 1v1s  consistently kick my ass when I‚Äôm on my xbox. 

Everything is so smooth on the pc: edits, smg tracking, flick pumps, 90s and other builds. I never realized how clunky my xbox was until I experience the other side.

I have spent quite a bit of time in aiming maps and edit course maps, both of which require cross hair control to progress at.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a formal petition to change places of qualifications of duo teams for the Fortnite World Cup Finals.

&amp;#x200B;

We think that it is necessary to change them since the region of Brazil in these last weeks has been demonstrating a different level from what was thought-out.

If we check the amount of points that are needed to qualify from Saturday's event to Sunday's finals among the best 1500 teams, Brazil doubles Oceania and Asia's regions, which have the same qualifying positions in the weeks of duos than the South American region. At the same time, NA-West has 1 place to qualify per duo week, and the number of points needed to qualify from first to second stage are 4 in Week #2 and 3 in Week #4 more than in our server, which is almost no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

Points needed for the qualification of the best 1500 duos in Week #2:

&amp;#x200B;

Points needed for the qualification of the best 1500 duos in Week #4:

Here there is a screenshot from a tweet of a Brazil player who compiled all of the points required to qualify in the same tweet: [https://imgur.com/a/jcs1FsL](https://imgur.com/a/jcs1FsL) (Credits given in the image)

&amp;#x200B;

Places of qualification for every region:

&amp;#x200B;

This information can also be checked in-game following the steps: Battle Royale &gt; Compete &gt; Select the desired event &gt; Event Details

To see the others regions statistics, you have to change the Matchmaking region by following these steps: Battle Royale &gt; Configuration &gt; Game &gt; Region &gt; Matchmaking region

&amp;#x200B;

We believe that the places in the Fortnite World Cup thought-out for Brazil were based in statistics prior to the World Cup, which is not wrong but is not entirely right because of the following arguments:

In the Scallywag Cup, for example, it was allowed to play in any region you wanted (schedules of the Europe and NA regions did not match, so the players could play in both regions, when in our case the schedules did match with the NA region (in addition to the ping we have in this servers)), this caused that the points had a lot of difference, adding that the price was not the same that is given in the World Cup qualification weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

We think that it would be fairer to have 2 more qualifying positions for the region of Brazil which would be for the weeks of duo that do not have none (Week #4 and Week #8) where possible, if not accommodate them in the remaining weeks of duo.

&amp;#x200B;

We are aware that the places for the World Cup are already established but we believe that they can be better balanced so that it is fairer for our region.

&amp;#x200B;

We are sorry if there is an error in the translation and we are open to any kind of question.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and we are waiting for an answer from Epic Games if possible.

Espa√±ol/Spanish:

Esto es una petici√≥n formal para cambiar puestos de clasificaci√≥n de equipos de d√∫os para la final de la Copa del Mundo.

&amp;#x200B;

Pensamos que es necesario un cambio ya que la regi√≥n de Brasil en estas √∫ltimas semanas estuvo demostrando un nivel diferente al que se ten√≠a previsto. Si nos fijamos en la cantidad de puntos necesarios para clasificar del s√°bado al domingo entre los mejores 1500 equipos, Brasil duplica a las regiones de Ocean√≠a y Asia, las cuales tienen los mismos puestos de clasificaci√≥n en las semanas de d√∫os que la regi√≥n sudamericana. A su vez, la costa oeste de EE.UU. tiene 1 puesto por evento de d√∫o, y los puntos necesarios de clasificaci√≥n de la primera etapa a la segunda son 4 en la Semana #2 y 3 en la Semana #4 m√°s que en nuestro servidor, una diferencia casi nula. 

&amp;#x200B;

Puntos necesarios para la clasificaci√≥n de los mejores 1500 d√∫os en la Semana #2:

[https://imgur.com/a/4simDS5](https://imgur.com/a/4simDS5)

&amp;#x200B;

Puntos necesarios para la clasificaci√≥n de los mejores 1500 d√∫os en la Semana #4:

Ac√° hay una screenshot de un tweet de un jugador del servidor de BR la cual recopila todos los puntos en un mismo tweet: [https://imgur.com/a/jcs1FsL](https://imgur.com/a/jcs1FsL) (Cr√©ditos

en la imagen)

&amp;#x200B;

Gr√°fico comparando los puntos necesarios para la clasificaci√≥n en todas las regiones y todas las semanas jugadas hasta la fecha (5/6/2019) (MM/DD/YYYY):

[https://imgur.com/a/4FZh9Fi](https://imgur.com/a/4FZh9Fi) (Cr√©ditos en la imagen)

&amp;#x200B;

Puestos de clasificaci√≥n para todas las regiones:

[https://imgur.com/a/bi8e2kW](https://imgur.com/a/bi8e2kW)

&amp;#x200B;

Esta informaci√≥n se puede ver dentro del juego tambi√©n en la secci√≥n de Battle Royale &gt; Competir &gt; Seleccionar el evento deseado &gt; Informaci√≥n del evento.

Para ver las estad√≠sticas de las dem√°s regiones, solamente hay que cambiar la regi√≥n de emparejamiento en Battle Royale &gt; Configuraci√≥n &gt; Juego &gt; Regi√≥n &gt; Regi√≥n de emparejamiento

&amp;#x200B;

Creemos que los puestos que fueron pensados para Brasil estuvieron basados en estad√≠sticas previas al mundial, lo cual no est√° mal pero no es del todo acertado por lo siguiente: En la copa Scallywag, por ejemplo, se permit√≠a jugar en varias regiones (los horarios de las regiones Europa y EE.UU. no coincid√≠an, entonces los jugadores pod√≠an jugar en ambas regiones, y en nuestro caso los horarios coincid√≠an con la regi√≥n de EE.UU. (adem√°s del ping considerable en estos servidores)), esto caus√≥ que los puntos tuvieran mucha diferencia, agregando que el premio no era el mismo que en las semanas de clasificaci√≥n de la Copa del Mundo.

&amp;#x200B;

Nos parece que lo m√°s justo ser√≠a tener 2 puestos de clasificaci√≥n m√°s para la regi√≥n de Brasil que ser√≠an para las semanas de d√∫o que no tienen ninguno (Semana #4 y Semana #8) en lo posible, sino acomodarlos en las semanas restantes de d√∫o.

&amp;#x200B;

Somos conscientes de que las plazas para la Copa del Mundo ya est√°n establecidas pero creemos que se pueden balancear mejor para que sea m√°s justo para nuestra regi√≥n.

&amp;#x200B;

**Region:** NAE

**Age:** 21 almost 22 (now 22)

**Platform:** PC

**Gamertag:** Coach.21

**Stats/Experience:**

Solo Finals - 468th place

Duo Finals - 550 place (with a random controller player)

Scallywag Final 278th place (same guy)

Contender in solos (didn't get to play placement matches)

STL duo Contender (only got to play the placement games due to a job)

Week 3 Solo finals 1700th ish place (would have to look it up to be exact, but on my laptop right now)

Only been taking comp seriously for about 8-9 months and scrim about 4-5 nights a week. I am fairly good mechanically as I have been grinding 1v1s for the past 10-11 months.

---
**Misc:** I coach baseball so I will need someone who is willing to scrim later at night when practices are over. I usually get home around 8:30pm (CST) and can play tell Midnight. I work mornings from 4-8 and usually take a nap, but once games start I will use this time to get more practice in. I wont be able to play from 3-8:30am and 2:30-8:30pm until May 24th (can obviously play on the weekends), Then my practice schedule will change and we can talk about that when the time comes.

Back to fortnite. I play a lot more solo scrims than duos so I am unsure if my comms are good or not, but my recent duo didn't say much about them. I feel I make very smart decisions about when and where to rotate, but want to learn how others do things to further expand my knowledge. The thing I struggle with most is when to take high ground late game. I have just started today going back and watching the vods of people who had high ground in my games and trying to learn from that.

---
Wrote that recent Paragraph about a month ago. Here is a list of things that I honestly feel I have improved at.

\-Rotating to half in half on zone

\-Taking high ground

\-When to play aggressive late moving zones

\-I feel my comms are decent, but old duo still never said anything about it

\- I also never play with ballers, so I feel I have learned how to rotate well.

I can play support or the aggressor. Can also IGL if need.

---
Things I want from a partner

\- Be honest about what we need to work on or what you think needs to change

\- Make it clear what role we are playing, whether that be IGL or support and aggressor (Obviously it can change during game, but nice to know how we are going to approach a fight)

\- Good Comms

\- Doesn't get upset easily when practicing

\- Also mechanically good

A little background 'story'.  
I started playing scrims around 6 months ago, with first real ingame competitive events being Share the Love, where I got champs in both solos and duos.  
Did decent in those, and then came the 100k cups. Placed top 100 in Blackheart, and top 80 in Luxe and Scally, so I'd say I'm a decent player.  
Ever since stretched got banned, I've yet to find my old form. My confidence can't seem to return to 'normal'.  
I used to be able to W-key everyone in arena and win most of the fights easily. Now, I can barely contest my main landing spot without dying.  
I am also yet to even qualify to the WC finals. had 61 points week 4 duos and 59 week 2, so always have been close atleast.

Is that fair that I have a macro and the other one doesnt and we have the same ping but he will replace my wall and I don't replace his wall? No, it's not fair.

So how you fix it?

You have 2 options:

1. Make wall replace  possible for everyone, sounds crap to me but still an option to reduce praying to god when you hold your turbo building that the guy isn't martoz(0 ping).
2. (the best option) Make wall replace impossible for everyone, everytime a wall is destroyed only the guys outside your team can't place a wall in that exact same position for 0.15ms, it sounds ridiculously small time, but this is definitely should make wall replacements impossible for \*everyone\*(unless you have 150ping against 0 and then this is a problem) and that's fucking fair for both sides, no praying, not advantages, not disadvantages because you are in a region far away from Amazon Servers.

What do you think?

 Just to understand - 0.15ms is so little time that unless you're trying to replace a wall you should not feel it at all ingame.

Me and my duo have been scrimming for 8+ months, and in the WC warmup, placed top 500 in NA-East and 120th in NA-West. I remember that week leading up to the WC Warmup, we decided to only do Arena, because we felt our weakness was taking fights and finishing them. We also felt our communication lacked in fights, even though it was solid end-game. 

So like I said, we did really well that week. Aftewards, we decided ""ok good, we're doing much better in fights now, let's grind out customs because the finals end-games are STACKED, and the only way to practice for them is playing in customs.""

While the statement might be true about the only way to achieve stacked end-games is to play in customs, you SHOULD NOT only play customs to practice for the WC qualifiers...here's why. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week we had an atrocious week (we couldn't play week 2), filled with bugs killing us and getting griefed constantly. We didn't even qualify for the finals. Now I'd love to say bugs and getting griefed were the reason we didn't make it - but that's just a petty excuse. One of us ended up dying mid-game 4 times, and 3 of those 4 times, we had 1 player knocked on the duo we were fighting, and at least 1 of us went down after that. That it is a prime example of not fighting well together, and having bad comms. 

Whether we like it or not, mid-game fights happen. You don't get free rotations. You don't get to sit in storm for 50 ticks of HP like in customs collecting loot, cuz you know you can hit a fire. Everyone late-game doesn't have 200 hp, 2 slurps and 6 minis. Getting picks on rotations in the 4th and 5th zone are extremely important in WC Qualifiers, whereas it's nearly impossible in customs. Winning those 3 or 4 mid-game fights YOU WILL HAVE is extremely important. 

My point is customs are good for exactly 2 things - early game contest practice at your scrim spot, and stacked end-game practice for 5th zone on. Learning how to rotate in a real game is extremely important. You should do customs to practice those 2 things, but you should not equate success in customs to success in the qualifiers. They are completely different. I would highly recommend spending the majority of your time in Arena opposed to in customs. I'm not saying don't play customs, just have like a 70/30 split, or maybe even 60/40 if you feel your end-game is really weak.

Secondly, I have always been positive regarding Epic and Fortnite, but lately my opinion has shifted a little. The following is my opinion on where Epic has gone wrong.   First of all- Epic needs to realize that what we want is honesty from them. Like when they removed the sword, they admitted they were wrong. They were transparent and honest. Now, they seem like they think they're invincible.   Enough about Epic though, let's get into the state of the game, future evolution, and how the past will affect the future. From a competitive viewpoint, Fortnite is not in a great place. Every single game that has been popular competitively for years and years has an FOV option. When Apexx first came out, it had an FOV option. CS:GO has an FOV option. Even legendary console games such as Halo and Call of Duty have FOV sliders. This would help a lot with the hurt the pro community felt after the removal of stretched resolution. In other competitive thoughts, an option to change what side you peak from would be amazing. Every successful comp game has peak switch, from R6S to COD it is a universally loved option for comp players.   Bugs are a common problem in FN as well, from not being granted health after drinking a chug jug to not being able to build in certain situations, these bugs need to be fixed and publicly addressed by Epic that they at least realize the bugs exist and are working to fix them. Adding a bunch of new items into the game only makes room for more bugs, and as a community we would be fine with not getting invisible bombs or an explosive bow for a few weeks as long as the bugs were fixed instead. (Building bugs, chug jugs not applying health after being used, there are many many bugs that make the game insanely unbearable at times it would take two paragraphs to explain them all).   From a pub standpoint, if siphon is not coming back at least increase farm rate so games aren't as slow!! This is a comprise most people would agree with I feel.   From a general perspective, balance is much needed, Fortnite keeps adding in game changing weapons and vehicles (ballers are a current example, the sword was the worst idea ever in any video game). Balance the current meta before adding in newer items- just like fixing bugs before adding new items. Heavy Sniper is insanely OP as it can break through every single structure on the map with one shot- NOT EVEN AN RPG CAN DO THIS. Not to mention the flintlock's Oper powered nature, or the boom bows laser sight and 100 splash damage, the one shot non shield body shot for every pump except the green pump, how bad and ineffective the tac shotgun is, blank hitmakers with every single AR in the game, pumps not shooting when equipped (THIS IS HUGE IN COMP FORTNITE AND HAPPENS ALL THE TIME). The point is, balance the weapons and fix the bugs that occur with them.   Future of Fortnite looks bleak currently. It looks like many players not wanting to and then gradually being so depressed playing it that they have to give it up. If the community never has a voice, the game won't have a community much longer. Fortnite- we all love you and we don't wanna give up on you. Please do the right thing.

Besides what button should i use?  
I currently use F to edit and if i wanted to edit with 2 key binds i would press them on different fingers.

I can't put it on my mouse since all my building key binds are on my mouse.

#Season 9 Fixes

**[Audio Content, Features, and Fixes for 9.0 Release](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/blfnsb/audio_content_features_and_fixes_for_90_release/)**
 
* Post by zakbeaudio

 &gt; **Release 9.0 Audio fixes and updates:**

 &gt; * Switch audio dropout issues fixed.
 &gt; * Better tactical audio when inside player-built structures:
   &gt; * Enemy Pickaxe impact within \~one building tile radius has new,  louder sound.
  &gt;  * Wallbreak by enemy close/behind player much clearer/louder.
 &gt; * Explosion audio improvements- shorter, higher dynamic range sounds that will make explosion audio clearer and punchier.

 &gt; **Release 9.0 open audio issues:**

 &gt; * Fix for PC audio device swap issues; we are planning to have this for the 9.1 release.

 &gt; **What we‚Äôre working on for the upcoming season:**

 &gt; * Fix for footstep sounds on the edge of structures gives audio as if you're walking on the ground.
 &gt; * Better hear the approach of enemy players outside player-built structures.
 &gt; * Better audio tells for jump/landing:
  &gt;  * Jump tell audio added (so bunny-hopping isn‚Äôt as noiseless).
  &gt;  * Clearer landing sound detection.
 &gt; * Improvements to issues of sounds dropping outside of player FOV.
 &gt; * Improvement of close versus distant player gliding sounds, to help clarify distance of gliding enemies.
 &gt; * Longer sounds properly playing during Replays.
 &gt; * Improved differentiation of teammate verus enemy audio.
 &gt; * Internal testing of binaural/HRTF solution that will be a great help to headphone players, as well as other spatialization improvements.

 &gt; Hey Folks,

 &gt; We want to address a concern that has been brought up regarding Shadow Bombs. We received a report that if a 
 player was eliminated under the effect of the Shadow Bomb that they would keep invisibility and all movement buffs when they respawn. This issue is only occurring in modes that had respawns enabled, such as Team Rumble.

 &gt; However, if you're experiencing or observing this happening in other non-respawn modes or tournament modes please let us know!

I'm relatively new here, so don't hate. I need your advice.

So here's my situation. I've been playing a lot of fortnite during seasons 3-5 and then my drive for the game has started dropping and I pretty much left the game after season 6, so I played couple matches in season 7 and missed season 8 entirely. Despite all the hate for the game, I got really interested in the game again, when they added siphon, so I started following it and wanted to try to learn the game again, when they've added arena mode. and become better and try it on competitive level. 

&amp;#x200B;

So little less, than two weeks ago I started grinding arena and decided, that I will try my best and get to champions without using ballers. I've been doing edit/building courses at least an hour per day, so I've improved dramatically compared to where I started. I've reached 300 points yesterday and I fee, that I really enjoy the game and that I am becoming more passionate about it the more I improve and higher I get.¬†But I know, that I need to improve and practice, to move forward consistently. 

So here's my problem. I've been always talented, when it came to competitive games and my aim has always been really good and consistent, but my buildings skills are extremely lacking. I more or less know how to snake and turtle now, but when it comes to such things as rotations end game or build fights, I get outplayed almost every time. So I basically have to fight low ground and each time and the only way me to win fights is to out-aim an opponent basically. That way I've been consistently getting 2-5 kills per game, but I get destroyed, by a descent builder or during end game rotations.¬†

I would really appreciate if you could share your personal experience of how you've personally dealt with those things and what are the most efficient ways in your opinion to improve in taking high grounds, rotations and just being a better builder when it comes to 1v1 fights? How to improve in positional awareness and not get tunnel-visioned as soon you hear shots firing.

&amp;#x200B;

What I do currently: 

I watch a lot of fortnite pro streams and I definitely learn a lot, but it doesn't really help me mechanically.

I'm doing edit courses daily and improving my times every day.

Just doing building in creative.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just do 1v1's against better players? Are there discords or anything with EU players where you can find people who want to practice against a noob like me. I am willing to put up to 4 hours a day into practicing and learning, but I just need to find the most efficient way to improve. Maybe there are good streams and youtube channels you could recommend with proper educational content (it's really hard to find something descent among millions of trash fortnite channels).

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate all the advises really. Peace.",FortniteCompetitive

I was very frustrated and did not know what game could replace it. I finally decided to try out pubg on steam- let me just say now, worth it!

I have not logged on to fortnite ever since, and never plan to, ever again. I do not care for season 9 and I'm not going to even log on ONCE because that's how superior pubg is. Let me explain why though. 

- **Less RNG**: So pubg is not plagued with insane rng like there is in fortnite. It still has some rng elements, but the end game comes down to skill and awareness, rather than who has the most rifts/mats, who gets the circle for high ground, etc. 

- **Requires more skill** : you cannot just hop on pubg and spam the boom bow for free kills. Every gun has bullet drop, so if you get clapped across the map- you deserved it. The map is also very large, giving time to strategize and execute insane plays 

- **The devs actually care about the competitive scene** : This ones pretty self explanatory. Less children play pubg than fortnite, which means it will overall have more quality to it

- **The sound is way better than Fortnite's ever was** : self explanatory here as well. You hear footsteps accurately, sound is quite amazing when you compare it to fortnite


- **The game has more realistic graphics and better looking visuals** : Fortnite has this childish garbage cartoony look, and the visuals are quite plain and made for children. Pubg's graphics are not cute and colorful, but rather realistic and beautiful. They are also better textures and the world feels a lot more immersive

- **Pubg runs better now compared to current fortnite and has less bugs** : this is also a surprising fact. The devs actually care about their game, so they have improved performance and bugs across the board. It is quite impressive, and honestly shows what quality devs can do  



I can imagine fortnite will die mid season 9, since many streamers and content creators are going to quit. Epic will add on more bugs and goofy weapons until they hit their intended community: 5 year olds.",FortniteCompetitive

What we want are options to play with shield for kill without facing PC players all day and regular pubs are tedious

It's kind of mind boggling that they don't allow stretch because they don't want to allow settings that gives an advantage over other players but forces console players who can't even get stable 60 FPS in with 240+ FPS PC players who can turn off shadows and tweak other things we can't, and have way better hipfire aim due to mouse.

I know one of the only reasons are so we can qualify for world cup but really how many console players are really playing arena to be in world cup though? Nick mercs and Aydan did good that one time and that's their rationale to throw us in with PC like we're equal. Not to mention, they both use controller on PC which isn't even close to being the same as using controller on console(Aim assist works better for them, no input lag, much better frames and display). How hard is it to understand we just want shield for kill, and not want to play against PC and compete in the world cup because it's impossible getting like 20 frames in end circles.

I see this community say all the time that the true competitive part of Fortnite only makes up 1% but if you're just talking about console Fortnite players that percentage is more like .10%. I want to play with the optimal settings(Siphon, mats on kill, buffed farming) without playing against people with major advantages.

I know what you're probably thinking. ""The matchmaking is already bad and this will make it worst"" first off, you shouldn't put hundreds of thousands of players in a bad situation for that reason alone. Secondly, the reason the matchmaking is bad is because of how the ranking system is set up. Take away open league and just have 3 or 4 leagues and make it harder to climb up and able to be demoted easier. You don't start losing a decent chunk of points until champion league so even bad players eventually end up there if they play enough and that is completely broken and not true ranked.",FortniteCompetitive

I realized low sensitivity does more bad than good for me. When i play against a bot low sensitivity feels good but playing against a better and more slimy player that cant stand in one place, low sensitivity becomes a nightmare. How do you guys manage to build edit and shoot and not have your mouse position in a awkward position. 

A lot of the time i build then when I suddenly need to shoot my hand in an awkward position causing me to miss. This makes gunfights really inconsistent when going against good vs bad players. It also makes building and editing extremely sluggish. I recently switch to 400 dpi and .17 in game and building and editing have become so much easier. While my shot is currently horrible i feel like i can improve it. 

I was just wondering what benefits do lower sensitivity have or in other words how do you avoid my problems with low sensitivity before i fully commit to a high sensitivity. What kept me from switching to high sensitivity was the fact that tfue a pro that has arguably one of the best aim in fortnite uses low sensitivity, so why should I, a less mechanically precise player use a higher sensitivity even though it requires more precision to aim well with high sensitivity.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure many of you guys noticed that when you play with your fps-settings at unlimited you get very bad input lag when using a standard DS4-controller. You can also notice that if you turn down your deadzone settings to minimum your controller-sticks in the most cases will cause drifting.   

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the solution for this. If you start Steam and add the Epic launcher as a ""non-steam game"" and start Epic-launcher via Steam you will notice a big difference in the input-lag at unlimited frames and you will be able to lower your deadzones to a lower setting than you could before without any drift problems. I don't necessarily advice anyone to play at the lowest deadzone setting or unlimited fps, that is completely up to your preferences. In my opinion it seems like steam handle the controller input way better than just Fortnite itself and I recommend you guys to try it out.  

&amp;#x200B;

What is your thoughts about this, is there any downside for players to use this method? Let me know what you think.",FortniteCompetitive

If you're looking for a SERIOUS e-sport and are still playing Fortnite, you deserve all the drum guns, swords and planes in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain. First of all let's agree on the following.

1. Fortnite is the most popular game right now
2. Fortnite is ***A GAME***
3. Fortnite's target audience is kids between ages 7-15 or something like that?

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few hours all I see is people complaining about the casual part of the community and while I'm used to it, today it got scary. I see people in the comments saying how ""casuals shouldn't vote"" and how ""we, the competitive community, know better.""  


Question:  
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?????? By the same logic, a politician should say, meh... no plebs can vote. No vote for women either. Only famous or rich people will vote. Go democracy!

&amp;#x200B;

Please, try to refrain from supporting shady opinions just like that. Can't you just appreciate that **FOR ONCE** Epic actually asked the community what they wanted? They could just as easily bring back **planes** and the freakin' **sword**. Casuals would still be happy. But no, this time they genuinely did it right. You all are just salty about the result; and that's just pathetic to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely understand that you (me as well) are trying to take the game seriously but it's time you accept that this isn't the right game to be taken seriously. You absolutely have to accept that Epic has and always will cater the needs of the majority of players.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, let's be real. From all Fortnite players, the competitive community is something close to 2% (somewhere I read that). From all the competitive community let's say that only around 2000 people will ever be able to make something (money) out of it. The rest of us are here because we enjoy a little competition and the occasional grind over the leaderboards. My point is, just accept the game as it is or MOVE ON. You will not always be 17 with the luxury of complaining about a stupid game all day.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Yeah they should have a separate competitive loot pool for arena but they will not do that.  Just accept it.",FortniteCompetitive

But in a general sense how can we say Wuji definitively did something here.

And I knows it‚Äôs a lot to ask of this echo chamber but ima need you guys to put down your pitchforks and think logically and think for yourselves here. (Also don‚Äôt just downvote without responding, generally trying to come to an understanding)

What proof do we have? I‚Äôll write some of the common reasons I found below, feel free to add some in the comments:

 1. *He hasn‚Äôt landed there all session*
As suspicious as this may sound I think many of us have done this before. If chances of qualification are slim, why not change up drops? He landed on a ball spawn by chair, and now he landed at a ball spawn by volcano. This really isn‚Äôt super strong evidence.

 2. *He saw someone land on a pump, why would he still go there?*
From experience a pump where xxif got one is not as large of advantage as you would think. Just by gliding by there you can see the whole edge railing has no immediate mats and is generally not an ideal environment for a pump engagement. Xxif can easily be forced out of the spot to drop into lava if Wuji gets an AR or any decent medium range weapon. 

 3. *He pickaxes random shit and doesn‚Äôt make an effort to get the kill or survive*
This might be the strongest argument as even in   [his pov](https://www.twitch.tv/boswuji_/clip/CalmStormyMarjoramPeanutButterJellyTime?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) he does some unusual shit for someone of his supposed skill level. But realistically it can be argued that the mistakes are simply due to inexperience at the spot. He was getting the gun under the stairs when xxif shot his first shot. He then turned around into a purple pump that he couldn‚Äôt see when he landed. He attempted to pickaxe the small box for mats but ended up pickaxing the chest. 

**Main Problem** 

Obviously this is simply how I interpreted it as someone who has rarely heard of these players, and it can and has been interpreted in a number of different ways. 

But personally I don‚Äôt see how this evidence in itself is enough to ban someone for 14 days. As far as I am aware there was no prior instances unlike the gester (gesty?) guy.",FortniteCompetitive

Aside from whether the play was bad or not, was I in the wrong for shooting at somebody despite not being threatened by storm surge? With most cases of vague situations, any interpretation is set into place. Before the off-spawn rules were implemented, there were multiple interpretations of what that meant. Certain off-spawns to people were anybody who came to their spot, even if they did not land at the spot. Some off-spawn meant only those who came to your spot. With storm surge being barely specified, why am I held accountable for fighting when others think it is okay to fight? Because I'm above storm surge? Where does it say that anyone above storm surge can't shoot. Am I being punished for disregarding the rules or because I'm an asshole? Being banned isn't what concerns me, but rather the injustice of receiving a ban because someone else interprets a nonexistent rule differently than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

In no way do I intend to disrespect evan or any of the Atlantis staff, but this ruling is wrong and the situation was dealt with poorly. I firstly had to decode why I was banned, and I'm lucky having been able to do that considering none of the staff responded, or I'm unable to even contact them. When I did receive the chance to represent myself, the initial argument for my ban was that I shot before storm rule, and then it was that I shot without being pressured by storm surge, and then it progressed into ""find\[ing\] an excuse"" and ""play\[ing\] aggro like an idiot"". I don't understand why I'm being banned, but even if my ban is settled, could I at least be provided an explanation by a set-in-stone rule so that I could avoid that situation in the future? To further my point, the precedent dealing of storm surge was to ignore zone rule after its appearance. I have vods on my channel that support this precedent.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I'm not terribly concerned with my ban, nor hold any grudges to the staff for their handling of the situation, rather I disagree with the difficulty of appealing a ruling as well as the lack of concrete evidence to back my ban. I did not even learn why I was banned before evan kindly approached me, something that the average player could not attain. After having learned why I was banned, my appeal was denied, to which I provided a counterargument--and the response was less than what I expected. It was handled based on opinion rather than fact, which should not be the standard for a server of this magnitude.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: i was banned, tried to appeal, my appeal was denied without good evidence

This is the main reason why they took siphon away from public matches. With an MMR system, this problem could be solved.

    A hidden MMR system works similarly to a ranked system, but is hidden and applies to all types of matches. Let me explain.

   The better you play, the more your MMR increases. MMR is a hidden rating, unique to all players. Players with similar MMR are matched against each other. In League of Legends, for example, both the ranked and unranked modes use MMR, but ranked puts limitations on it. I.E silver players cannot play against diamond tier players. In unranked games (commonly known as normal games), this limitation does not apply.

    So how can this be applied to Fortnite and why is it useful? Well, let me name a few reasons;

    - The MMR rating would probably be determined with the pop-up style system, taking into account placement and eliminations.

    - After enough time with the system, good players will only be placed against other good players, which means bad players can start having fun again.

    - Since it does not take your rank into account, a division 1 player with god tier pub stomping skills would only play with other good players.

    - If this system proves to be healthy for the game, siphon settings could be added again, as the community as a whole enjoyed playing with them.

    The only downside I see with this system is that it would increase queue times across the board, but if after implementation the queue times are not that bad, it could be a good fix to our problem.",FortniteCompetitive

I tried posting this many times before but sadly Epic didn't respond as the post didn't even get any engagements but since we are getting better communications now with Epic, I'll try once again so that I believe I did what I could.

Since, the v8.30 update, the game performance dropped really hard, and this is a personal problem, almost everyone had this problem. I'll split this post into several parts according to Game versions and whether it changed or not. I know asking for upvotes isn't allowed, but, please if you can help directing this to the staff, do it. I tried the in-game report options and I couldn't, and after I reached **Champion League** and tried to actually compete, it got ruined.

My PC specs will be posted below btw if it can help monitoring the problem, I cannot record since my PC hardly runs the game lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before v8.30:**

Average FPS was 40-60+ in **regular modes** and 30-50+ in **big-team modes** as they had many people building and etc.

60+ FPS with literally no drops in **Creative Mode**.

**After v8.30:**

There was something wrong with rendering, while I was in the bus, I had the normal FPS I always had, once I jump and get closer to the ground, render happens to show buildings and weapons so FPS drops to under 10, and doesn't go up again (it wasn't a temp. drop, it stayed between 10 and 20s)

**Important note**: Since 8.30, the CPU usage increased from 40% (approx.) to 80-90% (approx.)

**After v8.40:**

The performance was kinda improved, but still worse than **before 8.30** I had like 30-40 FPS instead.

""NoRHIThread"" that was written in the patch-notes helped decrease the CPU usage and improve the FPS but it is still unplayable.

&amp;#x200B;

**v8.50** had no more fixes for the issue, except adding an option for Multithread rendering which apparently replaces ""NoRHIThread"". But didn't *improve* the game performance.

The game was actually fun and playable before 8.30, I could really play. Now, I seriously started hating the game I loved the most. In today's **Unvaulting event** I had stable 8-15 fps due-to many people building when I used to have 40 (approx) in similar cases.

I know the post isn't a way to help, I am a web developer not a game developer so I am not sure what is causing these issues but all I can realize, the rendering system f\*\*\*ed up. I even have 40-50 FPS now in **Creative mode**. And if I am playing with many friends it reaches 10s.

So, please, if there is any more information I can share, please feel free to ask, I'll be glad to help you. Because you'll help be in return by fixing the game. I reached Champion League and liked playing Fortnite Competitively but now I only play like 30 minutes a day if I even play.

**PC Specs btw:**

* AMD Radeon HD 7470
* 8GB RAM DDR3
* Intel Xeon W3520

**Game Settings:**

* All on low
* 37% 3d resolution
* Multithread rendering turned off

Have you seen the video of a teacher saying ‚Äúwho here plays Fortnite?‚Äù And then like 10 or more kids start running and screaming ‚ÄúI play Fortnite!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe play Fortnite!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI love Fortnite! While all doing Fortnite dances? These are the kids that have voted for the drum gun. 

If you don‚Äôt remember what the drum gun is, or just straight up don‚Äôt know what it is. It is a tommy gun, and think of it like a hybrid of the SMG and the assault rifles in this game.  It comes in the green/uncommon rarity, and the blue/rare rarity. It uses medium ammo. It does 26/27 damage, had 50 bullets in the clip, shoots 9 bullets a second, and reloads in 3 seconds. 

Let‚Äôs say someone is standing in front of you, point blank, (so that you‚Äôre guaranteed to hit every bullet), it would take 0.33 seconds to kill you‚Äôre target if you only hit body shots and they were 100hp. The drum gun has one of, if not, the fastest time to kill out of any of the guns that are currently in battle Royale 

The drum gun starts or damage drop off when it is 3.5 tiles away and if I recall correctly, that‚Äôs 3.5 floors away. It does 70% of the usual damage after 3.5 tiles, and then 55% of its damage 5.5 tiles away. I AM NOT 100% SURE ABOUT THIS. The information found in the past paragraphs, I have found from the Youtuber Flamm, but the wiki says this about damage drop off, whereas in Flamm‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat is the best SMG in Fortnite?‚Äù Video, he says other things. He says that at 4 floors away, the blue drumgun does 27 damage, 8 walls away, 20 damage, and then the falloff maxes out at 10 floors away, and does 17 damage. 

The reason why this gun was picked, is because it takes zero skill. Little Timmy can pick up a drum gun and absolutely shred through everyone if he has these. I remember using it, and easily shredding through everyone and their builds. The problem is, now that everyone is a lot better compared to season 4, the bots aren‚Äôt actually going to be able to do well. I‚Äôm sorry if you picked it because you wanted to finally be able to be able to play well in this game, but you‚Äôre actually going to do worse. Really good players are going to use the drum gun and absolutely beam everybody in their path. Why? Because you can do well with it even if you can barely play, put it into the hands of someone who genuinely knows how to play this game well, (has over 100 wins, can easily get kills, doesn‚Äôt panic in top 5 etc.), and you‚Äôre going to get destroyed with it. I remember back in season 4 when one of my friends (who doesn‚Äôt play anymore), was reallllly bad, but was easily just w keyying (on controller LUL) and consistently getting over 5 kills, which was s big achievement for him to be completely honest. 

The biggest problem is, is that this gun was vaulted instead of nerfed for a reason. Firstly, you can‚Äôt decrease the damage on this gun because it uses medium ammo, it is completely stupid to make it match an smgs damage when it uses bigger bullets. It is stupid to reduce the clip size because it is a tommy gun and it HAS to have 59 billets in it. The fire rate currently isn‚Äôt even that high, the gun will feel incredibly clunky if the fire rate was decreased. Also, reload speed can‚Äôt really be increased either, because that would also make the gun feel clunky. Damage falloff can‚Äôt really be reduced as, once again, it uses medium ammo. It genuinely does not make sense to make the gun do the same damage as an SMG. There is really nothing Epic can do to nerf this gun, even though it desperately needs one. This gun is going to destroy Fortnite even more.

TL;DR: The drum gun is an ar/smg hybrid, it‚Äôs stupidly overpowered, it can‚Äôt really be nerfed, bots are gonna get destroyed, bye bye Fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

**Here is why Drum Gun is more balanced than Tactical Smg.**

- Tactical Smg great accuracy even at medium range, the bloom stays low even when spraying the whole mag and feels like there's no recoil. This can't be said for Drum Gun, the accuracy is really bad at anything than very close distance, the bloom gets higher over time when firing and theres a lot of recoil.

- Purple Tac Smg damage per second is 260, compred to 243 on Drum Gun

- Blue and Purple Tac smgs are hard to find, adding more rng. There is huge difference between each rarity. Drum Guns are more common and easy to get hands on, making more level field.

- Tac smg has fire rate of 13 wich means that there will be bullets slipping through turbo build like we saw with regular smg, but even more. This doesn't happen with drum gun since the fire rate is only 9.

Only thing Drum Gun beats Tactical Smg at is clearly longer lasting mag, becuse of higher mag size (50 vs 35) and lower rate of fire. Keep in mind that Tactical Smg has way shorter reload time, though.",FortniteCompetitive

However, the teams around us who also have to rotate aren‚Äôt doing anything either but whenever we start moving to rotate, they start spamming us. What i dont get is the fact that they also have to rotate but they just keep waiting and waiting trying to focus us and hope we rotate before them.

Any help on how to approach these situations?",FortniteCompetitive

People can't shoot them - why?

People don't have enough ammo, people won't waste ammo on 2 guys roaming around because if he peeks somebody else is on his ass.

So.. people get placement points just by being in the baller, not doing anything, fighting, rotating, building, and when you run out of materials - they get out and spam your weak state because you wasted everything.


I think people need to reconsider these baller thingies, they are overpowered and do not represent the skillset of 10 players who are in the endgame just bouncing around and grabbing points for nothing.

It just is not fair against people who actually are good and get kills/placement/rotations and stay low because they actually FOUGHT.

It is a competition to prove who is the best right? Not who can bounce more in the endgame.",FortniteCompetitive

Bad players if they play enough can get to the higher divisions. It shouldn‚Äôt be like that. The bad players need to stay in the lower division so they can play against people with their skill level. This would make it more fun for bad players to play.

I only like doing the Battle Royale when my friends are online and that only happens so often. I've seen a few posts saying the same thing, so I don't see why Epic just adds it up top. It would just take a minor update to switch the game mode screen and then throw some servers dovoted to the game type. I just want other peoples feedback in the hopes that everyone agrees and Epic does it. I think it would be a great addition to the game.",FortNiteBR

I agree with this and think stealth should be another tactic available and since the removal of the Shadow Stones I think it is time for a new item. 

Suggestion: Shhhoes

This item would be Purple rarity and drop in stacks of 4 (or scale to the amount of players in a party) to allow entire squads to use them simultaneously to infiltrate the enemy. They would completely remove all noises made by footsteps and jumping for 20 seconds. 

These would appear on your character for the duration of the effect and appear as some sort of clear/bubble looking footwear (if anyone wants to make a concept please feel free. 

Credit to my GF who thought of the idea and name, which I thought was pretty clever. I think this will add a new dimension to the game that isn’t as cheap as shadow stones, and still requires some planning to use. 

Feel free to add any suggestions or thoughts. ",FortNiteBR

I just wish Epic had a real ranked mode, slowed updates down and quit adding ridiculous stuff and focused on core gameplay and returning Fortnite to its original feel back in s3 or s2, even s4. I’m trying to play Fortnite not Battlefield 5.

Almost every game now, I’ll be farming materials for half of the entire time I’m alive. Then, now that everyone knows how to build/build battle I’ll come across a player who I’ll build battle for eternity. So the winner of this fight will be whoever runs out of mats first (unless your crazy good). When that person runs out of mats and loses the battle, the victor inherits no mats from his kill and then has to go farm mats AGAIN or a third party with mats will come in and finish you off. What I’m getting to here is that especially in the endgame and during build fights I’ll run out of materials and then regaining my hundreds of lost wood takes ages. I think that Epic should reduce the amount of material you get from farming by a lot, like 50% so that the game is more concentrated on PvP and less on building. When your build fighting its more about who has the most material, but with lower material on both sides will lead to people having to be more creative and hide behind natural cover instead of resorting to Builder Pro. Also you’ll have less planes breaking your builds because there’s less builds ;) Tell me your thoughts!",FortNiteBR

I saw that one person had a mic and was in game game chat talking. When I entered game chat I realized it was a dad teaching his son how to play.

The son was driving a plane and I got in my own and started protecting him. Two planes were both trying to kill him but I saved him by destroying both of them and the dad yelled,"" TEAMMATE TO THE RESCUE"". The kid started laughing and was going directly up into the sky. The dad was explaining to him about how if he doesn't have enough altitude he will fall down.

We both were shot and destroyed and I followed him on the ground. I turned my mic on and started to explain how to build and when he should build.  I then dropped him 4 boogie bombs and told him he needed them for a challenge.

The dad then messaged me, thanking me about helping his son and how he loves the bonding time with him. This was probably the most heart warming thing I've experienced on fortnite and I was glad to help him.

How do I help him see that it's his fault and he can learn from these mistakes?,"Like... He will get REALLY mad.

Earlier today he shottied someone down to 1 HP but they killed him. He started complaining that the game is ""So fucking stupid. This game is annoying."" I let it go that time and was like whatever I hear him say this shit all the time no worries.

But about 20 minutes later it happened again. He shottied a guy to 1 hp and died to that guy and he yells ""THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT! THIS IS WHY I HATE THIS FUCKING GAME, ALWAYS SOME DUMB BULLSHIT LIKE THAT!"" I just couldn't keep my mouth shut, although I stayed pretty chill.

I just said to him ""It's not the games fault you died."" and he gets upset and says ""Whatever dude, you just want to argue with me."" and I say ""It has nothing to do with arguing, but you can't blame the game for your own death. It's literally not the games fault."" and he hangs up the call on me and grumbles off all pissed...

Maybe I should always 100% ignore him and let him get pissed every time, but honestly, it stops him from getting better, and him being one of my main team mates, I want him to NOT stop playing and get better by learning from his mistakes.

How can I go about talking to someone like this and help him understand that every decision we make in the game is our own, and if my shotty hits for 99 and the enemies hits for 100, that's just the way of the road. I could have aimed better..

I don't know how to go about talking to this person to realize that they could improve so much more if they didn't blame the game all the damn time. He would log off less because he would be less upset, and in turn get more practice in and get better...

But all he does is get mad and 4-5 matches in he just leaves, every time.

I don't know a lot of other people that are online as much, which is why he's my main duo partner. If I had a more frequent one I'd play with them but I don't.

Any advice on how I could possibly approach this situation in a way that would help him see would be awesome!",FortNiteBR

There's very few downsides to using the planes; Perfect for rotations and third-partying, you can freely spray and ram into people with it while taking zero damage. If the plane is about to explode you can just jump out and dive straight onto people.

I constantly spend alot of time searching for players and as soon as I find them and engage there's 1, 2 or even 3 planes just flying straight into me and it's extremely hard to counter and just really annoying. Does anyone feel the same? I get how it can be fun to use them but as long as you're on the ground it's just a terrible experience for me. Sure they are good for the rotation aspect of the game but does there really need to be a machine gun attached to the plane? And how come you take zero damage while ramming 200km/h into the ground while the player you're hitting takes damage? I feel like there's too many positive aspect and too few negative ones, thanks for reading!",FortNiteBR

     Just wanted to say something that i wish I was told when i was 12 or so...As time passes on, the people around you **will** change. Your best friends now *may* be different in a week or a year. Your responsibilities will change. One day you are playing fortnite after class, the next you might not have the same time to do so because something just a *little* bit more important is taking its place. But the magic of video games is something not everyone gets a chance to really understand. Odds are, if you are reading this and you are an adult like me (im 26 but really im a kid.....) Then you have had a chance to fall in love with the magic of video games and the culture around it.) Just remember to always be yourself and learn to share that magic with your friends and new people you meet! Share a smile and be kind to one another. Enjoy these moments, the skins, the emotes, the victory's ! The LTM's etc..try and really appreciate the way you play today because is important to feel these levels of joy video games can bring especially when young, that can define who we are later. 

     I will always love the joy that Fortnite and video games bring about and hope that you will remember to share that passion with others and most importantly and the true reason i made this: 

     Don't let anyone make you feel bad for enjoying what you enjoy. No matter how old you are, how you look, Or who you hang out with.. Don't let anyone discourage you from being you and doing what makes you happy. 


     Have a great holiday and I hope you really took the time to say thank you to every person that gave you gifts. Especially ones that you **really** wanted. 

**Happy holidays everyone!**",FortNiteBR

Does anyone else feel the same way? I still like the game and some of the stuff it's been doing, but it just doesn't have that thing of being fun. 

I will genuinely sit in the lobby for over an hour just thinking if I should play or not, or gatherinf up the energy to even play, and when I do, it's so boring. I just get the battlepass as a means to play the game and achieve something so it's not as boring, but even that is drying out.

I normally pay in Euro (though I live in Switzerland where we have Swiss Francs but whatever...) and now I am on Poland where they pay in Zloty. I noticed that the 10000 + 3500 V-Bucks Package is about 7% cheaper in Polish Currency than it is in Euroland.

&amp;#x200B;

The 500 V-Bucks plus Starter Skins is only 15 Zloty (3.50 Euro) while it costs 4.99 Euro in Euroland.

&amp;#x200B;

1000 V-Bucks costs 39 Zloty (9.10 Euro) while they cost 9.99 Euro in Euroland. That's a saving of about 9%.

There exists such an overview about different prices for spotify on [http://mts.io/projects/spotify-pricing/](http://mts.io/projects/spotify-pricing/). Maybe we can create a similar list for Fortnite and V-Bucks prices. :-)

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to contribute post the follow:

&amp;#x200B;

My country:

My currency: 

1000 V-Bucks price in your country's currency (in Euro):

10000 + 3500 V-Bucks price in your currency (in Euro):

5000 V-Bucks + Skin Starter Pack in your currency (in Euro):

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

My country: Poland

My currency: Zloty

1000 V-Bucks price in your country's currency (in Euro): 39 Zloty (9.99 Euro)

10000 + 3500 V-Bucks price in your currency (in Euro): 399.00 Zloty (99.99 Euro)

5000 V-Bucks + Skin Starter Pack in your currency (in Euro): 15 Zloty (3.50 Euro)

&amp;#x200B;

In order to get the conversation into Euro just type ""x Currenty in Euro"" into Google and press enter. E.g., 50 Zloty in Euro.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your help.

So in the current state of Fortnite, almost everyone uses the 'triangle edit' or the 'arch edit' to get out of their builds.

I feel like the door edit needs a buff of some kind to viable in the current meta.

I was thinking that it cool if the person who owns the build have access to the door. In other words, we and our team-mates would be the only players who would be able to open the door.

This would make presetting doors in walls viable (like Ceeday used to do). 

I'd like to hear what others think of this change.

People say it’s worse than S5 and onward, but that just seems so wrong to me. Sure, the game has a lot more content now, but I feel like Season 4 still held that original Fortnite feel in it. The continuation of the sci-fi theme instantly made me fall in love with it, and the only real big changes was dusty being destroyed and a couple tiny craters, but nothing huge.

Honestly, the game was simple and chill back then. Everyone hates it for being “boring”, when the game was just peaceful. I think now the game is in a lot better shape competitively, and I love S7 a ton, I just think S4 doesn’t get enough credit as it is. I’m curious as to why you guys dislike the season, and I’m being genuine here, I’d love to hear it! I’m personally a sucker for super hero/sci-fi shit, so I’m a bit biased aesthetically haha.",FortNiteBR

i know i could have just edited out but it's pretty easy to re-adjust the plane to still kill me so i don't think that's a viable  way to avoid dying the way i did.

-Literally no counter
-Extra counter to building
-Too common
-Too much health
-Too fast
-Takes too little damage when crashing (lowers the skill required to pilot it)
-Too little explosion damage taken to pilot when shot down
-Too overused and common in end-game
-Plane turret should take your ammo when used (to further stop spamming)

Here is what I think can be done to mitigate this issue:

-Boost does not pass through buildings
-One Plane spawns per hangar or spawn location as opposed to three
-Plane should have 200-300 health
-Plane should take damage in storm
-Plane's speed should be nerfed to sprinting speed at MOST
-When plane explodes, an explosion is made within a 1 block radius and should be instakill to pilot
-Less health a plane has it should be harder to control

Many players also want the refunds to be able to refund items from the past 3-5 months for a limited time (Maybe like 3 days).

I dont know how or when digital items became comparable to real world but I'm baffled that we are actually going to have people out there that think like this. 

But if you are one of those individuals I have a great deal for you. For half the cost of what ever you want in life I'll send you a digital copy of it. Make sure to choose what color you want tho because as you know I'll need a second payment for any color differences.  And AT NO COST TO YOU I'll send you a picture of your favorite food everyday to fill you up for lunch!!!  

Bottom line is Epic is doing fine. They dont NEED any of this for server maintenance or maintaining or upgrading infrastructure.   They've made enough to sit happy for a long time.    Rereleasing reskin skins is just a slap in the face.  Legendary  skins could easily be given retroactive styles on their skins to make them more ""worth it""  And by adding that it would make more sense to one purchase things in the future for the possibility that more item might be gifted from that purchase.

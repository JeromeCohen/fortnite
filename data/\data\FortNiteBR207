I understand when you’re switching between builds you have to double tap to place it down unless it’s already selected. One of my friends says he never double taps and abuses turbo building by just holding down whatever he wants to build. For example, when he does a floor ramp wall push, instead of double tapping everything he just holds it and lets turbo building do everything. I’m just curious if a lot of other builder pro players do the same. Also, is it a bad habit to learn for a new builder pro user, especially if turbo building gets nerfed one day?

There’s is a latency delay. So your crosshairs can be directly on the target when you pull the trigger, and despite being close range and all pellets being hit, you will still do low damage due to latency. This is completely out of human control. Until Epic invents servers with 0 ping, you cannot truly get the best out of a shotgun. This is why SMGs will beat shotguns in their current state, it’s RNG and consistent damage across the board.

Another weapon we’ve all said “Idk how I didn’t hit him, my crosshairs were directly on him, that’s bs” is the scoped AR and Thermal AR. Again, you can pull the trigger when your crosshairs are directly on them, and no fault to you or your skill but you will miss sometimes because there is latency.

Saying “aim better” is a terrible argument.

Either buff the damage or invent servers with zero ping.",FortNiteBR

The amount of kids commenting on instagram is insane. Tens of thousands on each leak post.

The majority of the theories I read have very weak evidence and it reminds me of when I was 10 years old. We had theories for finding the triforce in Ocarina of Time, or the masamune blade in FF7 and we spent months ruminating trying to piece it all together. It would lead nowhere but it was all good fun. This is why I can't knock these theories too much, I know it's fun, it's just extremely evident that most of these are written by kids.

Then there's the more annoying, distasteful side of the game being mostly populated by kids; the skin wars, the idolizing of no skins and the inability for kids to think for themselves or appreciate their own tastes instead of blindly following whatever the top streamers like. Seeing how many people line up to see what the BP skins are or what skins just got added to the shop. There's no way that Fortnite isn't severely affecting kid's grades these days, lmao.",FortNiteBR

24,GrimeBrine,1537891486,9itflq,39,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9itflq/shotguns_will_never_be_buffed_until_weapon/,22,Shotguns will never be buffed until weapon swapping is changed. It by-passes all of the weapons intended weaknesses.,"Let's go over what the weapons intended weaknesses are supposed to be. 

Pump Shotgun - High single shot damage potential, but its drawback is that it has to be pumped. That brief moment is where the shotgun is supposed to be falling short. Weapon swapping destroys that weakness. 

Tactical Shotgun - Fires fast with a larger clip, but it has a noticeably shorter range than you can expect from a pump.

Heavy Shotgun - Attempts to bridge the gap between both the pump and tactical by increasing range to slightly past pump level, and increasing fire rate.

Double-Barrel - This is the one closest to what you should expect from a shotgun that doesn't need to be buffed, though The Grappler is what is alleviating the weapons intended weakness of very short range. We still see weapon swapping when the shells have been unloaded covering up its other weakness of having low magazine capacity. Knowing that my opponent has a double-barrel has often given me the information that I need to get out of his optimal range, and keep it that way. I understand how to play around it properly, even if it's not always possible. It's dangerous. But this is counter-play, and it's incredibly important to any player versus player game.


Now, I've asked quite a number of people, watching streams, my friend/play group, and even randoms in fill lobbies I've joined. **Everyone says the same thing, they don't want to lose weapon swapping mid fight.** Some even went as far as to say that they'd quit if weapon swapping was removed. While it's definitely not that big a deal with building in the game, I understand why people feel that way. **It's been in the game since the beginning, how could they remove it.** What was meant for a PvE experience that blended into a PvP experience after we as a community have gotten used to it and learned to play with and around it. How could they remove it even if it's bad for the game and gunplay?

You might argue that slot management is important, but almost everyone (that has learned the game/meta) is defaulting to running:

*1. Shotgun 
*2. a close combat spray/follow up weapon
*3. A specialty weapon IE: Sniper/Explosives
*4. An assault rifle
*5. Healing/shielding

It's not a choice being made anymore, but a given.

Tl;dr Epic **cannot buff shotguns** because other weapons cover their weaknesses and a *core game mechanic is at fault*. Weapon swapping needs to go if you want stronger shotguns and to stop seeing 7's from that pump blast. (Though that's mostly just your bad aim)",FortNiteBR

Silencer pistol: I thought adding hit scan accuracy would help so it can be used at a range. The problem with this weapon is if you use it someone against you will use a powerful non silenced weapon. That makes the purpose of it being silenced

kind of useless. Some people say this weapon is still good. It can kill very well at close range and I have used this weapon and have successfully. However it is weaker than many other weapons so it's not so great. It's just outmatched.

Silenced smg: now I suggested this being removed because it's silencer is almost unusable. Like the pistol it is a close range weapon making the silencer a not so useful add on.. The only thing it has over the regular smg is less bullet consumption (can actually use a mag in 3.3ish seconds while regular does like 2.5 sec) witch is good but not a proper silencer. Good weapon but silencer is pretty weak.

Crossbow: I think epic missed out on an opportunity with this weapon. It is a ranged silence weapon and I have explained already silencers are much more usefull at range. But at the time it's damage was the same as the current semi auto. If it did hunting rifle damage and maybe had lower rarity it could be an amazing weapon to silently kill opponents. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point I'm trying to make here is that silencer weapons need range. If you kill an opponent with a silenced smg then someone else will just follow the sound of the guy shooting you. At range though they can't really find you as easily. Please comment like normal human being rather than wining like a 12 year old.

FPS completely tanks and the server is lagging so hard that most people are teleporting. Just had a game where the circle was in loot lake and the server froze for 10 whole seconds and no one even knew what was going on. These are the main reason why so many players stay away from this gamemode. Even if it is considered casual, still not being able to play because of server lag and constant FPS drops doesn't sound very appealing. A thing to note is that this doesn't happen all the time, but still it is how most 50 vs 50 games go. I actually like this gamemode because it allows you to jump in groups of enemies and it let's you train how to survive when you are in a 1 vs 5 or more,. but honestly I don't see much of a reason to play it in its current state. Surprisingly, when 50 vs 50 first came out, the servers were actually much more stable, I don't know why the servers right now are so much worse. Probably because of the larger player base but eh who knows.",FortNiteBR

Map has about 20-30% visibility with fog covering all areas of the map, street lights and signs in Tilted Retail Salty and etc flicker on and off you know like in scary movies 

100 player Battle Royale like always except when you die a tombstone gets place on the floor where you died, however since most people leave the match immediately after they die this gamemode is a bit different 

You can either sit and wait or you can spectate another player in the meanwhile but once the storm passes over your tombstone you transform into a husk or EPIC can implement some sort of overlay texture on your skin to give a ghost or zombie like appearance 

As a husk/ zombie player, you have *300 health* (anything in astrics can be changed to make it more balanced) in the storm you regenerate health and *move 2X as fast as a normal player*, once the husk or zombie leaves the storm these effects are negated and go back into effect once they re-enter

You and all other dead players are a “team” as in you can’t hurt each other but only live players 

The husk/zombie’s players goal is to melee damage the living/buildings of live players in order to get revenge/ speed up the game 

Once there is one player left alive, the storm is removed from the entire map, all dead/ husk players are set to 100 Heath only  must try to eliminate the last living player and the living player must eliminate all husk players 

If the living player defeats all 99 husk he receives 2X XP for the match 

If the Husk army wins they get 50v50 amount of XP 
But the husk player who actually defeats the last living player gets slightly more XP than the rest

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing fortnite ""actively"" since this season but I was playing on and off since season 3. Right now my KD is around 2.5 or something like that, over 100 wins (most of them squads though), but it's all due to outsmarting players who play too rash or by fighting people who aim even worse than me.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't consider myself a good player: I don't built incredibly good, my AR and shotgun aim is terrible (my snipe is pretty nice though), I'm just very good at waiting for other players to mess up during fights. I disengage and engage very easily and most of the time I'm in control of the build fights.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried ""aiming exercises"" that focus on muscle memory and such, but nothing seems to work. My aim is always pretty terrible in comparisson to other players.

Back in Season 4, we were introduced to the Omega skin, along with the Carbide skin, in which we were forced to grind very hard to completely max out. You had to reach level 80, no less, to unlock it with customisation. If you didn't spend a penny over $10 on the game (most basic Battlepass) it required grinding throughout the whole season, and is a showcase for the level of skill in which a player had that season, and how much they were determined to play the game to earn the skin they wanted. 

Now, they're saying you can still earn the max Ragnarok in 100 season's time, it doesn't matter. Same goes for the Drift; in my honest opinion it's practically a joke. There's nothing exclusive for the dedicated, and high level players any more. Nothing that indicates ""I've grinded my arse off this entire season, and have this to show for it."" It was nice to have Max Ragnarok, around Week 7 when not everyone had it, but has since gone pointless, especially considering anyone who maxed out the Battlepass by doing the challenges and playing every once in a while will earn it. 

It's a damn shame. ",FortNiteBR

If we implemented the option for one random player to choose where the final circle lies, I think we'll have many more unique end games than just the simple ""peg everyone off from the highest tower"" way about it that many are prone to doing when the circle ends up more centered. 

There are some rounds where we get an ""inconvenient circle"" and I relish in the challenge and enjoy seeing-- especially with the port-a-fortress, what is capable of happening when the score gets down to 12v9 in the far corner of Risky Reels, in a circle that is half ocean.

The Double Barrel is just way too strong when you are actually close to the person. It’s able to kill someone with 200 health in less than 2 seconds. Building is a good counter to it but if they are in your 1x1, what can you possibly do? It’s another type of gun like the smg that doesn’t require skill. The huge spread makes it easy to hit someone without having to really aim. This weapon has been borderline obnoxious for me ever since it was added. Nobody tries to build battle me anymore, they simply jump right onto me and press the right trigger twice.

My conclusion,
I wouldn’t say it has to be vaulted but it deserves a big nerf. After all, it was supposed to replace the double pump so why does each shot hit for 100+? The damage should be lowered to like 80 but have a greater range to make it more like a viable weapon. I hope Epic takes my idea into consideration.

Correct me if I remember anything wrong, but there was a leak before Season 5 started that said a couple things...

-Moisty Mire will be destroyed.

-The season will be time/history themed.

-There will be a time machine in Moisty Mire.

Moisty Mire is obviously gone. I don't need to go over that.

Season 5 wasn't time-themed, but Season 6 may be.

Think about it. The Llama DJ appears to be a robot (I mean, we can only see the hands and head, but I have nothing else to work with), and I saw another theory that Season 6 will be future-themed, and Dark Bomber is just Brite Bomber in the future, turned evil. There isn't a ton of evidence for this, but it could definitely be the case.

So this means the cube can see into the future. It's like a portal into the future, or a time machine. On top of this, it started in ~~Paradise Palms~~ Moisty Mire.

We haven't seen the past through the cube, but if it's a time machine anything could happen.

My guess is that because the cube mixed with the water, it created a sort of portal. We may not be able to go into it, but who's to say something couldn't come out of it? Stuff from the future, maybe.

Also, a quick Google search tells me that gravity can affect time. The stronger the gravity, the slower time goes. This could tie in with the low-gravity areas, perhaps.

Lastly, this is only loosely related, but I'll never have another time to mention it. Since Tomatohead went back into the past and got a sort-of Aztec makeover, and he came back with a Temple, what if Beef Boss goes into the future and Greasy Grove gets a cyberpunk makeover?

**TL;DR: Season 5 leaks said rip Moisty and that Moisty would house a time machine, Kevin is the time machine and Season 6 will be time-themed like the leak said 5 would be.**

it works like this:
100 players are thrown into the island, for this mode the storm will shrink faster. 

when you encounter a player (by getting within 10 meters of them), you automatically challenge them to a dance off, in which you have to gather the most ""style points"" in order to win.

how do you get them? by dancing! 
each dance can be found as a book, which cointain the instructions to do the move. they range from common to leggendary, and the rarer it is, the bigger the amount of points you get when you perform it. you can have a max amount of 5 moves, like the weapons in normal mode.

 however, when you dance battle, you don't just click the emote and it does it's thing automatically. you have to perform a series of inputs and commands in order to perform the dance moves. the rarer they are to find, the harder they are to perform.

 when you start a dance off, you'll both have 3 turns to show off your moves and gather the most points. at the end, the loser gets eliminated in a stilish way, and the winner gets a kill, or point.

in the final fases, if there aren't 2 dancers left, the two with the most points are left, and the others are automatically eliminated.

the last two dancers are automatically teleported to Loot Lake, where the Llama dj rises with his mixers and dj stuff. 
this is the final battle, and it will last 5 turns long with a x2 score multiplier. 

in the end, who wins plays a special victory emote, which will be an event emote obtainable by winning in the mode enough times. kind of like the crowbar for the Jewel mode.

any ideas to improve this? thanks for reading.

A purchase-able advent calendar, maybe similar to the Battle Pass price wise (950/1000 V-Bucks) or more depending what items Epic would decide to put in it.

But each day leading up to Christmas you get a daily Advent Calendar challenge, once you complete that daily challenge you get the reward for that day. Ending up with 25 rewards. Could be a good way to incorporate Christmas Emotes, Banners, Christmas Styled Beach Balls etc.. The 25th of December's reward could be like a Male Santa Character or something.

Just an idea I had but so open to criticism and would love to see any other ideas you guys have regarding it :)

Which results in FSA becoming unreliable, long-range shots way harder to land and an overall hindered experience. We've had to stick with it for this long and we still have no choice but to play with a bugged reticle.  


Here are LOTS of ingame screenshots that show the issue : [https://imgur.com/a/osBt62aH](https://imgur.com/a/osBt62a)  
Here is a comparative that shows the difference : [https://imgur.com/a/KEffnRO](https://imgur.com/a/KEffnRO)  


Explanations about this at the end of the post.  


Long ago I reported it in the official forums : r/https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/592790-no-middle-dot-crosshair

&amp;#x200B;

This was 47 days ago now : r/http://howmanydayssince.net/08/08/2018

&amp;#x200B;

I and other users bumped this topic several times.

&amp;#x200B;

I and probably other users reported it several times ingame.

&amp;#x200B;

It was then answered...But it was completely misunderstood apparently. I was asked if this was a similar issue than this one : r/https://trello.com/c/VrRl8Mha/234-crosshair-and-fov-can-be-blocked-when-aiming-down-sight ...It has CLEARLY nothing to do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's now STILL not listed on the community issues page : r/https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues

&amp;#x200B;

So apparently, everything I did was not enough despite the customer support for the bug report section can not answer directly and redirects us to...the official forums, where this issue, again, has been posted 47 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried to post it here because I see that issues that are listed on the community issues page tend to be linked to a reddit thread. It was deleted because apparently it belonged to bug megathreads. Even tho, at the time, it was already like this for several weeks, which means the last bug report megathread didn't correspond to the patch that introduced the bug. But anyway I posted it on SEVERAL patch Bug report megathreads, Day one, like 2 hours after they were created. All my posts remained ignored as well and worse, downvoted for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I came to the conclusion that pretty much 90% of the people who don't experience this don't UNDESTAND the issue. They seem to think that WE are mistaken and don't understand that the reticle has changed.  


Again, I want to clarify things. Yes, I acknowledge that the reticle was changed 47 days ago or something like that. It now appears smaller etc and many people seem happy about it. I would probably be as well if I had a chance to try the regular one.  


However, if for many people it changed normally, for is it didn't. OUR reticle is NOT how it is SUPPOSED to be. AND it's way way worse.  


So to make sure EVERYONE understands for once and people stop saying that it's not a bug, or whatever, I took screenshots from Youtube videos that are recent enough (When the reticle had already changed) and put them next to how my reticle looks ingame. Note that the screenshots that correspond to a regular reticle come from Youtube which means it doesn't look as clear as it looks ingame. But despite that it can clearly be seen that the middle dot is MORE visible in screenshots taken from vids on Youtube than in screenshots taken directly from the game in the highest quality possible.",FortNiteBR

He experiments with rifts and can travel to other dimensions. The enforcers know it’s against the law, so they banish the visitor to the fortnite dimension in season 4 and he plots to use a rocket to escape. He succeeds, but the enforcers know so later they jail the visitor in the cube, and the crack in the fortnite world goes away. They’re sending the cube to loot lake where the cube will melt along with the visitor. The cube places runes to lighten the cube to move faster. The visitor tampers with the cube so when it reaches loot lake, it does melt, but the visitor stays alive. Similar to fish swimming under a lake of ice, the visitor is under the bounciness of the lake, plotting his next escape. Season 6’s theme is going to be futuristic/cyberpunk. Time travelers from the future will come to the present to protect the world. Maybe “Dead11ama”, the skin in the first teaser, is the leader.

Recently as of patch v5.4.1 my account was disabled for no discernable reason. I've tried contacting epic and I keep getting in the automated loop of BOT's telling me to change my password or enable Two Factor Authentication.

When I finaly got to an Epic employe I asked them the reason for the ban and they responded with ""Suspicious Behaviour"" I have no idea what this means do they suspect me of cheating or fraud? Because that's the reasons it gives me when attempting to sign back in.

It's approaching a week without Fortnite and I considered giving in. I made a second account and logged on. No skin no progress nothing all gone my collection, everything gone. I load into a lobby ready to play I had missed the game so kuch I was desperate to play only to find that I was immediately sent back to the lobby and told that my PC was also banned. I felt so frustrated and sad I logged off nearly uninstalled but I couldn't bring my self to do it I didn't want to quit.

Today I'm still banned and don't have a clear response on why. Many people on this sub also seem to be suffering from the VPN/Proxy Server message kicking them from their games and I'm not the only one to be banned as a result of this. With season 6 swiftly approaching I hope Epic can fix these issues and I hope that I will be able to join in the fun again.

I just miss playing so much :(

I'm not really sure why, but after a while, something just sort of clicked, and I was doing stuff and hitting shots I wouldn't have been able to before. And since then I feel like I've been improving much much faster and I feel much more confident in my skills than I was before. And most importantly, I am having so much more fun than I was before. I still play semi-passively just so I can get wins but I have a lot more fun than I used to just cause I played aggressive once. Have any of you had a similar experience?",FortNiteBR

Because this season goes through Halloween, and the anniversary of Battle Royale, all the characters are having a massive costume party (celebrating Halloween, the anniversary, or both) the djay of this party is the llama in the 1rst teaser, and that is his costume.
 As time goes on somehow or another the dark Brite Bomber from the loading screen appears (maybe from the lake or something like that)
She plans to cause chaos, likely by turning the world into the dark version she is used to
She goes to the party to start her plan, but everyone just thinks that it's just Brite Bombers costume for the party, and they unknowingly party with her, ruining her plan in the process

TLDR; Halloween costume party, dark bomber appears, everyone thinks its brite bombers costume

Due to being evenly matched with everyone, you cannot have fun and wins. You'll either be wiped out at the POI you dropped or at the end by the best of the 100. Because more often than not the skill gap between the two will be quite wide.

You could obviously argue that 50v50 is exactly the place for that, but after a few games , it becomes repetitive. You can only do so much.

In normal solos you'll avoid battles to get to the final one, because rarely will you find an equally skilled player and have a fun battle.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my opinion from the POV of a casual player. I am no no-skin, I've been playing since the early days, but just want to  have some fun instead of grinding out building and shotgun skills.",FortNiteBR

387,NotAlek11,1537813447,9ikftt,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ikftt/my_theory_about_stone_head_statues_and_the_future/,16,My Theory About ''Stone Head Statues'' And The Future Seasons,"Before i begin with the theory, i just wanna go through some history of the statues.They were added at the beginning of season 5.There is 7 of them, and around all of these are some rifts and chests.You can see all of their locations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/97s57e/week_6_tip_search_where_the_stone_heads_are/).

&amp;#x200B;

So, the first thing we got to know about them is that they are all looking at Salty Springs by this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90u27r/the_stone_heads_are_all_looking_towards_salty/).And as most of you probably know is that there is a secret basement in the mint house in Salty Springs that was added at the beginning of season 4, you can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8g9gxw/secret_basementbunker_in_salty_springs/).So there we can find some kind of an underground lab.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i think that at the end of season 5, all the places where statues were located will just have piles of rocks with one chest one them.And then you will be able to find parts of statues in the basement in Salty Springs.Through the season 6 they will start forming into something, someone will do it, like a crazy scientist or something, it can even be a skin, like this idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8myiq0/new_mad_scientist_skin_idea/).

&amp;#x200B;

After they form something in the basement, it will start going out of the basement, also i think it should take until the week 7, then it will just leave a huge statue hovering over the mint house in Salty Springs.It will have runes on itself like or old friend Kevin had, you can see them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9dzpoi/kevins_big_plan_with_3_correctlyoriented_runes_1/).You will be able to break it for a lot of materials, but every week it will get more health and it will spawn a chest around itself.And if it gets out by week 7 that should make 3 more changes to the statue with the rest of the following weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the first day of season 7, Salty Spring becomes Sacred Springs, like a city from an ancient civilization, like something that happened to Tomato Town when it became Tomato Temple which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/99m36z/tomato_temple/).And it has stone statues around it, the basement is still there and is the only part of the Sacred Springs that didn't change.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone actually is still reading to this point, or just skipped to this point, i wanna sum it up.All statues are looking towards Salty Springs, they all get destroyed and brought to the basement in Salty Springs, they create a giant statue that destroys Salty Springs and transform it into Sacred Springs.Anyways, thanks for reading, comment your thoughts on the theory and what could i add to it, goodbye!

Not to mention the amount of kills you can get in duos/squads compared to solos. You tell me whats better, 4 kills or 1. Solos also have a slow midgame, and with rifts reportedly being removed, its going to be even slower. In solos, you get 1 chance, which imo is very VERY lame. And in squads, if you are soloing, and die, its because you were outnumbered most of the time, whereas in solos, you often die because another person intrudes and kills you, or even steals your kill.

In my opinion if team members are reasonably close to a downed player then finishing off should be removed or restricted, especially in pre made teams 

It would be much better if all items in one's inventory drop if the enemy require to use them in the rest of the fight

I loved season 4 double pump, and didn’t think it was overpowered, but I realize that it will probably never come back. So I have come up with a solution. (Not sure if anyone has had this idea before but I’ve never seen it on here).

Ok so you know the mechanic in the Close Encounters LTM with jetpacks where you pick one up and if you already have one in your inventory it will replace your first jet pack, regardless of whether or not it is the only thing that you are carrying. 

So, my proposal is why not just apply this same mechanic to shotguns, with a few exceptions. With this, the shotgun delay timer would have to be removed.

You could never carry two of the same shotgun, so double pump/heavy/DB wouldn’t be possible, but combinations like pump-tac, heavy-pump, heavy-tac, would be possible. The mechanic would work the same as jetpacks, and if you were already carrying one pump or heavy, etc, it would just drop the one you are carrying and replace it.

The exception to this though is the DB, I think that if you are carrying a DB you can carry any other type of shotgun.

WEAPON CHANGES

SMGs-silenced is in a great place. Leave it alone Epic. Normal SMG is slightly OP, give it a small nerf maybe make the crosshair increases in size as you fire it and maybe lower structure damage. P90, make it a bit rarer of a drop rate, otherwise it’s in a okay place right now. LMG, vault that shit.

AR are in a okay place right now. Lower bloom on auto shot maybe. Also maybe slightly reduced the time it takes for burst first shot accuracy to reset. Otherwise fine. Leave suppressed SCAR alone Epic. 👀

Shotguns. This is a big one. In short slightly nerf the double barrel, heavy and tacs are fine. Remove pump pullout delay but don’t bring back double pump. Make it possible to one pump with a well executed headshot, but all pellets must land on head. 

Splodes. RPG, make it legendary only and exclusive to supply drops. Grenade launcher, nerf fire rate slightly and damage down to 80-90 and remove blue version of it. Lower chance of rocket ammo spawning out of crates. Slightly lower structure damage.

Otherwise other weapons are balanced right now.

MAP CHANGES

Ok so here’s what I hope from season 6 map changes. 

Loot lake turns into a dark dimension portal, the surrounding area turns into a dark world area. Half of tilted is changed into a dark, destroyed version. Thought the season this destroyed version of tilted is knocked down, halving tilted making it a more balanced spot. Flush factory is turned into mitalry base. Tanks slowly drive from here throughout the season to Viking village and turn it into a sort of Area 51 place. Villain base gets vandalised. Motel undergoes construction and by the end of the season it’s a hotel. Wailing woods is turned into a theme park with a concert and chicken based restaurant.

STORYLINE

Loot lake activated and turned into a dark dimension portal. Multiple evil themed skins are released. The tier 1 and tier 100 skins final unlockable style is a evil version of it. The newly teased llama isn’t a tier 1 or tier 100 skin, but is in the battle pass. THE FOLLOWING IS BASED IF SOME LEAKS. The guy in the bunker came out and followed his dream and built a chicken restaurant. Mascot skin called Tender Defender (please Epic) and slowly the place turns into a huge amusement park with a concert and a party will be held there mid-season hence new teased skin.

Everyone right now is bouncing around loot lake and because (technically) we are now the size of bullets (due to the surface area of the lake) that it's building up all the pressure of everyone bouncing on the lake because releasing a massive explosion.

Season 1-3 double pump
 *common pumps do 209 headshot damage 
* the only guns people use up close are pumps

That meta was a little bad not gonna lie, but pumps take  skill to use so it wasn’t that bad

Season 4 double pump 
* Pumps have been nerfed from 209 headshot damage to 170 headshot damage
* double pump is balanced 
* all other shotgun combinations are just as good

Best state of the game imo. Most combinations were good, pumps were balanced etc

season 5 pump
* double pump isn’t a thing anymore
* smgs are really powerful now
* game isn’t fun for some players 

They messed up here, pumps take a lot more skill than smgs do, double pump was fun while pump+smg isn’t fun

What are you’re thoughts?

I have to admit, i have been pushed away from the game here and there but I do still think its an amazing game.

I dont think that the problem with the game is the introduction of NEW metas, but rather the lack of time allowed for players to ADJUST to new metas. 

Sure, some amazing players might just grab a grapple gun and go to town with a Double Barrel. But some other people that may not be as good before the update and cant play as much, might struggle to notice the new meta, know how to take advantage of it, or protect themselves from it.

I think the new items they add really do add a lot to the game, but the problem may be that they are adding too much in too little time. They just threw in Rifts, double barrels, compact smgs, heavy snipers, grapple guns, port a fortresses, OP slurps, silenced scars, changed building dynamics, zero gravity zones, and a bouncy pad loot lake seemingly all at once (for people who dont play as frequently as others) and the changes seem to have broken the game for those players that at one time played a lot getting many wins with the old metas but now cant play as often.

This is something i have struggled with having a job and other good games that I play, where when i come back to Fortnite, the game is nearly unrecognizable. I dont think it ""being a bad game"" is what is pushing people away, but rather that it ""is a completely different game than the one we used to binge play"" in the earlier seasons.

TL;DR
The new metas arent the problem, but rather the lack of time to adjust to the new metas for players that dont only play fortnite. They cant play as much and the game seems unrecognizable when they come back to play.",FortNiteBR

It keeps all Jonseys and other noobs safe, it’s a legendary item yet the people always get it which leads me to my main point we need a counter. Personally I was thinking a automatic missile that will seek out the nearest bushman and blow ‘em up.

These noobs always walking around like they own the place I mean you can literally finish a 10v1 then build a little 1x1 to use a well deserved medkit and there will just be a wild noob waiting to kill you with their pickaxe.




Side note: I can’t wait for 50v50 to end because I would like to start seeing noobs back in Solos/Squads because atm everyone is just a pro",FortNiteBR

The SMG meta was horrible, the weapons were overpowered and bad. The map changes can stay though, certain ones were good. I just think they should combine seasons 3 and 6, with the old factories, Moisty Mire, and Dusty Depot. We should keep Dusty Diner though.

To progress to the next location the same mission apears. And you guessed it, launch the rocket. From stonewood to plankerton, you have to literally launch a huge rocket same as plankerton to canny vally, and the. Again to twine peeks. Fortnite devs already confirmed they have been teasing the next season  and that the week 8 loading screen was a teaser. In the leaked photo of the week 8 loading screen the new blockbuster skin is standing in front of the rocket. There is only one other reference to a rocket in the game that is fortnite.

Epic Games updated the online FAQ regarding cross progression on the 4th. In its current state here is what it says: 

&gt;*Q: If I play Fortnite Battle Royale on PS4, do I still have access to all my items and will my progression still count across PC and Mac?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*A: Yes. As long as you’ve connected your PS4 account to your Epic Games account, any purchased content and progression you’ve acquired is accessible across PS4, PC and Mac.*  


* However, using the internet wayback ""time machine"" I found the previous FAQ Q&amp;A, dated February 28th:

&gt;*Q: If I buy Fortnite on PS4, can I play on PC/Mac?* ***Are my items and progression cross-platform?***  
&gt;  
&gt;*A: As long as you have your PSN account linked to an Epic account, you will also be able to play on PC and/or Mac.*  ***Your items and progression will be available cross-platform****.*    
&gt;  
&gt;***Furthermore, playing Fortnite on Playstation 4 will lock your Epic Account to the PS4 and PC platforms****. This means that you will not be able to play Fortnite on Xbox One while logged into that same Epic Account.*  
&gt;

* Why is this noteworthy? Well, there are a few reasons:

1. Epic did not warn PS4 users their accounts would be locked to the PS4, unable to be used on the Switch. Why did they choose to not warn players? After all, the notified Xbox One users in February, so why were PS4 users not privy to the same knowledge.
2. Prior to June 4th, it was asked, ""***Are my items and progression cross-platform?""*** to which Epic Games said, ""***Your items and progression will be available cross-platform****.""* Clearly, this *was not the case*. Epic Games should have in good faith qualified their original answer by stating, ""No, contracts limit cross-platform progression, but as of now, PC/Mac users will benefit from cross-platform progression"". Instead, they incorrectly issued a blanket statement stating cross-platform progression is available to PS4 users.
3. The original question from February changed during the June 4th updated, which omitted the important question: ""***Are my items and progression cross-platform?"".*** Evidently, Epic Games has decided to steer away from delivering an explanation. I find this very deceitful to its player base, especially those supporting Fortnite with purchases, yet unable to enjoy the cosmetics they purchased on their Switch.

* None of this is truly groundbreaking, but it illuminates the concerted effort Epic Games' has made to conceal the truth to its players, which I have found to be very off-putting. Man, not even a single warning.",FortNiteBR

I got onto Fortnite today, like many of you, and I saw the week 7 challenges. I got most of them done in a short few hours and I only had 1 left until I completed this week’s challenges. It was the risky reels challenge. I personally don’t like risky reels because it’s small and there’s not a lot of good loot there. 

I tried for about an hour by myself, just dropping risky every time. I couldn’t get the chests at all. After an hour my friend got in and he saw the challenges and I explained that risky was the hardest one by far. He said “fuck it let’s get this challenge done” and we got into a duo lobby. 

My friend and I played for about 2 hours straight and we were dropping risky reels every time, and we never got a singe chest. 

We both decided to get offline and go have some supper. I didn’t get back until about 4 hours later. My friend was still offline so I decided to watch some Netflix. 

Fast forward another 3 hours or so and I’m back on Fortnite. 

My friend still was offline so I decided to go into solo games and get this challenge done. After about thirty minutes I got my first chest. I died about 4 more times after I got that chest. Then I got my second one, and then I got my third one. 

It was awesome for me, feeling like a beast from getting a these chests. I got my last 4 chests in the next two games I played. It was such a good feeling. 

The point of all this semi-high message is that you may just need to take a break and try again later. That’s ok to do. It worked for me and the blockbuster skin is fucking awesome!!",FortNiteBR

I get that the developers have a lot on their hands but honestly all us players on mobile want is a message or epic developers telling us they are working on the issue. I know mobile players are seen as lesser than pc players but still it's the same game, and the developers should be putting equal amount of effort into all platforms and hear out those from those platforms. 

Now mobile has had so many bugs recently and none of them have been fixed, let alone got noticed enough for developers to care. I know it is possible they are unaware of it, but then how come pc bugs are noticed and fixed right away?? All we mobile players want is assurance something will be done. I know this is a rant and some of you will say oh it's a free game or oh they have a lot of work to do. Epic makes so much money off of this game and tbh it's their job to make sure it's an enjoyable experience for players to keep their player base up. 

Now for the real issue. Mobile has had countless bugs, a shooting button disappearing, things spinning out of control in the shop, and now the sound randomly turning off. This greatly affects gameplay and honesty I don't see anything being done to solve it.

This is where you guys come in...people of this subreddit please upvote this so developers are more aware of this issue. I can't see any other way to get this message out and if you think about it nothing will change unless we take action. Even if you play another platform it's the same game and think about how you would feel if that platform was seen as a lesser counterpart from both the community and developers. 

TL;DR: Crapton of bugs on mobile and not a fix or word from developers so upvote for visibility ",FortNiteBR

Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic.

First off I believe every weapon should have a version in each tier, but that's a separate argument.

Examples: 

----------------------------------------
Legendary Bolt Action - 116 DMG

Mythic Bolt Action - 130 DMG / Shoots 2 rounds before reloading / Adjustable Range Scope / Reloads at half speed / Landed shots deal damage over time / Has a set number of rounds that cannot be reloaded / Weapon disintigrates upon firing the
---------------------------------------------------

Legendary Heavy Shotgun: - 77 DMG

Mythic Heavy Shotgun: - 85 DMG / Shoots 2 barrels at once / Reloads at -20% speed / Destroys a single structure in one shot / Shooting target from behind causes disorient
-------------------------------------------------

Legendary SCAR: - 36 DMG

Mythic SCAR: - 50DMG / Red Dot sight with 2x zoom / Double size magazine / No Bloom on first 3 shots
--------------------------------------------------

How to Acquire:

You must already have the weapon's Legendary tier, you can then find ""Mythic Blueprints"" in loot chests and drops, combine the two along with some sort of catalyst, like an Apple, Mushroom,  or Twig, as well as 100 of each material, and you have your Mythic Weapon.
---------------------------------------------------------

Cons: 

Each Mythic Has a set number of rounds that cannot be reloaded.

Weapon disintegrates upon firing the last round.",FortNiteBR

I wanna preface this by saying im not complaining, but simply expressing what is happening. As of 2 weeks ago, materials and llamas were nerfed, bla bla bla. So whats the issue then? The complete lack of metal and brick, and farming it is even more of a pain in the ass. Destroying a stone formation for 30 brick is fine on paper, but in game you realize that stone is spaced out. metal is a different scenario, but brick formations are only giving out 30 brick. So now that people arent farming brick or metal, its only wood. Ive also noticed that people arent carrying copious amounts of wood anymore, which is good and bad. But the issue is when it comes to fighting.

In build battles, they are certainly metas that help you win and help you get the high ground, one of these strategies being double ramp+wall. each of these takes up 40 mats to up 1 elevation. before, this was fine, as everyone had 300 material *easily* if they had 5 kills. and this is where llamas come in. Llamas were good because (A. they had a ton of resources and (B. the loot trickled down. the llamas were the main source of metal and brick, which yes was a bandaid, but a damn good one at that. What now? Llamas give jackshit. 200 mats? each? A llama is supposed to give you a distinct advantage, and now its really just a booster. Which is fine in some eyes.

So what is the proposed fix? I dont know. I think Llamas can keep the equipment nerf, but the material nerf for them wasnt good. Does it give a player an insane advantage? Yes. But those materials trickle down, which is why they were such a pivotal aspect of material farming and building in general. Do they need 1500 each? No. But is 600 noteworthy for something there is only 3 of? No",FortNiteBR

Here's what we know so far about what you'll be doing over the next three weeks: 

**Week 8**

* Deal 250 headshot damage to opponents

* Search 7 chests in Salty Springs
* Search 7 chests in a single match
* Search 7 Hungry Gnomes
* Search between a bear, crater, and a refrigerator shipment
* Get 3 suppressed weapon eliminations
* Eliminate 3 opponents in Pleasant Park

**Week 9**

* Deal 500 damage with explosive weapons to opponents
* Search 7 chests in Moisty Mire
* Use a shopping cart
* Visit 3 different Taco Shops in a single match
* Search between movie titles
* Get 4 shotgun eliminations
* Eliminate 3 opponents in Anarchy Acres

**Week 10**

* Search 7 chests in Junk Junction
* Deal 5,000 damage to opponent structures
* Search a chest, ammo box, and supply drop in a single match
* Skydive through 20 floating rings
* Follow the treasure map found in ...
* Eliminate 10 opponents
* Eliminate 3 opponents in Fatal Fields

All of this is subject to change of course, and there's still the matter of the hidden tiers that will unlock once all of these challenges have been completed. We asked Storm Shield One to dig deeper and perhaps find the location of the treasure map for Week 10, but it seems that data hasn't been added to the game yet. We also have a lot of questions about these purported Hungry Gnomes, and whether they'll be as creepy as the Hidden Gnomes from back in Season 3. Flying through rings sounds like a blast though, so long as Epic drinks deeply from [the teachings of the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiAYP6P_lJo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1814).

The chests by the tree also don’t count, 5 of which I grabbed before noticing, even though the truck behind Risky is farther away it still counts. 

Also stop being so elitist about getting your chests, cool for you dude you happened to do it before everyone else, that doesn’t mean it way “easy” and it doesn’t mean anyone else is worse than you at the game because they have shittier luck.

Allow me to list how terrible the grind for Blockbuster has been for me.

First off, the search Supply Drops challenge. My first SD went uncontested, but once I got it, I was attacked by one guy and then got vultured by a passer-by. Next, I went for another drop in my next game and built around it then shot it down. All of a sudden, A player with the Blockbuster skin builds up and instead of displaying skill, he RPG'S me because what's effort when you have an OHKO? I see him almost teleport around, telling me he ain't from the EU.

Next, we have the goal score challenge. One sentence can be used to describe this:
TAKE YOU BLOODY TENT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND STOP PRAYING ON CHALLENGE DOERS FOR EZ KILLS.

Last, but not to be outdone, we have search chests at Risky. This. Bloody. Challenge. I've yet to get a single open because by the time I get to one, there is always someone breathing down my neck with a shotgun. On top of that, there is no chance to get a gun (or far with it), so I end up emoting and getting sent back to the menu. That's the kind of behaviour on par with elimination challenges.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ve gotten a lot of feedback around the inclusion of the Scoped ARs in the Sniper Shootout LTM. 

&amp;nbsp;

The LTM was designed with long range Sniper combat in mind and the standard Scoped ARs do not stay true to this design. However, we feel that the Thermal Scoped AR still fits the “Seek and Eliminate” style of the LTM and will remain for the time being, albeit with a reduced drop rate.

I'm playing since season 2, and have more than 3000 matches in all queues, sadly I got half only half of this number as kills..


I'm starting feeling frustrated and depressed, every day I try to think where and how to improve my aim, my acknowledge and my skills, everyday I watch some streamers for fun and for learning (mostly SypherPK and DaequanLoco), everyday I play for 2/5 hours (depending on how I feel) and during my matches I try to remember, use and apply the thing I learned (watched and listened) in the streams, but more I play and less I improve.. 


I see my other friends (mostly noobies on fps games) and they become very good at this game, so much good that I feel embarrassed to ask them if I can join into their group.


I can't land a shot that I'm already death! 
At same time i create a 1x1box to defend or a ramp to rush, I already have been countered by a better and faster builder.

Even If I feel bad, I think that I want to get good at the game because I like it and I spent time and money on it..

Clearly you don’t pay attention to anyone else playing the game. The game is literally all about having the newest and best skins asap. Now hear me out. I’ve been playing since October of 2017. Start on Xbox and recently moved over to PC. EVER since October, people have got the feeling of satisfaction and superiority when they have the newest and latest skin. This continues no matter what people will want this Blockbuster skin at all cost and do what ever they can to get it asap. This is also seen at the beginning of every season when those same players buy max tiers. 

Now for my little rant and personal opinion on Risky freaking Reels. Literally the dumbest challenge ever. I love the idea of having to complete multiple weeks of challenges to get rewards but 1) the skin is trash imo 2) I should be able to complete the Risky challenge in at MOST an hour. NOT 2 hours and 15 minutes. Which brings me to a WHOLE other argument. HOW TF ARE PEOPLE, WHO DROP AT THE SAME EXACT TIME AND PLACE AS ME, GETTING A MILE AHEAD OF ME AND SOOO MUCH LOWER THAN ME. Yes, I could have gotten off and gotten it later. But if I’m already on and this is MY free time for the day. I’m going to try to utilize it. You’re probably thinking “oh this is one of the guys that spends all his money on the game”, fortunately for me I do NOT do that. I didn’t even spend money on the game until the first battle pass in the second season and when the Nutcracker skin came out. I have never spent money on tiers and I have only bought about 5 skins in total.

[Text Wall]","As of today there are 25 days left in Season 4, imo one of the best seasons to date, but with that pressing time frame I feel as if Epic isn't thinking about those of us who don't have the time to play.

I, like many Battle Pass holders, buy Battle Passes to make our time in the game feel more worth it. While I'm not complaining that there is a lack of content because we all know you have been more than generous with Battle Pass content but I feel like those who can't play as much are getting a tad shafted with Carbide and Omega.

There is a certain risk involved with purchasing a Battle Pass, which for the most part is literally finding the time to play. Myself, and others, barely make it to Tier 100; which is all apart of the risk but what I find unfair is locking armor pieces behind a Level Cap. 

In Season 3 I made it to Tier 100,unlocked John Wicke and his glider but I barely made it to Lvl 70. I did buy the Battle Pass 3 weeks late mind you but I also had way more time to play. Fast forward to Season 4 (Bought Day 1), where I will make it to Tier 100 but will barely scratch Level 65.  This can be blamed on having to get a second job which puts me at 16 hours a day, with a measly 8 hours to spare for sleep and gaming. It's not your fault that I don't have the time to play like last Season but expecting me to make Level 80 to unlock Omega's last armor piece is kind of a dick move. Not only are you unintentionally punishing thos who own the Battle Pass who struggle to get to Tier 100 but you are also locking us out of a full skin  that will probably never return or have a way to complete in the future.

Sure I'm a little salty, and sure this probably sounds entitled, but with all the updates you do for us to further enjoy the game we all love to play you sure seem to forget that most of your players are average Joes who get the bare minimum for play time.

Anyways that's the end of my rant/pity party.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re always working to improve those cosmetics you throw on before hopping into a match, and one way we have added to our emotes is through facial animations. A few of our current emotes have received a makeover featuring new expressions that were previously blank stares:

&amp;nbsp;


* True Love
* Tidy
* Breaking Point
* Pure Salt
* Kiss Kiss
* Face Palm
* Jubilation
* Finger Guns
* Disco Fever
* Fresh
* Take the L
* Make it Rain
* Hootenanny
* Squat Kick
* Step it Up
* Flippin' Sexy

&amp;nbsp;

Going forward, all new emotes will have facial animations and we plan to more animations to all existing emotes in waves. We’ll continue to polish, and please let us know what you think!

Does anyone remember the Season 3 Wailing Woods chest challenge? It was more difficult than this one and I heard less backlash. The challenge is SUPPOSED to be difficult.

And Risky is not going to be a dead zone afterwards. Risky Reels has a large amount of loot for its size and location, and is used my many squads, including my own.

So, stop raging and deal with it. Isn’t chaos one of the most fun aspects of the game anyways?

2. If you landed on a soccer field and got a gun but the other person didn't, allow them to score before killing them.
3. If you already got your Risky Reels chests, please don't land there, we already have enough people dropping for the 5\-6 chests spawning there.
4. We realize you need to eat some mushrooms and apples for the challenges, but some of your teammates may actually need them to survive, if you know they are low on health, be courteous and allow them to eat some first. 
5. (Light spoilers) If you see people on a hill next to Tilted trying to get their tier, please make sure all of them get it before you start mowing all of them down with your AR from your perfect angle on top of one of the buildings.

If you have more to add, feel free to do so. I realize it's the first day and the week to unlock the blockbuster skin, but we still need to act somewhat civilized and respectful to each other.

How do they know that? Because everyone complains about it. They are pretending it to be a normal mission by rewarding us 5 battle stars after the completion.

Why is it hard? Let me explain you real quick. Your mission (like everyone) is to search 7 chests in a X location. If 7 people land there and everyone opens 1 chest it will take 7 matches to finish the mission. Fair? Yes, it is fair IF IT WAS LIKE THAT. 1 match roughly takes 3 minutes. 3x7 = 21minutes.
But that doesn't goes like that. Approximately 15-20 people land there on the first day. It will take more than 15 games for those people to finish their mission. This means more people will play fortnite.

Why do players want to finish the mission?
Of course the headache. We want to finish it so we can get rid of it by completing the weekly challenges. If you leave that mission to the last, it will give you more headache because only 1 mission has left to get 5 battlestars (or a new skin, idk)

But just when we were leaving most of them started building huge ramps and would fall to death :( They are so clumsy haha

But I helped every one of them. When I see someone knocked I run to them IMMEDIATELY and revive them. Fun thing was that literally EVERYONE was trying to fet far from me. I think they were playing haha

But I did not give up. I always built around them so they can't escape the revive :)

I revived at least 3 persons a game but just after that they would die leaving game :( I think they leave the game by accident haha

Every week the minute the challenges get released this thread get bombarded with complaint posts about how hard it is to find chests at Wailing Woods, or Dusty, or hell even Tilted get bitched about based on the argument that its already popular place to land and it's even worse with the chest challenges.

Have you guys ever tried waiting a couple of hours or even 1 whole freaking day? I know it's a hard concept to grasp, but maybe waiting 24 hours to complete that challenge won't leave you dropping in 15 games to find 7 chests. 

The weekly chest challenge is one of the last challenges I attempt each week. Why? Mainly because I know if I drop into Dusty 6 hours after the release it's going to be mayhem and my odds on getting to a chest is lower. So I use my brain and I complete all of the other challenges that I can, and then maybe 1 to 2 days later I go back and drop into the area of the week and grab my chests in 1-3 games. 

Hell, the other week I went to Retail to collect the chests and in ONE GAME i found 7 chests. I dropped in during a squad match, bus went over Dusty Depot, dropped and landed at the watertower and did my loop around the town to get all 7 chests in one freaking go. 

It's not that hard people. Epic is literally giving you an easy ass challenge to complete, that takes virtually no skill (building / gun play) to master in order to rank up. I'm so sick and tired of each week numerous bitch posts are made saying how hard it is to find chests in Risky Reels when you are literally dropping in 30 mins after the update was released. Uh yeah no shit Sherlock, obviously everyone is gonna drop there so you're chances are greatly reduced. Go do the other challenges first and then by tomorrow you'll drop into Risky and complete the challenge in 1-2 games.

It's no secret that many people are unhappy with the latest material nerfs Epic has implemented.
However, if Epic's vision is to create a game that is balanced between build skill and gun skill, then they are on the right track. 

Before the nerf, players with all build skill and ok gun skill would almost certainly always beat a player who may have really good gun skills, but ok build skill, just due to the fact players could gain so many materials in a very little amount of time and use it in an almost wasteful manner and spam it (BTW even now it only takes me a couple minutes to get to 500+ wood).

I was playing yesterday, and like a lot of people, I like to build as soon as I get into a fight. In earlier patches, I could do this easily as I had plenty of materials to spare always so I could just build away and even use building to avoid certain death. Yesterday though, I found myself continuously low on materials, forcing myself to farm materials more throughout the game and to think twice about placing a structure and how it will be useful to me. Many times in situations where I usually would build, I held off until it really made sense and felt really rewarded placing a strategic structure and getting the kill. 

TL;DR: I believe Epic wants to balance build skill and gun skill. Don't just build, build strategically.

While it seems like the majority of the issue is on Sony, the real problem isn't that we can't cross play, its that we can't use our epic accounts how we want.

We also need to hold Epic accountable for even allowing this in the first place.

Why?

Imagine you're paying for a Netflix account that you access through your Apple TV. One day you decide to buy a Roku box and also hookup your Netflix account through that so you can watch in another room. Now imagine when you tried to do that you received a message that said, ""Sorry your account is permanently locked to the Apple TV, Please create a new account and start you're billing cycle over if you would like to access Netflix on another device""

This is the same thing. None of us would ever stand for that, and Netflix would never allow Apple to even think about doing that. We would all be outraged and calling on Netflix to pressure apple to remove the lock. Same thing applies here, even its the issue is not 100% epic fault, we need to keep pressurizing them so they continue to pressure Sony, they should have never allowed this in the first place.

TLDR: The Epic account issue is not even about cross play, its about being locked out of software by a third party hardware maker. Sony deserves most of the criticism, but we also should be pressuring Epic for even allowing this in the first place.",FortNiteBR

Most streamers buy their way to tier 100 of the battlepass every season and don't bother to do any of the challenges. They just play the game like they always do. Obviously they still want the Blockbuster skin so guys like Ninja and Dakotaz are now spraying posters and going to Risky 50 times to open some chests.

This leads to fun and unusual gameplay but I saw they completed only half of the challenges yet by playing the game normally, most of them being those that require kills (by weapon type or location) 

In my opinion this shows how out of your way you have to go sometimes for challenges.They are not even hard but tedious. Also they heavily influence the gameplay. Right now in 50v50 the team that is not on the Risky Reels side simply quits the game. One minute in and it was 45 vs 16. One minute later it was more or less equal again because everybody at Risky suicided lmao. I don't think that is how gameplay should be influenced

I hope Epic learns from this and implements more longterm challenges instead of daily or weekly challenges. They have been using the same type set of weekly challenges since season 3. Longterm challenges could be something like open 1000 chests, or get 30 shotgun kills over the enitire season. Such challenges can be done by playing the game whenever you want throughout the season.

Now I understand that this may not be something that can be solved in 48 hours and I am also not saying this is Epic's fault. But, what I am asking is a comment or acknowledgment that this is an issue that is either A. being investigated or B. not being investigated. Simple as that.

They're tedious, annoying, and take many MANY games to complete. The hard challenges are the easiest, i completed every hard challenge and the pickaxe one in 2 games of landing at tilted in solo squads and one in shifty. The Risky Reels one by far has taken the longest and has resulted in punching my chair multiple times as well just at the sheer stupidity of this challenge. You seriously made a challenge where there is what, 6 chests? With more than 30 people dropping there at the same time at the beginning, so if less than a quarter of people dropping there get a chest, statistically you could be one in 6 that get it 6/30 times so it could take you about 35 games of straight dropping Risky to get the chests. This neither promotes ACTUALLY playing the game, nor a fun challenge that is difficult to complete. These challenges are garbage, and have been all season. Stop with the tedious challenges, use some brain power and come up with some difficult challenges that require skill, and can be incorporated directly into playing the actual game.

They are trying to get the game ready for esports and a problem that been seen in these early tournaments is that it's campy and fort heavy. So Epic is trying to figure out a way to lessen this.

So way to help lessen the camping is to weaken the power of the forts. So by removing the drop off damage on structures, buffing C4 and buffing the Minigun are all things that Epic has done to make taking out the support of bases easier thus making them less effective. 

Also I believe that Epic is testing and idea that may also lessen this camping and that is by reducing the total number of mats in the loot pool, by reducing the amount of times you find mats on the floor, reducing the mats you get when you do find them and my reducing the mats found in Llamas. -Side note although the Nerf to Llamas makes me sad one Llama did add 1500 mats to the Loot Pool which is good amount- This could possibly help because with less mats and forts being less effective it could provide incentive for players to use their mats to push players and do build battles instead of building forts, which is more entertaining to watch.

Now I understand in the last tournament camping was a big issue. But this is good because it shows that this reduction isn't what it needs to help lower camping. Epic needs to make these weird and risky changes to collect data and see how it changes the game so they can make the game better. So let them
 reduce mats and let then make weird changes so they can collect data and figure out the best way to make the game better.

No dilly-dallying, sugar-coating, bush-hiding, nothin’.

This challenge is not fun. It’s not enjoyable. Every week, I dread the coming of the infamous “Search Chests In” challenge because I simply *despise* doing it.

A challenge is supposed to be something, well, challenging. The only thing this challenge actually manages to challenge is my self-control and will to not rip my hair out and throw my controller across the room. It in no way, shape, or form challenges my ability to play the game or face off against other players. Opening a chest isn’t *hard.*

What *is* hard is having to drop in the same location over and over for hours and compete against other players for a simple chest. I get it. This challenge was designed to get players to discover the map, to get them to drop in a location where they might not usually drop. But let’s face it, this isn’t a small indie game. Everyone and their mother knows about Fortnite.

Veterans and new players alike can agree. Experienced players don’t *need* to drop in one location time and time again. They know the game inside and out. They know what happens when you open a chest. You hold a button and stuff comes out.

Now let’s take into consideration new players. They log in. They spend money on a battle pass. Oh, what’s this? Search chests in the same place? That’ll be easy! Think again, Timmy. You’re about to spend the next twelve hours of your life hating it and the people around you.

Objectively speaking, it’s horrible. The amount of people in one spot causes detrimental frame lag issues and even connection problems. It affects our gameplay and, in turn, our enjoyment. This challenge doesn’t *make us better.* It’s not the same as getting kills with a certain gun that we might not use, which serves as a learning experience towards our gun knowledge. It’s not the same as using traps and learning how to place them in strategic locations where we learn about player traffic and movement. *There is nothing to gain from this challenge.* 

For reference, Week 7’s challenges went live at 1 A.M. PDT. It is currently 5 A.M. and I’m still not done with one challenge. One. It has been four hours. I’ve dropped in Risky Reels around fifty times. In that span of time, I’m still sitting at 4/7 chests searched. A *single* challenge should not take that much time or effort, especially one that isn’t listed as hard (can we talk about how AR kills was listed as hard but pickaxe damage wasn’t?) and that, really, only involves opening a chest.

*This challenge plays itself AND you.*

Epic, please. You’ve listened to the community before and made some great changes. This is another one of those times. Do the right thing.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have another three hours to spend in which I only manage to open one chest each.",FortNiteBR

idk but i feel like epicgames launches only rly bad patches and completely bad nerfs and buffs,.... the last 3 patches were awful and it is getting more and more ""noob friendly"" (for exaple: the jatpack was the worst item in the game  and it was there for like a months,.... with a jatpack every noob was able to  beat a better player and the item was op af, no fall dmg, ez highground etc... )

\- Now the materials are reduced too( u can find only 20 stacks, the lama is useless af 200 from each mats ....) and u have to farm even longer, and that is not the funny part of the game i would say....

\-even streamers dont play as much fortnite anymore and some of the pros nearly quitted already ( for example ninja is not only playing fortnite now, instead he is  playing real royal,... and there are many other streamerss too )

[https://clips.twitch.tv/PunchyCorrectSangSeemsGood](https://clips.twitch.tv/PunchyCorrectSangSeemsGood)\&lt;\-\- clip of dakotaz

\-fortnite needs something new ..... the game is getting boring  and they need to stop adding noob friendly items to the game .... it started with the port a fort, and after that is was always worse ( the new turbo building is bad for the pros too)

the new weapons they added are bad too,... ( the thermal scope AR is not fortnite anymore i woudl say ......) 

\-the battle pass is a nice extra for the game but after a few seasons it will be the same too,.....  we have season 4 rn and not even the battle pass hypes the game anymore,  i mean it has a nice storyline and stuff but thats it,... and the map is getting changed a little bit ....... cool

the challanges are almost  the same every time but a little bit different.... \-

( e.g.: collect Fortnite letters, collect ducks, collect mountain peaks ect....) 

(2. example: kill 3 people there,kill 2 people here, kill 3 enemies in this city...)

(3. e.g.: kill 5 enemies with this weapon, kille another 5 enemies with that  weapon...)

 .... i have about  250 wins in total but i already saw every corner of the map and  it's getting boring. idw to imagine what a player feels like with 1000 s of wins,....

\-The best what epicgames could do  for seasons 5  is a new map,.... it would totaly refresh the game and there would be a new  reason for the hype too.... thats the only thing

if there will be no new map in season 5 and epicgames will carry on and launches bad patches into the game fortnite will die soon,....

Is there a control scheme that works for you? I've seen some pretty weird ones, so lay it on me. Help Rebellium get a Victory Royale!

Why is that? Well, I believe we're getting the 8th loading screen because we're done with the Blockbuster challenges.

Some background info: For the past 7 weeks, completing every challenge on a week (premium battle pass only) got you a loading screen of the plot for Season 4. &lt;!We went from filming a parody of The Shape of Water to your generic superhero movie, and then we got the mysterious Visitor.&lt;! In addition to the free tiers from each one, the loading screen unlocks were tied to the progression of the Blockbuster challenge.

Now, back to the topic. Why did we get the 8th one? It's simple: *because of the fact that the unlockable loading screens were tied to the Blockbuster challenges, and since there were only 7 challenges, there is no need for more screens.* The 8th screen is just foreshadowing for what could happen to next season. This theory may be disproved in the next few weeks, but I think this is a reasonable theory. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Let me get a few things out of the way which might stem off tangents.

* I play for fun
* I have been playing since within a few days of the BR version becoming available on xbox, so September\-ish?
* I don't care about my stats
* When I play with my sweaty team that can effortlessly roll out wins when meme\-ing the game still is fun\-ish.

With recent changes it's just not as fun to play with my casual friends anymore.  In the past if we came into a 4v4 situation 1 good player could make a massive difference because the effective TTK(Time to Kill) was quicker.  This meant that a good player could quickly take advantage of mistakes or situations and turn the odds of the fight. With shotgun damage lowered, it's inconsistencies seeming to have multiplied, the headshot hitbox decreased and headshot multiplier reduced I would say it effectively takes 3 decent pump shots to kill someone, or 1 billion tactical shotgun shots. 

This is has made winning engagements when on a team with basically below average players a lot harder and a lot more frustrating. It's a lot harder for good players to make a difference.  The current meta feels muddy.

 Fortnite is the first shooter game, and I think the first 3d game, my wife has ever played so she is absolutely awful at this game but we would always look forward to playing together on the weekends since we would both have fun in our own ways.  Now it's starting to feel like a chore since I know the game is going to end due to a frustrating engagement instead of a fun one(even if it is a loss).  ",FortNiteBR

The hiders are unable to pick up weapons but are able to farm materials and have there axe as a weapon if they choose to use it and traps, there only objective is to make it until end game without being caught and killed. End game equals something like the 3rd to last circle to allow room for hiding. The seekers land as usual, find guns and try to find and kill the hiders. Every time the storm closes into a new circle the seekers lose 20 or so health. No shield or health spawns in game. If the seekers find and kill all hiders before there health reaches zero they win. If the hiders manage to not get caught and killed by the final circle they win. 

Edit: the specifics could b changed up this is just what I came up with in my head without putting much thought on the details. 

Some distinguishing features between the 2 teams would b nice also. 50v50 mode got a bit confusing when everyone got close together 

Maybe even put a kill timer on the seekers so where if they don’t kill someone every X amount of minutes health goes down even further to balance the end game out better ",FortNiteBR

Here are some points I've heard to make building easier.

1. **Let us map our own buttons**
This is clearly the most preferable, we'll hopefully get this eventually

2. **Swap ramps and floors on the build rotation**
The most simple explanation. Putting walls and ramps next to each other would be an immediate fix to build battles on console.

3. **Get rid of build scrolling in general** 
This is my preference. Pressing B to swap from combat to build is fine, but from there on just make different buttons serve for different platforms. The RB/LB scrolling is tedious and as it stands I need to press 3 buttons to go from building walls to building ramps, which is brutal in build battles against PC players. RT=ramps/LT=Walls/RB=Floors/LB=Roofs is an easy fix. Move ""change material"" to the D-Pad.",FortNiteBR

I hope the devs would realise that a game like this, with tempo like this that a good tickrate is necessity rather than afterthought. The game is much faster than even CSGO and the tickrate is 3 times lower than CS has in official matchmaking. After playing CSGO alone for over 2000 hours, both in 64 tick and mostly in 128 tick servers you can feel the difference and responsivness in the gameplay. Even back in BF3 people complained about the awful tickrate which was 30 tick and in this it's even lower.

Rather than adding guided missiles and making mobile and PC run in same servers fix the core gameplay and add those after it.",FortNiteBR

If the game had predictable spray patterns and low spread, the game would become less of a building game and more of a shooting game. You know how when you are running across a field and somebody starts shooting at you with an AR? Well, lots of the bullets miss because of bloom. If it wasn't there, then if the player had good aim you would be gone before you could do anything. And this applies to all guns. See, in most games where there is very high accuracy the maps are not hugely open and sneaking up on somebody is pretty rare, you normally get head to head engagements. But in fortnite, you can often see a player running across the field and he has no idea you are there. This means if you had a perfect accuracy deagle you could spend 10 seconds lining up the perfect shot and then kill them while they cant do anything about it. Sure, you can say ""sniping is the same way"" but sniping requires significantly more skill as there is bullet time and drop.

 While i do get angry when i miss most of my shots due to bloom, i think i would be angrier every time i got one tapped with nothing i could do about it. I do think the bloom on the deagle should be slightly reduced since it is irrelevant at range, but with perfect accuracy it would be broken. So please, hopefully i have convinced you that bloom is good for fortnite and if not leave a comment.",FortNiteBR

Yes, lots of players drop tilted and that may arguably have changed the flow of the game by having a large number of the player base landing and dying there. But you have to ask yourself why players drop there!

Yes, the loot is good. But its also one of the most interesting places on the map. Sweeping large buildings and holding up with snipers on rooftops is in my opinion battle royal at its best. Its just a well designed section of the map (there is nothing more satisfying than knocking over the clock tower with a couple people inside).

So to all of you saying the map is unbalanced: dont ask to have one of the best areas removed, ask to have new and better areas which compete with tilted put in. A huge problem with the rest of the map is how generic it is.

They can hear footsteps, mining, weapon changes, chest opening, construction and gunfire in the vicinity.

I cannot hear most if any of those at all.

This impacts my game in a number of ways, but most frustrating of all is I can be repeatedly one-shotted from behind with no chance of preparation, barely a second for defence or retaliation.

Players instantly turn in my direction if I so much as switch weapons, meanwhile I cannot hear most people running full tilt at me.

This makes for very frustrating gameplay as I cannot defend adequately unless I am in a specific location with no rear attack possible, such as Shifty Shafts or Loot Lake, or a enclosed room or a coastal cliff. I have to take an excessively stealthy approach to even get to the final 10.

I understand and appreciate what Epic is trying to do in terms of immersive gameplay for hearing people, but I cannot for the life of me defend unless I see someone directly in my Field of View.

Would Epic consider providing some sort of accessibilty option for deaf gamers?

**It would have to be something in a format that hearing players cannot abuse** to get extra infornation, so for example radars are out.

I propose some type of closed captioning or icon that displays with a short delay when a specific soundfile is being played, such as ""FOOTSTEPS!"" or footprints icon. This provides no new information (since they would hear it first) but would at least provide me with *some* warning.

I really am enjoying Season 3 despite the difficulty, and look forward to seeing where Epic take the game.

If you want to argue that you can do this with RPG, you're wrong. The RPG has one single path to the target. This allows you to continuously build around you without worrying about the missile hitting you from another angle.

Very poor play on Epic Games' part by adding this gun as it has literally broken the balance of the game.

I am reiterating the fact that every single game I've played since the update has been won by someone with a guided rocket launcher.

71,ddutra_rs,1522674606,88z65q,36,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88z65q/idea_prevent_or_throttle_construction_when_under/,0,[Idea] Prevent or throttle construction when under fire,"Some background:


- I play on PS4;
- I consider myself average to good on the game - you can check my score here when the tracker is back online (https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Drutra) please do so before posting ""git gut"" - I currently have a 10% win rate;
- I play from day 1.


I am pretty sure the game would change drastically for the better if construction were either blocked when under fire or at least throttled.
It is my opinion that currently construction is used mostly as a ""fuck"" button. When caught in a bad position by a player that put some thinking on his positioning and movement before engaging, some players manage to come out of the mess they put themselves into by spamming walls or stairs. It is some kind of gameplay, yes, but IMO it is not what battle royale should be about.


Battle Royale should be about strategy, planning your routes, flanking, planning before engaging, watching all corners etc. Especially in squad/duo, it is important to be vigilant at all times and it pays off when you see someone before they see you. This all goes down the drain when you go against someone spamming construction, especially someone that is using mouse/keyboard (on ps4). I don't think spamming construction requires too much skill.


I foresee a lot of negativity towards this idea. Before posting please consider I am not complaining. I manage to get my wins just fine and I too spam construction when under fire just like everyone else.
I just think it is not Fortnite at its full potential.
Some may argue that construction is some kind of strategy. I admit sometimes you see a player getting out of a bad situation by using the construction in very smart ways. Most of the times it is just a guy spamming walls and stairs.


To clarify - I think construction plays a major role in this game in movement, vertical gameplay, fort building etc. I just think it should not play a major role in combat.


TL;dr
For a gameplay that rewards strategy either throttle construction when under fire to something like 1 piece every 3 seconds or prevent construction at all when under fire.

What is they found a planet that could have had other life on it? When they went to check it out, maybe they disturbed the aliens on this planet. Maybe that giant blue light is an alien ship coming to invade fortnite, and the next fortnite season is gonna he alien themed. 




I just thought this was a little more likely that the tilted towers meteor, as there were just too many holes in that story, such as the explosions/dinosaurs on the battle pass. They wouldn’t have decided that tilted was gone that long ago (when they made the new battle pass). There was still good feedback in tilted back then.

As you may have heard, the ""random"" controller vibrations have been translated to SOS D5 418. A lot of people are thinking 418 is April 18th, the day the comet will hit Tilted Towers, but I found a bit of evidence that suggests it may happen on another date.

Before I get into this, let me just say that this is a huge stretch and I'm most likely looking too far into it. So this should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. Now with that being said, let's get into it.

Season 3 started on February 22nd and (if the in-game text is to be believed) is scheduled to end on May 1st. That's a total of 69 days.

On the night of April 21/22 (depending where you live) the Lyrids Meteor Shower is supposed to happen. And for those who don't know, the source of this meteor shower is particles of dust from a comet known as ""Thatcher"". April 21st will mark 59 days since the start of Season 3.

If you do the math (59/69) you will get 0.855. Following the rules of math that I learned in school, rounding up to the nearest hundredth will result in 0.86 or 86%. (Basically, April 21st will mark 86% of the way through season 3).

As some people have noted, Toward the end of the Battle Pass Tiers, you unlock the KABOOM emote, but what they didn't realize is you unlock the emote at tier 86.

This piece of potential evidence suggests that the comet may impact on the 21st rather than the 18th. However, as I said at the beginning, this is a huge stretch and should be taken with a grain of salt. Thanks for reading, and lemme know what you all think!

EDIT: I'm aware that Epic publicly stated the controller vibration was a bug, but it could just be their way of trying to cover it up seeing as how the community noticed and decoded it pretty fast. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a possibility that it is indeed a bug, but the way the vibrations work seem too intentional to be a bug IMO.

EDIT 2: As you most likely know, there are a few soccer fields around the map. Recently, the scoreboards started to display 2-1 (21) even at the start of games and WON'T change when a goal is scored. Huge thanks to /u/Evil_Teddy_9 for pointing this out in the comments!",FortNiteBR

Here in the Fortnite community, we look upon and praise the best amongst us for their godly gun skills and uncanny building abilities.  And these players deserve all the attention they receive, as they have reached levels of greatness that many of us can only dream of. But I am here to recognize all of the mediocre players who lurk within this community, dreaming of someday getting a game ending rocket ride no scope or killing 18 straight players without losing a single shield point. We are the players who end most of our games with a solid 1 to 3 kills, occasionally ""popping off"" for 7 or 8 and a top 5 finish. We bask in the glory of every win, as for some of us this may only happen once every one or two weeks, possibly longer. I am calling on all you mediocre players to bask in this mediocrity and embrace it, and join the coalition of mediocre players. We deserve recognition too.

I expect this post to perform similarly to my Fortnite gameplay. Either get completely destroyed within seconds, or receive mediocre success until dying as soon as the pressure is on.

Lastly, if any mediocre players want to officially join my overwhelmingly mediocre coalition, please feel free to DM me.


Edit: Following the mediocre success of my post, I have returned with a second possibly path of mediocrity to pursue.

1: There is the possibility of creating a discord channel for everyone in here to join so that all us mediocre players can squad up amongst ourselves.

2: This idea is somewhat absurd, but i have considered creating a twitch channel that exclusively hosts mediocre players on twitch. therefore, if you are mediocre and want to stream on twitch, this channel would host you so that other mediocre players could watch and revel in your mediocrity. this could be our chance to take the power back from our superior fortnite overlords.

You are nice and not creepy or some really messed up human being. A bit weird is fine as that keeps it interesting if anything

A microphone is not required, although I do have one. It would be nice if you did too, but just listening to any communication I may have (player locations or whatever) is fine too! As long as I'm not hearing continuous background noise or the ever so crisp sound of a shitty mic, we're gucci.

You don't have to be great at the game. Hell, you could even be completely new. I don't mind teaching someone a few things about the game or helping them improve. It's really more so about having fun with others than getting those good W's, but those are nice too.

This is absurd. Pickaxe should be dealing severe damage given it's range, if not instakill. What sounds more devastating? A couple shots from a silenced SMG to your leg or a pickaxe spike going right through your goddamn cranium, crushing whatever was inside and leaving your body lifeless, on the ground as an example of what happens when you try to ninja loot me?

It is probably one of my favorite games of all time. Recently however, I have been more and more frustrated with the gameplay. This frustration is mostly
resulting from the guided missile. Every time I’m in the final couple of groups, there is someone with this weapon who is completely obliterating every other group. I know you can build in front of it, and I know you can shoot it down, but when the persons teammates are shooting at you and you have missiles following you everywhere you go, there’s not much you can do. I’m not trying to be annoying or trying to rant about how it should be taken out of the game, but just trying to see if anyone else in the community agrees with me. I really have an intense hatred for this weapon and I want to see other people’s point of view. What do you think? Is it OP or am I just being crazy!!

When I was doing so, the wording implied (and basically stated) I'd lose all my purchases, progress etc. from the Epic Games account... not my PSN account. Which is where I made all my purchases and made all my progress.

Sucks right?
Good-bye $200 edition of Fortnite's Save The World that isn't even buyable anymore so I can never have it again. I literally just tossed a $200 game away because they can't figure this shit out.

So then I go to link my now freed PSN account to my Epic Games account that is also linked to my twitch and xbox. Guess what? Can't link a PSN account to an account that has an xbox linked to it. That would have been nice to know idk... before going to the trouble of trying to get everything all on one account. Why is it that when I have xbox linked to my account that connecting PlayStation is an option. Why isn't the button grayed out with a ""can only have one console at a time"" message?

I wouldn't have even gone about trying to free my PSN account if I'd know it would be absolutely pointless.

So hooray for me. 

What are the chances Epic Games will give me back my $200 edition of the game in any capacity?

I'm so livid right now.

I got 99 rockets after 5-7 kills so I built a huge metal base in the circle's center, which was the highest ground, opened a window in the back where I was almost sure no one was, checked all the side of the mountain for any sneaky invasions, and if there wasn't one, used it for recon and killing. It's actually even worse in Solo because you can't rush up to me, having your mates protecting you. If you **try** to destroy the rocket, you give away your position to everyone as well so you gotta hope no one wants your cute ass.

If you build, I fire at you until you have to run from the storm. Then I wait in the air, until you get out to run. That's if i'm the only one firing at you. If I destroy your base and someone else kill you I still win without exposing myself.

The only winning move is to have everyone gang up on the guy with the rocket launcher. When I hear the rocket launcher going on someone, I rush to try to kill him quickly, because I know i'll be the next target. 

I don't know how it should be nerfed, maybe reduce the time you can control it ? The number of rockets one can have ? Because while previously it was already cancerous to receive, and lose to, a 5 minutes rocket barrage, now that's straight up... I don't even know. I'm speechless.

It’s a cool idea but it promotes camping in a fort and just spamming the missiles over and over again. It also hurts aggressive players like me who like to rush out in the open, because every time I hear that missile go off I need to stop what I am doing and worry about the missile - either shooting it or boxing myself in. It benefits campers who sit in bushes and huts who don’t need to worry about being targeted by the missile. One possible solution is a cool down time, so you can’t spam the missile over and over again, giving the opponent an opportunity to rush the player using the rocket forcing him to defend himself. 

I’m curious to see your guys’ thoughts.

I and MANY OTHERS (this is facts) Would love an open terrain and ""bot practice"" with unlimited ammo and resources. 

This would do several things.

* Spend WAY MORE time Actually shooting and perfecting your aim. 

* Practice shooting and aiming with EVERY single gun the game has to offer to get familiar with recoil patterns, reload times etc. Grenade angles, explosion spread damage. 

* Understanding building damage and improving technique to knock em down.

* practice Creating structures that become second nature when done in game. 

* Learn to react to enemies that move.

* Practice building ALLL KINDS of buildings and speed build practice and hot key learning. 

* practice in a place uninterrupted until you feel you're much much more mechanically fit.

* Spend less time frustrated by the game because you aren't ""learning fast enough"" 

* Spend time playing the game increases likelihood of purchasing battle pass thus making them money

* Spend time in game increases likelihood of purchasing any extras game has to offer


* Increases playee retention because people won't get so pissed off that they keep dying etc and never win games because they simply never get to apply the skills necessary to win at a fast enough pace. People get bored quickly when they don't succeed and and flustered and I know A lot of people including myself who quit the game because I just sucked so bad and could never do anything. Now I'm back at it and better but I feel i am not practicing essential skills as much as I want. 

* Waste WAY LESS time because you don't have to worry about the following:
Open lobby➡️hit ready ➡️wait➡️ practice for possibly 30 seconds in pre game lobby➡️ wait for battle bus ➡️ drop from bus ➡️ land➡️ die because you had a potion and guy had shotgun....➡️ repeat.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88i57r/controller_vibration_translated_to_morse_audio/

Anyways, what if the vibrations aren't in Morse code?  What if the poster was just BSing us?  Epic confirmed via Twitter that the vibrations are just a bug.  You can see that in the comments here 

https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/979745167656833029?s=20

So everyone's been talking about how tilted is going to get nuked or hit with a meteor?  I believe that number, but that vibrations may just be a bug.  

Has anyone else taken the time to get all the vibrations, transpose them into Morse code, and then report your findings?  If you haven't, then don't be so quick to believe it.  Everyone took their word for it, and didn't question a thing.  

The poster could just be shit posting and it turned into a big thing, or BSing for karma.  Never believe what you read in the internet.  

But maybe epic is playing us in the tweet, telling us the vibrations are an issue in their end when really they ARE in Morse code.  

I don't know, and neither will you unless you take the time to get all the vibrations and transpose them into Morse code.  Don't believe everything you read.  I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying it could be complete BS. As could Epics tweet.  Only time will tell.

I can't ever win by myself. I've watched guides and everything online, I watch Ninja and Myth and try to copy what they do, and I'm at the point where I can get 3-4 kills in the beginning after landing, but when it comes to winning the game I simply can't do it. 

What's the point of playing the game if you can never accomplish the most rewarding part? Maybe its just me, but I get frustrated loosing over and over, and I feel like there is no escape. I like winning in squads but I feel like I just get carried there.

Am I just being an idiot? Should I really just put more time in and maybe I'll see improvements?

(it will  also be very long)

Back in September, after seeing some gameplay of other famous games, I literally googled Battle Royale PS4 (the only gaming gear I have, my PC was trash) because I really liked the genre and was looking for something similar.
I read an article that in 10 days a iteration of a already existing game was doing a free battle royale mode, I was very happy and waited to download it as soon as it was released on the store.
 I played it incessantly for days and my first win came after 20 - 30 games, the time needed to understand the weapons, the mechanics and the map.
I was ""wow you can also build stairs to reach the treasures up here"" and find it was really smart mechanic.
I played it everyday always having fun, even not winning for days, until the last couple of weeks, where I'm only playing for daily quests to complete the battle pass I bought.

Now I'm not enjoying the game anymore, it has become too frantic, fast paced.
Back then you could sit on your chair and have fun, now it has become a fragfest, people jumping and shooting everywhere, can't shoot at anyone that they have already built a 10 meters high structure and shooting you from above, every fight resolves in a shotgun duel where the winner is the one that can place a 250hp headshot for first, or can switch faster to another shotgun after the first shot, homing missiles the spot you trough the map, medium-long range weapons useless as anyone can build ramps and rush to you in complete security.

This is becoming a 3d person-big map call of duty, and I'm loosing interest in it day after day also seeing what the devs are introducing patch after patch (unnecessary shotgun, POIs that made the map  only close quarters, guided missiles etc...)


Edit: fell free to look at my stats, if you don't believe I really liked the game, and played it a lot https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/DLVittorio 

Tldr: I'm losing interest in the game with the current building and shotgun meta.

The following is what he told me and found with links. As a disclaimer, I know there a ton of posts on a lot of these topics so I tried my best to put it all together and give everyone credit by providing the sources. Here are the links for the posts that sparked my friend's curiosity.

The founder of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, started his career by making an old video game called ZZT released in 1991. In the game there is an odd scene where a city gets hit by a meteor. It had no context in the game but this was before the internet exploded so there were no forums for people to try and figure it out. 





Screenshot of ZZT: https://twitter.com/liptytip1/status/980393509458010112





Tim Sweeney merged together with a Polish company after he had formed Epic Games nearly tripling the company's net worth. Later on the Polish company and Sweeney parted ways. Many people believe this is why the map was based around Poland.

The towns line up perfectly with Polish cities as well. For example, Warsaw is well known as the biggest shopping center in Middle Europe. If you transpose the Fortnite map over the map of Poland, Retail Row lines up perfectly with Warsaw. In northern Poland there is a ghost town. The inhabitants left during WWII and the area is turned into a graveyard for the many people who died during the war. Take a guess where this area lines up with almost perfectly when you transpose the maps… Haunted Hills.





Here's where it gets crazier. The head of the Polish sector of the company Epic Games was partnered with was from a town in Poland called Poznań. A town which had an asteroid hit its most densely populated city and which in the game's case is Tilted Towers. It is called The Morasko Meteorite Reserve. However, my friend believes that there's a possibility it will hit the borders of Tilted like the one in Poznań if not entirely wipe out Tilted to change up the game and it's meta.

Although many people expect this catastrophic event to occur on April 1st, it is equally likely that Epic Games aligned their in game meteor shower with the Lyrids Meteor shower which occurs every year between April 16th-25th. This would mean that the Morse code is referring to Tilted Towers getting destroyed on April 18th (418).

The problem is not the weapons themselves but the amount of rocket you can get!

Yesterday I won a solo match where at the end of the match when it was me vs the last guy I had 109 rockets! This is not acceptable at all. I mean I am a fairly decent player and I'm good at building so with a legendary rocket launcher and 109 rockets there is no way that guy could've won! It's just stupid cause I'll have more rockets than he can build to protect himself.

This is even worse in duos or squads where you just get infinite spam of rockets and grenades and even if you end up winning the fight you'll be without materials. This has become particularly bad with the introduction of the Lamas that grant too many rockets!

The bottom line is that rocket drop rates have to be nerfed. The drop should be 1 instead of 2 and the Lamas should give less than 10 rockets!",FortNiteBR

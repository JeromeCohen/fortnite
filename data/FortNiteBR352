Maybe they get a rush from being 12 stories up in the air, maybe they enjoy the view. As it stands, every lobby will have players that will prevent this from happening. Is it ethically justified for players to prevent this dream? 

Those in support of spawn-destruction(animals) could say, well the very purpose of this game is to kill each-other, destroying our structures on spawn island is no different. However, these killing are done with a purpose. To get your loot and to lower the number of competitors in your chase of the sweet victory royale.

But destruction on spawn island is of no purpose. It is simply to attack the happiness of those in the community that dream to one day have dance battles soaring in the sky.

Or at least have some sort of sale or sales.,"To start off I just wanna say that i'm not that old (14) and want to express some of my feelings towards the price of the skins and such, Obvs I don't have a job and that might just make you downvote this post since, yes, you're right, I am 14 and don't have a job and maybe in your opinion I shouldn't be buying skins at my age but I would disagree. Coming from someone who has been playing games like WoW since they were about 4, I am a huge fan of cosmetics. Since WoW has a lot of customization, with the ability to transmog items so that they have the appearance of a really cool item but you aren't actually wearing the item. I love looking cool and badass or just silly in some cases. In wow that was easy to achieve, just had to farm for it and pray to RNG. Now i'm not saying they should take away purchases and make everything obtainable through farming because that would just be silly with the fact that the game is free to play, i'm just proposing that maybe they lower the price of some of the skins. Specifically legendary skins. I am a big fan of space and love the way the Dark Voyager skin looks. And when I looked at the awesome dark vanguard and ships that it has, I got really excited. But then I saw the hefty price tag. 2000 V-Bucks. And the ships are 1200 a piece. 32$ if I want a cool looking skin and an awesome glider :( That's not easy at all to get at my age. A lot of kids my age just can't go out and ""Mow peoples lawns,"" or ""Shovel some driveways,"" (Ik its coming to summer but just an example.) Sadly now a days kids are not trusted to do such things well, just can't get the courage to ask or live in an area where a lot of those things are taken care of (Apartment Complexes) and it just sucks that I can rarely get these skins. They don't last in the store long (I think like 2 days for featured items) and it gives an incentive and feeling of urgency to buy it, and yes I do understand that is a business tactic, but when I see that it just saddens me. Because if I am going to do some work for someone on saturday and the cool skin goes into the shop on like Tuesday, i'm just SOL. Idk, it just seems like a bit ridiculous for someone my age to be able to buy a skin that costs that much. I mean after all the look of this game really attracts younger audiences. 

 The other thing is sales. I don't think I can't recall a sale of any sort in all the time i've been playing this game (Two months now I believe) on V-Bucks or skins at all. I think that they would get even more business for this. I mean just look at steam and it's several big sales. Those are huge, even to the point where they are made into memes. I'm not saying we should go summer sale big with sales in this game, but it would be nice to have like a 25% off V-Bucks sometime.

One more thing to add about sales. In Warframe for example, you log in everyday and get a daily reward. Sometimes that reward is 25-75% of a purchase off their premium currency. Again, i'm not saying they should do that, I think maybe if you got enough wins, or in the battle pass they had sales of different rankings. 25, 50, 75% off. Hell even 10% would be nice. And you could say that yeah, you can a good amount of V-Bucks during the battle pass, but the amount you get pretty much equals another battle pass. So you don't wanna just waste those V-Bucks otherwise you won't be able to have a battle pass next season.

To close this out, I just think it would be nice if something like this was added. Maybe these are silly ideas, I mean I am 14 and uneducated in a lot of areas when it comes to business, but I would love to hear what you guys think

P.S. I do understand that cosmetics are COMPLETELY cosmetic as the name implies, but you can't just be like ""You don't need those skins, you can be default or whatever the battle pass offers."" Very true, but that gets really boring and a lot more effort is put into shop skins as a lot of people have noticed. ",FortNiteBR
12,CertainlyJB,1524780706,8f6n7w,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8f6n7w/epic_seems_to_be_throwing_every_idea_at_the_game/,4,"Epic seems to be throwing every idea at the game and seeing what fits, why not try a suppressed AR and suppressed Sniper.","I was thinking suppressed AR would just be purple and gold variants of the scar, 3-4 damage reductions and slight reduction in accuracy. Sound would be louder than suppressed pistol and mp5, but still noticeably quieter and harder to pinpoint than regular scar’s. Damage drop off would be a tad less than the regular scar as well.

Suppressed Bolt Action Sniper would still be fairly loud but become more difficult to pinpoint outside of 125 m. I thought that in this case, the gold bolt itself should become suppressed, since there is virtually no difference between blue, purple, and gold bolts aside from slight damage differences that rarely make a difference. The blue bolt would now do 105 base damage, purple would do 110, and gold suppressed would only do 100.

What are your thoughts on these items? Would you balance them differently, or not add them at all? Please no toxicity, I’m just throwing ideas around, not saying this is a necessity :)

Essentially, very low skilled players keep getting matched up with absurdly high skilled players and while somewhat entertaining, is ultimately ruining the competitive side of Fortnite BR.  Watching Hamlinz chase around an 8 year old for his last kill (https://youtu.be/3orsabAT-AY?t=9m42s) is something that is hilarious but also kind of humiliating for that kid to deal with.

And that's why I'm here, to propose a Matching Making system that will better pair up players, otherwise you just have the little kids playing on the adults basketball court (aka the adults will leave to play PUBG).  Would just like to say ahead of time that I understand that you can't put all bad players on a map or else it will take forever for a game to conclude, but there is still a good opportunity to seize and test before season 4 really gets into swing.


The system is weighted in 7 different categories, each with a percentage that all total up to 100%.  With that number, you can then place people in different leagues;



25% or under: Bronze

25% to 50%: Silver

50% to 75%: Gold

75% and up: BR League, which has it own ranking system and even more specific criteria to determine placement


And here are the 7 Different areas to weigh:

***Wins*** **30%**

Why we play, no status is more important and ultimately various combinations of said skills below will lead to multiple paths of victory.



***KDM*** ***(Kill Death Ratio per Minute)*** **25%**

Kills per minute is a better measurement than overall K.D as skilled players that drop at crowded locations like Tilted Towers or Retail Row ultimately end up with more resources and weapons than their opponents, greatly increasing their chances of winning.



***APM*** ***(Actions per minute)*** ***for JUST build mode*** **20%**

The one thing that beats accuracy.  The ability to build and adapt to your opponents placement is key to victory in pro player face-offs.  Just tracking build APM gives a more accurate assessment of skill than measuring all actions available as numbers can be easily padded in between battles.



***Weapons Accuracy*** **15%**

Once you eventually run into opponents, connecting with shots is what will win the engagement.  Higher accuracy correlates to faster kills.



***Time alive aka survivabilty*** **5%**

Ability to stay alive and assess situations
is more important than resource collecting due to ability to adapt on the fly; resources are stationary, opponents constantly move and you must choose the right times to engage.



***Resources collected*** **3%**

Part of survivability, knowledge of ideal resources to farm and also tied to looting downed opponents
No chance involved other than amount received



***CPG chests per game*** **2%**

Chance is a major key, so very low % given, shows map knowledge and increases chance of receiving better weapons



Thanks for sticking with it this long.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask below as I'm sure I left some gaps in there.  Best of luck in getting wins today and let me know if you think I should do a post covering the 5 S's to Success in Fortnite, peace!

Lately, all I seem to hear about is Fortnite. Most of the complaints seem to be about addiction rather than grooming, and from what I can gather there’s nothing particularly unusual that should make this game more ‘risky’ than other online games. 



I always try and be fair and balanced and hate when others in my field over sensationalise or jump on the bandwagon about hot topics. So to those that play the game, is there something about it that makes it more addictive than other games? I don’t remember this much hype in schools even over GTA/Halo/COD that were absolutely huge when released. I had a referral today where the kid (about 12yo) apparently couldn’t concentrate throughout the day at school and told his teachers all he could think about was Fortnite. Generally I find these kinds of complaints are more about shitty parenting than anything else, but it just grabbed my interest that there were so many complaints at once. I’d normally play the game myself to see what all the fuss is about but my PC is out of action at the moment :(

So me and many other players I know were banned from epic games (AS-18006) after a week from receiving an email about a refund (that we didn't request) and the money wasn't actually returned to me, I did hear rumors about a database security breach a week ago, here's how I see it:

1- attackers hacked the db

2- attackers used many accounts to request refunds to their own paypal (or in other words, steal money from epic)

3- a week later epic bans all the victims' accounts for fraud

This only happened to players who spent money on the game, and we can't simply get new accounts, I had  the complete battle pass.

From my angle, this isn't really my fault, and I didn't fraud epic games.

What if it gets reworked so it works like the opposite as it does right now? The use would be instant, it would give you 25/25 and you could go over 200hp with it, BUT it would wear off slowly in exactly 25 seconds. Also, you wouldn't be able to use another one until the effect of the first one ends completely.

This would make the Slurp not only viable, but exciting to use.

It's a small little teaser, but it's starting to seem like the innocent comet crashing into Tilted Towers to wipe it out might be hinting at something bigger. There have been numerous posts regarding the signs in Tilted Towers, as well as the recent Emergency Broadcast System which has been put to use on TVs around Fortnite's Battle Royale island. This evidence hints at the presence/arrival of aliens, since there have been strange shapes in the sky \(resembling UFOs\) as well as UFO\-shaped objects in Tilted Tower's signs. With the post Epic Games made just this morning, it seems like there may be superheroes involved. The comet in the sky seems like it could be representative of the comet in the movie, seen in the trailer \(off the reflection of Doctor Strange's large window thing\).

What do you guys think? Might Season 4 be nicely timed with the released of Avengers: Infinity War, could it be paying homage to the movie, or is it just a coincidence? I'm honestly kind of hyped for whatever new limited game modes this season may bring.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;  
**First Shot Accuracy**
&amp;nbsp;  
In v3.6 we added an accuracy reset when crouching/uncrouching. This was added to prevent undesired gameplay where players would quickly uncrouch, fire a perfectly accurate shot, then crouch again for cover. As an unintended side effect, a short delay was introduced when going from hip-fire to aiming. 

We’ll be pushing a hotfix shortly to revert this v3.6 accuracy reset. We will separately address the crouch/uncrouch in a future update.

**Week 10 Challenge - Skydive Through Floating Rings**

We found an issue with the Weekly Challenge “Skydive through floating rings”, where rings were intermittently granting credit.

They also updated their website (https://www.fortnite.com , https://epicgames.com/fortnite) with new promotion material.


Here is a gallery of some things I found, with explanations below https://imgur.com/a/1ISIpMN

So first of all the phrase ""BRACE FOR IMPACT"" shows up everywhere. This includes the title of the webpage, the URL (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/battle-pass/brace-for-impact) and even the source code.

Further digging into the source code reveals element class names and image urls (shown in gallery) being referenced as ""comet"".

This is clear evidence that the comet is related to the season 4 and most likely the comet will hit on the 30th of April.

Finally, there is a hidden youtube embed hidden in the source code which I can't seem to be able to view. If anyone else is tech savvy, try getting the video to play, maybe we can find the url of a potentially unlisted video!

I've been targeted by people on my own random squads just for having the only default skin... sometimes they legit just kick me from parties and say mean shit, sometimes they kill me when im really high up, sometimes they just don't revive me.

So what I don't want to pay money for a free game? People are pressuring me into getting a skin just because they don't want to play with a default... like that's not going to change my performance...

Repeated incidents of taking headshots from miles away while running and jumping in random patterns is ridiculous, and while technically possible, there aren't THAT many real human players capable of that.
Next,
Surprising someone running past you from just a few meters away, start shooting at them with an AR, before you know it and before your pathetic AR body-shots have time to finish him, he has time to locate you, turn to you and accurately fire headshots at you.
Same scenario but from close proximity.. take headshots from shotgun.

And so on.

Now I can accept there are a few people out there who are legit capable of such performance, but they are the top fraction of a percent, and not someone you run into every other game.

Being able to see the person who killed you play after you died usually only strengthens my suspicion in foul play. 

Like I said, I do take into consideration that there are many players out there who are better than me, but the machine level like performance is not something most humans are capable of, the reaction time in many cases are way faster than the average reaction time of a normal human being, and that's also assuming their aim is 100%.

Hackers/cheaters infestation is some that ruins the game and has to be dealt with.  I want to play Vs. other humans and not bots.

EPIC seem to have made a complete u-turn to what they did with Paragon. Now they are focusing too much on adding new ""content"" and unwanted items into the game instead of trying to fix the bugs and issues that so many people experience everyday.

The last patch, if you can even call it that (didn't patch much), was a disappointment. So many issues that have been there for months and are still not fixed. Furthermore, it seems to have added in even more glitches and bugs than it previously had.

It almost feels like EPIC knows this but are trying to capitalize on its success and rake in as much money as possible before the game tanks and its forgotten or taken over by the next big thing and that fixing those issues wont matter in the long run as the game will die out. But you know what will matter? All those v-bucks they sold us. 

to be fair, i was on that hype train as well. Bought v-bucks and skins and whatever with money that i earned but slowly stopped doing this as the more i played the game, the more i realized that skins and emotes are the only things interesting in this game. Now i only play with friends because its the only way i can enjoy myself now in this game.

So please...Can we not let this turn into another Paragon.

Rest in Piece Paragon.

Deaths based off chance are extremely frustrating, and the more the game moves in that direction the more it will push away its veteran players.
It would be nice to hear from Epic what their philosophy is on weapon balance, it seems that they want to cater more towards the casual player.  
  
I understand that the game relies more on  strategy and building than pure accuracy, but I felt that the first patch of the first shot accuracy was in a good place.  

Mechanics like impulse nades, switching quickly between various weapons, and speedy building/editing are fun and interesting to watch, and I think Epic should add more similar mechanics, rather than start removing them.

I understand Epic is a business and needs to make money, so what if they charge us the normal amount of v bucks that a skin / glider costs and in return you unlock a very difficult challenge, 20 kills in one game, win a solo squads etc.  Upon completion of the challenge you unlock its specific   skin / glider / cosmetic. Obviously it is the players own risk if they buy the challenge and are unable to complete it. 

Using this system Epic would still make the same amount of money as if they released the skin normally and people would be proud to own the skin and would be show it off as it shows they completed a tough challenge. ",FortNiteBR

The comet has been brought to earth by aliens, who wants to invade the Earth. They will use that comet to engulf the entire world with the purple storm. On the gameplay, we could see lightning strikes which spawn the aliens. That makes it possible that the storm is used as a transport device. Game descriptions says that 98% of population has vanishes, they are brought in to the aliens and transformed them into zombies.

Now the zombies are used as minions. The aliens are the generals and the zombies are the soldiers. They are the ones who will get rid of the people taking up arms against them. Thus bringing us the gameplay of Fortnite PvE.

The aliens wants to control the human population because they want to either colonize, extract its resources, or both.

This entire comet thing is just Epic Games building hype for the PvE, also to raise even more attention to the Fortnite BR. Basically killing two birds with one stone.

The comet becoming bigger is just a sign that the PvE is nearing its release. Also means thst they are stepping up the hype neaeing release.

What I do not like about it is that it was way to easy to get to tier 100. They keep giving us free battle stars cuz the servers were down, instead they could just give us 100 v bucks or nothing, I mean it's a free game.

I never bought tiers and i got to tier 100 like 2 weeks ago by pretty much only playing solos. 
In season 2, getting the black knight was difficult. And I like that. If u got that without buying tiers, you'd feel a level of accomplishment. 
When you reach tier 100 now, it's like ok. That was easy. 

And I also think tiers shouldn't be buyable.
That way, if you see someone with a max skin, you can be sure they're at least decent. I know this won't happen though cuz it's how epic makes money, but idk. I think they should make it so u get skins from leveling up and not going up in tiers. (They can do both but I meant since levels aren't buyable, it would be cool) this is just my opinion though.

I am beyond blown the fuck away how a company that has made hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars in the past 6 months can't seem to fix one of the above mentioned things, or even give us a timeline on when they will be fixed.

This is why every BR game goes to shit, time and time again. They all cater to casuals. All efforts are put into micro-transaction updates, and the same thing is said every single time, ""it's early access"".

I'm a 12+ k/d player, with a 34% WR, and an avid FPS gamer, never before in my life have I been frustrated by so many fucking mechanics in a single 30 minute game.

Edit: I'm sure my post will get flamed and downvoted, even though every single thing I said is true. But port-a-forts and clinger bombs are more important than upvoting issues that matter. So are memes and skin concepts, rather than making this game better. 

Edit 2: It's funny to read comments on my post of you all defending a developer that has not fixed 1 of the above mentioned problems. Where is the transparency? Are they going to say when it's being fixed? That they are working on it? Server upgrades? Etc...? No, because they won't spend $$ to make $$.

Not only have I played them since I was a toddler but I have always been pretty good at games. Though nothing special, I have even made money at a few points in my life from playing games by placing well in tournaments. I am pretty decent at video games.

So the other day my son pops the dreaded question that lots of 9 year-olds are popping their parents right now... 'Dad, can I play Fortnite?' 'Ugh... a game where you shoot other people? I'll get back to you on that.' researches game in depth, talks to mom Fortnite barely makes the pass. The next day: 'Yes son, you can download Fortnite!' 'Woo hoo! We can even play duos together Dad! We're gonna win lots of games like Ninja because you're so good at games Dad.' 'cough #$@! cough ... Oh no... uhh.... on second thought.'

So I go all out (I play on pc) - I watch streams, watch how to videos, anything to get a leg up and impress my son. And then play about 30 games to get my feet wet. And wow... I SUCK.

This is what my dad must have felt when I was playing Mega Man or Ninja Gaiden at his age. In over 30 games I managed a whopping 3 kills. Two were cheap kills with a rocket launcher. I can't believe how bad I am at this game. My son sighs when he plays with me now. I'm supposed to impress him by not sucking at games! I'm supposed to be super Dad who can teach him tricks in Minecraft years later.

So is there any help anyone can give to this sad dad? I have never in my life been actively bad at a video game. In more recent times I was a platinum player at LoL, gold at Overwatch - I have never struggled with the hip new multiplayer game. But for the life of me I can not help but get rocked by little kids playing on their phone.

Outside of 'git gud', does anyone have a few solid pointers to give me to point me in the right direction? This isn't just about my son anymore - this is almost a darn mid-life crisis situation.

If a single dance costs 2-5-8 dollars they could atleast make us buy those, doing whole battlepass tiers still doesn’t grant you enough for a legendary soin which sucks, with not everyone wanting to waste alot of money on cosmetics, these challenges would be great.

Nobody complains about damage numbers for those weapons. We complain about RNG/bloom, but that's a different discussion.

Shotguns on the other hand have 10 pellets per shell, each pellet will hit for 1/10 of the total damage for that weapon, as seen in the inventory. For example, the blue pump will deal 9.5 damage for every pellet impacting the body. If every pellet hits the head, it's 9.5x10x2.5 (crit) = 237 damage. 

Thats a LOT of variables that AR's don't have. 

A pellet can either hit for crit damage, hit for standard damage, or miss entirely. Multiply that by 10 pellets that could do any 1 of those 3 things, and you have a LOT of potential damage numbers popping up on your screen.

The spread pattern is mildly random. Any game worth its salt has slightly changing spread patterns. It would be ridiculous if each projectile left the barrel at the exact same position and velocity in relation to the other pellets, every time. 

There is also an effective range of this spread. It doesn't matter if the enemies head is PERFECTLY sitting in the dead center of your crosshair if you're 100 meters away. I think we all know this. However my point is that there is a certain range where it becomes impossible to hit a 1 pump. The pellets have had too much time to travel and have now diverged a long way from one another.

That big fat shotgun crosshair is also probably subconciously making you think the game is trash. Guess what? The pellets do NOT automatically fill 100% of that square box. Did the enemies entire head perfectly fill the crosshair? What about if the head and shoulders filled the crosshair? What if the head filled 50% of the crosshair? These will result in WILDLY different damage numbers - as they should.

In other games - we don't give a shit because we can't see damage numbers, and we get over it and respawn within 10 seconds. 

Visual trails of each pellet are generally a good indication of hit registration, but not always. That bright orange/yellow burst of pellets is an in-game visual effect. It is not connected to what's ACTUALLY happening between you, the server, and your target.

Don't bother using the replay system to analyze hit reg, you need to watch your actual gameplay. 

There will always be LEGITIMATE bugs and glitches. This thread is not about that. Don't post videos like the female Twitch streamer pumping that stationary dancing guy in the head at point blank range for piss poor damage. Instances like that occur VERY rarely. 

We also have zero clue about your own latency and potential packet loss in a game.

However for 99% of the probably tens of millions shotguns shells fired daily, things are working as intended.

* Actually review your footage if you're so keen on whinging to Epic about this. FRAME. BY. FRAME. Not at half speed. You cannot effectively judge these mechanics watching a video with 30 or more still images per second, when only one of those frames actually matters.

* Pause at the VERY last frame prior to the firing of the weapon. LOOK at where the enemies body is. Is it only slightly within the crosshair? I'm gonna bet you it is.

* Watch the following handful of frames. Watch the pellets fly past your enemies face, or into a wall. 

* Stop pretending the game is trash when you and your enemy are bouncing around like complete idiots 2 meters away from each other, mashing the fire button on a green tact, with your sensitivity that is probably too high, while not ADS'ing. If your aim was so incredible, you wouldn't have a 1.0 K:D ratio and a 3% win rate, you're not Ninja.

* Don't expect high damage numbers unless your enemies head and neck fill up the vast majority of your crosshair. Yes - not just IN the crosshair, but filling most of it. If there is a lot of empty space in your crosshair square, some pellets WILL hit that empty space.

It doesn't matter if the enemies head was in the dead center of your screen - some or perhaps a LOT of those 10 pellets will not hit.

People are often posting clips of their horrible shotgun damage. All the upvotes go to the guy saying 'omg that's horrible'. 

Inevitably, someone will actually freeze frame their shots and post them in the thread, making it very clear that the aim was the problem. These posts always get buried under the meme train because we all feel better thinking the game is broken, rather than our aim.

Feel free to post legitimate, reasonable quality in game footage into this thread if you want to. Not one off clips from some streamer. One fired shell out of tens of millions per day does not equal a game breaking mechanic. 

""I swear to god I hit a guy once square in the face and did 11 damage then he one pumped me"" is bullshit anecdotal saltiness that doesn't help anyone. Did you watch it frame by frame? Can you post it here? If not then your story means nothing and Epic aren't going to do shit about it.

The below thread/freeze frames is what happens on every single video that gets posted. Just one recent example out of dozens.

Sure, a sniper rifle is better than the Scoped AR, but how many times have you ran into a scoped AR without a sniper rifle? I have plenty of times, so take it. Trade it out when you find a sniper rifle. And if you already have a sniper rifle, don't take it! Okay, fine, some people understand the difference and just don't take it because it's a lousy weapon as a replacement for a real AR. And those are the people who don't listen to what they say. Scoped Assault Rifle, it's Scoped for a reason, because it wasn't meant for medium range like a Burst AR, a Regular AR, or a SCAR, it was meant for a long range shot. It wasn't meant to replace an AR, because if you use a Scoped AR instead of a regular AR, you are not going to win medium range fights. To sum up that paragraph, here's a table showing the 4 guns' powers.

|Gun|Shooting Speed|Bullets it can hold|Range of a Fight|Reload Time|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Scoped AR|Medium Shooting Speed|20 Bullets|Long Range Fights|Medium Reload Time|
|Regular AR|Highest Shooting Speed \(On the graph\)|30 Bullets|Medium Range Fights|Medium Reload Time|
|Bolt\-Action Sniper Rifle|Very Slow Shooting Speed|1|Long\-Range|Very Slow Reload Time|
|Semi\-Auto Sniper Rifle|Slow Shooting Speed|10|Long\-Range|Slow Reload Time|

So, Epic Games, Here are 2 ways that you can fix the Scoped Assault Rifle and probably fix the hate and make the Scoped AR better. 

Make the ammo it can hold in a magazine bigger.

Maybe make it at 30 instead of 20, people sometimes don't take the Scoped AR because of that reason and other reasons that may seem to annoy them \(Which some of those problems are on this list\). So just make it so that the gun can hold 30 bullets instead of 20, then having to reload again. Maybe more people will pick up the gun if it holds 30 bullets. Maybe, if you feel like it, you can make it hold 40 or even 50 bullets before having to reload. I know you want to keep adding more guns to your game but I think you should improve guns like this one.

And for my best solution, just make the damage greater. I think that people don't pick it up because of the damage it does, and if you increase it, I think it won't get hated so much as it is today. Even the smallest changes to damage can make a difference, maybe just by 5 damage. So, changing the damage just by a little bit might make such a big difference that many more people might take the gun and use it to their advantage.

So, make 2 differences, make one difference, or just don't make a difference at all. If you're Epic Games then you need to know that the Scoped AR is hated and you need to fix it. And if you just play fortnite then remember, don't hate the Scoped AR, because, when do you actually use the gun? I bet your answer is 'not usually'. And if it is, why do you have a reason to hate the gun if you haven't used the gun for a long time or just don't use the gun at all? Here's my advice; take the gun, use the gun, get better at the gun, get kills with the gun, win with the gun, thrive with the gun. And if you die, just give it another go, don't give up on that purple Scoped AR that you found in that one chest after at Snobby Shores or Pleasant Park. Keep working with the gun, stop hating on the gun, and just have some fun with it, soon enough you'll be really good at using the Scoped AR. And god, stop hating the gun, I've mentioned it plenty of times before, but it is very annoying to see that 20 videos have been posted on youtube, and how they say that ""The Scoped AR sucks"" and how ""The Scoped AR is ruining the game"" and ""The Scoped AR is the worst gun on Fortnite"". Just stop, okay?

And with that I'm gonna ask you, do you like the Scoped AR, or are you not cool with the gun? And with that just remember, this is my opinion, what's yours? ",FortNiteBR

Even if you're just playing casually at this point and youre a good player, you should be a John Wick. It's now not reserved for only the true top players, the ones who when shot once build a castle. While yes, some never put in the money to buy the Raven, Pink bear, or Tomato head skin, a majority of the top players do. John Wicks can be beat now, and we need to learn and accept as a community that John Wicks are just simply not what they once were.",FortNiteBR

I can safely say I have spent well over $1300 and will continue to spend money but I think for the hyped skins that people go crazy about like ""The Raven"" or ""Leviathan"" should be on their own section of the item shop that may only be available for a couple hours. Although there is ""Rare"" items in the game the only real thing that makes them rare were from the fact that most of the rare items were acquired in Season One and or Two when not as much people played. I simply think they should have a shop that maybe is only up for two hours that releases an actual rare skin into the game so it can expand from the collectors point of view. I just think that Fortnite when they release something that has the opportunity to be rare they always re\-post it on the item shop.

*this weapon sucks, vault it*

*this weapon is too powerful vault it*

And it’s getting tiring, specifically the crossbow and silenced SMG. Those two are the weapons that I’m constantly seeing people whine about. That both weapons are so weak that they need to be vaulted 

But the problem isn’t the weapons that suck.
It’s you, you just suck with the weapon. But that’s alright, not everyone can be a god at every single weapon in game. However just because you suck at using a weapon, does not mean it should be completely removed
For example: the silenced smg. Although it’s unsilenced brother has been vaulted it doesn’t mean that this one should be too. The smg serves one purpose: close quarters combat. It’s not meant to be a main weapon like the pulse or assault rifle. It’s meant to be a side arm like the pistol. It’s main purpose is to fill your opponent with bullets before they can react, with its high rate of fire it should accomplish it pretty easily.

However if you keep missing all your shot or your opponent keeps jumping like a dark voyager on steroids. If course you’re not going to deal any damage. Are there better alternatives? Yes, is the gun the worse gun in the game? Debatable, but in my opinion yes. However every game needs its trash weapons. Because who wants a game where everyone is running around with a gun blessed by the gods one shooting everybody before they could act? 

And finally the crossbow, the weapon that ticked me to make this post. I recently saw a post where someone was suggesting to remove the crossbow form the chest pool. And somebody else also suggested to add the crossbow to the vault

No, just no. The crossbow is a medium ranged **precision** weapon. It is not meant so snipe people 5000 meters away. That’s for the Bolt sniper. The crossbow is a sniping weapon, if you aren’t accurate. You will miss. But that’s the whole point of a sniping weapon. Just because you can’t aim, does not mean the weapon should be removed from the game.

What this sub is forgetting is that the game isn’t made to bend to your every whim. It’s a game that’s meant to be fun for **everyone**. Not just for yourself, not even just for this sub. It’s for everyone who plays the game. Open a chest and get a weapon you don’t like? Tough luck, deal with it. Adapt with the weapon, if you suck with that weapon. Then don’t engage the first person you see, keep hunting for a weapon you can use. Or look for ways to get better with the weapon. 

Sorry for the rant, I’m really tired of seeing the “vault this” posts and comments everywhere. It makes sense to vault a weapon such as the tracking rocket though. As the weapon was incredibly OP and game breaking.

After 180 solo games and like 200+ duos (which I don't care about), I had decided to make a new account, purely for solo.

Fast forward to today, the ~1300 solo games I have on this (not-so-new-anymore) account don't really reflect my current skill either (not only have I gone Tilted only for straight 400 matches or so, but I'm obviously a lot better than I used to be. After all, I moved to this account after mere 180 solo games on the original one). This fact alone doesn't bother me as much, because fortnitetracker has a new tab for eac season, so once season 4 hits, I'll have my clean slate and be able to track my progress. Also, I ended up playing Duos and Squads with my newb friends (which I don't mind whatsoever; as I said, I don't really care about these stats. I only care about solo).

Now to my point: The original account (from September) has the Skull Trooper skin, the Scythe pickaxe and now also Wiggle (I had 800 V-Bucks left over on that account so I just purchased it); pretty much, the only 3 things I feel like I need in this game (as of now). I bought these skins to support Epic (some of you guys might remember; we were all begging for a skin system to launch so we could support that awesome game), and now it's gotten to a point where I really miss them (as most of the community), and being able to play on this account is something that I actually consider (maybe actually keep it as my solo only account). 

What do you guys think? I know some of you might be able to relate while others will think I""m out of my mind, but I'd still like to hear your input. Also, the possibility of this skin never making a comeback is another factor (I mean, we can only assume that it'll make a return once Halloween approaches. But then again, Epic does see how many people cry about exclusivity, so they might actually release similar/new skins, and not the same one. We haven't had a full year circle yet, so we can't tell).

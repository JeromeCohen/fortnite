I had dropped in to the prison three circles ago. It was a bloodbath. Three kills later I was sneaking out of the wreckage half dead. I managed to find my way to an abandoned derelict farmhouse where I found some medical supplies, but the storm was on my ass. 

Run. Take shelter. Heal. Fight. Run.

I come out of an adrenaline filled daze and take in my surroundings. I'm in a shed somewhere on the outskirts of Anarchy Acres. I crouch my way through the cornfields. Two more have died by my hand since the prison. 

Now there are four of us.

I take shelter in the barn. A heated sniper battle rages outside. I have my trusty hunting rifle, but I can't find my enemies. 

A final loud crack. Now there are three.

For what seemed like minutes, but must have only been thirty seconds grenades rain down around my shelter. Someone had spotted me. I stealthily move up the stairs out of range, unsure that the barn won't all come crashing down around me.

I see movement. A tower being hastily constructed. Do I hide like a dog? Or do I fight? I know that there can be no hesitation. I take a breath to steady my nerves, ready my shotgun, and I charge.

Around and around we go up into the sky. ""I can't build! What am I doing!"" A voice screams in my head. It's true. I've never focused on building...never bothered to learn. The arrogance of it.

But I persevere. I use my foe's build against him, losing him in a maze of ramps and walls, roofs and floorboards. We are near the ground again. I have managed to injure my foe while my shield stands strong and I am unscathed. 

But where is my opponent?

From the left an eruption of fire can be heard. The third man! Before I can react it is over. My nemesis is dead.

There are two.

I do not see my final foe. The last obstacle standing before me and victory. 

Then, suddenly, silence. 

# #1 Victory Royale! 

My screen celebrates. 

My final opponent killed himself. Fell to his death out of the nightmare maze of wood and steel that I and my now-deceased nemesis created. 

I place down my controller. I don't feel cheated by this victory. So what if my opponent killed himself? I am content. I am victorious. I go to bed. It is around 11PM EST. 

I wake up and read the news. Stephen Hawking has died in the early hours of Wednesday at his home in Cambridge. 

The early hours of Wednesday? Well my victory was just past 11PM EST on Tuesday. That would be just past 3AM Wednesday in Cambridge, England. 

I'm not saying Stephen Hawking gave the last of his life force to influence my opponent into killing himself.

 I'm not saying that Stephen Hawking influenced the very fabric of our universe to aid me as his final act before departing this Earth.

All I'm saying is think about it.",FortNiteBR

But currently the games is basically down to one thing.

Action packed fights where you're likely going to die by getting sweeped or kill everything and not come out of titled with much, no shields/ heals left as its been used and likely on average loot.

Or drop anywhere else and sometimes get a fight at the beginning if people drop with you or you don't see anyone at all until there is like 25 people left.

It's killing mid game completely, after your initial drop location i usually don't see anyone until 20-30 left anymore, sometimes less. 

I've been in games where me and me squad/ duo have dropped greasy/ pleasant or retail and no one else dropped with us so after looting we don't see anyone until there is around 20 left and finish the game on low kills.

Even in the 20 v 20 game mode, most of the time if you dont drop titled you dont see anyone. Like 60 people always drop titled and it's a laggy mess where you struggle for ammo as you kill people and all that have is mats.

I really thing something needs to be done such as:

Remove tilted, replace it with something else and make it a separate map but double its size and make it a 50 player map or something.

Reduce the loot in hopes less people drop there.

Move it to somewhere not in the center of the map so when people do drop there they need to run for the circle sometimes in the hope that people stop dropping there because of it.

It's really annoying me now.

Shooting test 1 was a step in the right direction, now it's been about a month and we haven't had any points towards shooting test 2, no analysis on the data received from shooting test 1, absolutely nothing. 

Also, during this time you've added more bloom based weapons which are just inflating the game and are unpopular because nobody wants to pick them up to gamble whether they'll land a shot or not (deagle and hunting rifle) - both these weapons further demonstrate the issues bloom puts onto this game.

People aren't even bothering to get into AR fights anymore, it's either rush with a shotgun or just keep building for cover. Nobody wants to take the gamble whether their bullets will hit or not, because it's not in their control.

We really need to start seeing some more progress towards bloom's removal from the game, shooting test 1 was a good start but it's not enough by any means. So I'm asking, what update has been made to the bloom situation?",FortNiteBR

How it works for those that dont know is that Minecraft had a custom map which is divided into 4 parts (small map) in which people can loot and mine for resources which they are unable to cross to the other part of the map.
Then, at the 10 min mark the walls drop and u can either stay at the fort u build or play aggressively and destory the other players fort.

This gamemode in fortnite should be insanely fun where it provides the intended gameplay of looting and farming resources and mainly building a fort without any issue from the other team.

I feel that with this gamemode you can really showcase the building aspect of the game (create an enormous fort or castle)

So what im proposing is :
1. Best would be a custom map that is smaller than the orginal map and divided into 2/3/4 parts
2.Players can loot and build the fort before the wall drops at maybe 5/10 min
3.Players can then destory other play fort or just snipe each other

TLDR; Custom (small) map w 4 parts divided by a wall. Players can loot and build castles until the 5 min mark where the wall drops and chaos begins

EDIT: Idk if there would be any kind of copyright issues but if the devs can pull something off like this... dam this would b fking insane",FortNiteBR

Right now there are literally thousands of people streaming Fortnite on Twitch, with over 60,000 people spectating, and it's the quietest time of day!

So my idea would be that you can link your Twitch with your Fortnite using your stream key.

In Solos, nothing would be visible to opposing players until after they are killed - then, once spectating there is a 'LIVE NOW' banner, with your Twitch channel name.

In Duos, the same as above would happen to villain players, but your team mate can also see a red 'live' icon next to your name, and your Twitch channel is visible under your icon in the start screen.

In Squads, the same as above applies.

I feel like this would help the smaller streamers a lot. Even if they just get 1 or 2 people drop in for a few minutes to watch after they've been killed it would give smaller streamers that sense of accomplishment and encourage them to continue streaming, and henceforth advertising Fortnite to even more people.

Feedback appreciated...",FortNiteBR

I'll keep being that extra bunny making up the numbers for now. But is there such thing as leveled matchmaking or am I just in for a constant world of hurt while I try'n find me feet?

As you can see from the picture, the storm hasn't even reached the island yet, but there's only 32 players remaining. This has become nearly every game now. Landing anywhere else besides tilted leads to a non existent mid game where you run for miles without hearing a single gunshot. I landed at the Rec center (new spot with the indoor soccer field, pool, and garage) with one other person, and didn't see another until I got to the gas station between pleasant &amp; loot lake (You can see him in the screenshot). I'm not entirely sure how to balance it out, but some ideas I've had were:

1. Split Tilted in half. Put one half on the north side of loot lake in the empty space between it and Anarchy, and the other half either where it is now, or put it where the RV campsite is and have it come right up to the shore of loot lake. This would really shake up loot lake but let's be honest, it's not a good location anyways. Too little loot for as spead out as it is, especially since you either have to run all the way around or waste tons of mats building across it.

2. Remove some buildings from Tilted, maybe take some floors out of the taller buildings. There's entirely too many places for loot to spawn. Anywhere you land you're within about 10 ft of a loot spawn it seems.

3. Buff other locations. Say you land at retail. In the entire shopping strip, there's 5 (6 if you count water tower) possible chests, spread out over a wide area. Compare this to Tilted, where you can barely walk 10 ft without tripping over a chest. Even worse if you compare to something like Wailing Woods (Week 2 challenge flashbacks).

4. Replace Tilted Towers with a smaller or less dense location. Something like Lucky Landing, the prison, the unnamed container yard, etc. This will never happen, but I can dream.

5. Swap it's location with Snobby Shores, Junk Junction, or Flush Factory. Part of what makes it such an appealing landing zone is that 99% of the time, the storm won't eliminate it for the majority of the game due to it being right in the center of the map. Maybe if people knew they'd have to run from the storm soon after landing, they'd rethink landing there. 

6. Remove it entirely. There was nothing there before, and it was mostly fine. Especially now that there's so many more locations nearby, it's absence wouldn't be missed by me at all.

 I just feel like overall it's made the game significantly worse than it was before. Even watching YouTube vids or twitch streams has gotten stale since wouldn't you know it, everyone always lands at Tilted. No variety anymore. Challenges that require ""Top 50, or top 25 placements are a joke now, just dont land at Tilted and you're basically guaranteed to get it. Anyways, those are just a few ideas off the top of my head. Everyone else feel free to throw in your own ideas. /rant",FortNiteBR

It’s a gamemode where you pay to enter a match. 

Cost: 10 VBucks.

Winners get all inserted VBucks!

So basically if you enter a match for 10 VBucks and win, you leave with 1,000 VBucks! That would be extremely fun to try to win and farm VBucks. It would have no loss to Epic and the best players could benefit from many wins. Remember it’s only 10 VBucks to enter ( 10 cents) and you can leave with 10 dollars worth of VBucks. 

Duo and squad would be half and a quarter as much for winners to split between victors.

Honestly, I don't blame people for dropping out in the middle of no where. At least they'll end up in the final circle with shields instead of killing 7 people in the first 2 minutes, chasing balloons to and up with 75-125 health just to get mobbed by some full shielded grey weaponed scrub who took his time. It's already too full of tryhards. One of my friends and some of his other friends won a game about a week after it came out, now as soon as they land they are getting blasted with RPGs and grenades.

I could very easily be wrong as people saw it in the store for PC and some consoles, but it makes sense that they make  he discounted version for mobile and sell the skin for full price on Pc and Console. 

Honestly nothing could stop someone from purchasing it on mobile and sharing it across their accounts if they are all connected but still.

Anyways, he just asked me to get him a battle pass. I was looking around and I saw he game also has standard, deluxe, super deluxe etc. I was thinking of getting him the deluxe since I figure it comes with 8 characters, which IMO is better than a limited time season pass, right?

Should I get him that? Or will the characters eventually become free once the game is released?

I'm just a bit confused whether it's worth shelling out $80 bucks for deluxe (CAD). Please direct me, I'm looking for something that will provide him with longevity in a one-time purchase , since I figure it's better than buying battle passes every other month. ",FortNiteBR

Help? Suggestions?","I'm trying here after emailing their customer support and leaving 2 phone messages on their NC line.

On 3/9/18 I received two receipt emails while sitting at work about purchases made on my Epic Games account (The only Epic game I play is Fortnite) through my linked PayPal. I immediately googled and called Epic Games only to have to leave a message.

 I changed my password and unlinked my PayPal account, then contacted PayPal to dispute the two separate charges made (one for 99.99 and one for 109.99) and explained the situation to their resolution center. I've been told it would take 2 weeks to investigate.

In the meantime, I contacted my bank and  explained the situation. The charge had not come through yet so I went to the bank and emptied the checking account it was set to draw from (I can't really afford to lose 210$). The next day, my account is hit for $208.98 and my account is taken into the negative. I call WF back and they issue a stop payment for Paypal

I try calling Epic again, no response, so I log into my ancient unused twitter account and try that. Nothing. 

At this point I receive an early message from PayPal basically stating; hey this account was authorized, go fuck yourself. No surprise here, as I think PP is garbage, but it's very irritating none the less. Why the hell do I choose PayPal as a processor? Security. What do they do when I have a problem? Tell me to pick rocks.

Anyway, I'm trying this subreddit as I saw in a other post on r/Fortnite some type of Epic representative contacted the OP (I think? Paranoid about scams now).

I didn't click on any phishing emails nor do I believe there are ANY ways to get free V-bucks. I only linked my Epic account to FB and PayPal. 

Additionally, both receipts state that whoever as on my account bought Fortnite products in Cyrillic. As I don't read or write Cyrillic or Russian I'm not sure what exactly they purchased or how they'd be able to send it to their account(?).

I'm afraid that once (if?) the payment issue is resolved they will immediately ban my account, but at this point the money is more important than my account. I did pay for the game and bought V bucks originally so that would also be a loss. :/

Any suggestions Reddit? Thank you!",FortNiteBR

I looked the #1 guy up and it turns out he already has 2 solo wins with a K/D ratio of 0.5 (-_-)and 140 matches played, I have a K/D ratio of 1.2 and played 300 mathes... So I was wondering what K/D ratio you had before you got your firs solo win!?

This brings me to my point. I recently reached tier 79 on this season’s battle pass, and got the trusty no. 2 pickaxe. Upon using it, I discovered it had a special sound that played when hitting other players with it. Im not sure if Epic would change this, but I feel that, like the pick squeak, the sound should play whenever it hits something, not only other players. Tell me what you guys think about this!

I’m not great at the game but it seems like every squad fight we get into now we lose. The other squad is able to turn the fight around much easier.

Epic has emphasized the fort building aspect of fortnite and the strategies involved over raw FPS skill alone. And I am a huge proponent of the game mechanics and strategy involved in fortnite.

Given that duo, Squad, teams of 20, and solo require various different styles of play to pull off the Dubya, unofficially, I have added different roles.

My play style is that of a heavy support. I prefer stacking bandages or medkits and rockin' a blue burst or a shotgun and making sure I'm farming up materials to build. While my teammates are more comfortable with sniper rifles and AR's for the Long Engagement. When my teammates are Marching up ramps and taking potshots, I'm hanging back checking our flank, building additions and editing, and healing up anybody who may go down. 

While early game is either about every man for himself while you do a hot drop, or Landing somewhere remote so you all have time to get your wits about you. Mid game is more focused on each teammates falling more into their role. This is why it's important to be able to play several different roles with your teammates. And all the more importance of communication. Finally, late game is when you'll see the most impact of a 5 man squad

This is why I think of 5 man squad mode would add a whole new layer to the game, building upon what is already in place.

If you think to other team games like League of Legends or Dota 2 you have players who play jungler, support, carry, and sometimes a combination. At this time, duo is a very complex mode where each player takes on multiple roles. Squad has in my opinion been the most successful when players take on a single role. This is where I think adding an extra person to the Squad game mode would be an excellent idea. This would allow more players to play the jungle, support roles and focus on Gathering materials and building forts while three players focus on defending and attacking. The reason that this mode would see increased focus on building would be because of the decreased team sizes. Only the best teams will keep five people around and have the best base built. And combinations of this. You will see the best teams be able to build bases as the storm eye closes and then be able to move and build more bases as a storm shrinks.

I obviously think the game is amazing, and of course I won't be mad at these changes don't take effect. But I think with the teams of 20 mode we have seen an extreme reverse version of this. And we have seen those Mega bases at the end with all of the resources of 20 people. Therefore I think that a squad of five would be a great mode and would really launch this game into a whole new dimension of play styles, tactics, and strategies",FortNiteBR

I believe they should completely scrap the house and the small secondary island and add two separate 3 to 4 story castles with a slim bridge that spans from one side of the lake to the other, while also passing through both castles to connect them with a chest on the bridge in between the castles.

 This would:

 A) make loot lake actually worth it to drop at because your chances at good loot would be much higher because of the extra chests/weapon spawns 

B) make for much more exciting fights between the castles 

C) (imo the most important edition) make it so you are very rarely forced to build right over the lake to escape the storm, you can just make your way to the bridge and use it to pass through. It would be a risk to use the bridges because they would act as choke points for escaping the storm or for simply leaving the castles after you loot them.

Got this idea from the redditor who originally came up with a cool design for the Haunted Hills castles with the draw bridge in between(forgot your name sorry pal)

It makes fighting people very tedious at times.

I had this idea that if we have health kits on the inventory we should be able to self-heal when downed, with the downside of - for example - the process taking twice as long than if you weren't downed. This also opens the possibility that teammates can just drop a health kit next to you and keep on shooting enemies, instead of having to stop action solely to revive you. Or another situation where you're just crawling around and come across health loot from other players. Obviously you would be exposed crawling around trying to find a quiet place to self-heal, but at least you'd still have a bigger chance to stay in the game rather than just waiting for someone.

Any thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Here’s the premises:

* The major basis of this game mode is taking Fortnite BR back to how it started. While I love the constant additions, there are definitely times I reminisce on the old style. By old, I mean around the time of November right before the game exploded.

* This mode could start as a LTM, and if it is popular enough, it could maybe become a permanent mode.

* Most importantly of all, which I feel would be the biggest draw to the game as well as the biggest change, this game mode would be on the old map! No tilted towers, no haunted hills, no lucky landing, no junk junction, and none of the other stuff added along with that update. This would create a massively different play style redirecting the 20+ people that land at titled towers and making the mid-game feel the way it used to.

* Some major things I believe this game mode should have are: the original guns in the game(no crossbows or silenced weapons, etc.), the original consumables(no mini shields or chug jugs), and also no extra grenades(such as the smoke or impulse).

* This mode could be solo or squads. I personally have no data to see which one is more popular, but I would say choose the one that has more players.

* Lastly, I believe this game mode would only work if all of the main quality of life or major game mechanics remain as they are now. And by that, I mean the game mode should maintain things such as nerfed double pump, increased SMG damage, new building mechanics, etc.

I tried my best to outline my idea for this game mode. I am 100% open to suggestion as I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts and improvements. I hope to see other long-time players support this, and if we are lucky we can relive the nostalgic feeling of when we first got the game. Sorry for it being such a long post, thank you for reading and have a nice day.",FortNiteBR

Playing 20v20 I watched probably 12 people run right over gold mini-guns.  Gold and purple hand-cannons littered the streets.  My squad and I often leave impulse grenades behind for more viable healing items.  The silenced pistol is really sweet, but if it's between that and a rifle or a medkit, the pistol just isn't worth it.  What i'm getting at is that a lot of items have sort of specific uses and causes them to be left behind pretty often in favor of more certain and practical items.

We have how many new items now?  Simply put, *eventually* we're going to need more room or much of what Epic puts out is going to be left lying on the ground.  I'd like to play with impulse grenades more but a chance to have some fun won't take priority over a medkit with guaranteed effect.  Now we have C-4...  An entire inventory slot taken up for an item with one specific purpose.  Same with mini-gun, they get left laying around.  This doesn't mean they aren't useful, it's just with such limited space, and most people have a rifle/shotty/sniper, many of these new items are going to be left behind.

Can we consider a slot just for healing items?

A slot just for throwables i.e. grenades, boogy bomb, impulse, C4? 

Let's face it, a minigun is not going to be as viable and overall useful for you as a medkit or a stack of small shield pots.  I also don't think being able to have both would  break or alter the game in a negative way.  I'd really love a way to let us play with some of the more specific use items without having to sacrifice core components of our build.",FortNiteBR

I love FPS games. I have played CS for 15 years along with other shooters as well. I have over 4000 hours in CSGO, but while playing Fortnite I feel like a guy who just found out what a keyboard and mouse is. Don't get me wrong, I can definitly get kills and I have won a few games. VERY few tho. 5 wins out of 170 matcher, 2,9% win rate.


I get it, it takes time to get a hang of a new game. But I feel like I should be better than I am with my background in gaming, especially FPS games. I have spent between 30 minutes to 4 hours every day for the last 3 weeks watching streams, helpful videos on youtube as well as play with the newly gathered information in mind to up my gameplay but it doesn't feel like much has changed.

What us
ually happens is that I land, usually not in tilted, I get a few guns and 1 or possibly 2 kills before I run to the next zone. I gather new loot, some materials on the way and head for the late game with anything between 1-5 kills. 10 people left..... 8 left.... 4 left... Dead. EVERY single time I die in the late game. I can almost always make it to the top 5 with building and putting pressure but there is always someone with an RPG/GL killing me or two people shooting me from multiple sides etc etc. I can never manage to get the win. The few times that I actually do make it to the top 2, I get so nervous and I don't know what the fuck to do essentially so I die every single time.

 
Not sure if this was a rant or a cry for help on what I can do better, but I would like to think it's the latter. Pls halp.

 

TLDR;
I can make it to top 10 in 80% of my games but have a 2,9% win rate. Wtf am I supposed to do?

In conclusion, the smartest option is to probably make a whole new map, maybe a different theme, like a wooded map, a snowy map or a completely urban map, who knows? Each map could add a new layer to the game which could entice new players.

Hi! So I'm a MOBA type of guy, I used to play a ton of Paragon, Dota 2, HoN, Smite, Strife, Vainglory, and LoL. Recently, after Paragon's imminent death in April, I haven't had really any games to play because all MOBA metas rn are horrible rn (tank metas). 

Any-who, I have been playing some fortnite recently and I've heard that TSM got a competitive team going. I want to know, how can this game be competitive? It feels really, like REALLY RNG and luck based. I just have a couple of questions about the ""RNG"" of the game. I know some people may say ""it's not RNG, just get good"", but I believe every player should be on an even playing field in a competitive game (I strongly emphasize the word ""competitive"") 

Q1- Why do gun tiers exist? I don't understand why having a gun do more damage based off of color exists? Why does a blue pistol do more damage than a green pistol? The same gun, but different color tier? That feels really unfair if both players are at an equal skill level (one has an advantage).

Q2 - Maybe there is an algorithm or something based on player location or jump timings, but I've noticed loot spawns are REALLY random. I can go in a house and find a SMG while a dude can just find a SCAR lying around in the same house. I've noticed when I play a lot I go inside buildings and open a door to find a measly pistol, where as other players in the same house / building, find a shotgun and now (with a logical analysis), I'm kinda screwed. If that player and I are on equal ""competitive"" skill levels, I will lose that matchup 99.9% of the time. That doesn't feel fair that I got punished (killed) all because I went into the ""wrong room"" by just chance. 

Q3 - Maybe I am mistaken, but it feels like guns in this game have just a random bullet pattern / recoil and NO pattern. This does not feel fair. It feels like when I tap fire (0.5 second intervals) my bullets just fly everywhere.. I mouse my mouse (or controller, depending on what I'm playing on) down to compensate but it feels like that doesn't help. 

My main problem with Fortnite is more of the ""Early Game"" than the late game, because by late game (top 20 / top 10, maybe?) most people will have the same weapons (but probably different tiers of that weapon). Does anyone mind explaining why Epic has these systems in the game? I know PUBG has the same thing (loots spawns), but they do NOT have color gun tiers (to my basic knowledge, I never played PUBG too much, less than 15 games, found that kinda unfair too). 

Oh, and I know some people may just say ""drop somewhere secluded"", and yes, that does stop the deaths, but I just sit around doing nothing for 6-10 minutes while everyone in Tilted Towers just slaughters one another (I have a problem with Tilted from a competitive standpoint as well, but it's more of a map design thing).

TLDR - Why does Epic have the game so RNG based and how can people can take this game ""competitively"" based on all the RNG elements of the early game. 

I don't want to sound hateful or anything, but I would just genuinely like to know why people take this game so competitively and seriously, that's all! I think the game is fun, casually, but it does not feel like a competitive game at all, it feels quite frustrating to die all because I didn't get the better weapon at the start / not having highest colored tier gun! 

Thanks for reading, God Bless (I'm making this from MOBILE so I apologize if it's not fancy and or ""perfectly constructed"")!

(Oh, and I know MOBAS have some RNG, like crit%, but that's another topic for another day). ",FortNiteBR

Like I said earlier for most of us kid or adult it doesn't matter this has little to no meaning to us at all, but to that psycho path sitting at home living in his fantasy world, all day he's dropping from a school bus killing people. I think with how popular Fortnite has become, changing the battle bus, or school bus as it is, to something else could potentially help save lives.

I don't record my gameplay (at least not yet), so I don't have any captures to back up my points about this but I don't think I'm the only one frustrated.

I've been playing this game since the earliest versions and only recently did I notice that the shotguns have become HIGHLY inconsistent; so much so that I've switched to the tactical SMG for most situations - but even then, one shotgun blast and I'm dead. 

I feel like I'm being pigeonholed into HAVING to use the shotguns even though the only consistent thing about them is their inconsistency. 

For a while, I was pretty adamant that dying by the shotguns meant you were outgunned in CQ or just didn't know how to counter them. And, to some extent, that's still true but with every game I play that perception is changing. 

I don't experience the same level of frustration from any of the other guns in the game nor have I ever been this frustrated about a weapon in a game. I'm refining my controls, testing counter strategies, building like a MF, unloading AR and SMG rounds, and desperately trying to gauge some pattern with the shotguns. It seems like nothing works, especially when lag is present. The shotguns are just, literally, hit or miss without a solid counter unless you want to start hip-firing snipers. 

Is there a solution on the horizon? Is there a solid strategy to counter? Should I wait until the shotties get fixed or go in the Vault? I love this game and I'll keep playing it but I'd also love to not be KO'd from 200 HP with one shot.",FortNiteBR

Ettnix opinion has been shared by other popular Fortnite players as well such as Ninja.

Why then, does Reddit tend to think the game is fine as is, oversaturated, or call these fun items (like the Jetpack) an unneeded gimmick?

Also, I've said all along that these fun items are going to be what seperates Fortnite from the competition.

We let ourselves get kicked off the bus and pull immediately and glide into a tree. Once we’re not around the circle we try to find some common guns people left behind. After that we get 500 wood each and build into trees and shoot our staircases down until there is like 10 people left. We let the other teams fight then cleanup for the win. We got a back to back doing their then a couple games later I 1v2d for another win. Camping is OP if you know how to play properly.,FortNiteBR

**A:** To participate, you’ll need an internet connection and iOS 11 on at least an iPhone 6S/SE, iPad Mini 4, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad 2017 devices or later.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Will Mobile players be forced to play with other platforms?   
**A:** No. By default, mobile players are matched against mobile players only. When a mobile player joins a squad with friends on other platforms, then that squad is matchmade against a multiplatform population. Thus, cross platform play is opt in.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** I got an invite, where do i download the game?   
**A:** In the invitation email, you will receive a link to download the game from the iOS App Store. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Will Bluetooth controllers work?   
**A:** Not initially. Bluetooth controller support is coming later.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Is Save the World coming to mobile?   
**A:** No. Save the World uses way more memory and CPU resources than Battle Royale and would be very difficult to bring to mobile devices.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Will the game eventually be open to everyone, regardless of having an invite?   
**A:** Yes. As soon as we are able to handle the scale of players, the game will be open to everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

**Q:** Will there be voice chat?   
**A:** Not initially. Later, we plan to support voice chat.

&amp;nbsp;

Cheers,

It makes hitting your shots long range impossible or going for headshots and it’s only on consoles, PC the reticle is untouched making PC having even more of an unfair advantage if you decide to do cross-platform.
In my opinion if you are going to make such a drastic change like messing with the reticle it should be across all platforms and not just on the consoles. 
Hopefully they’ll fix it and bring back the old dot.

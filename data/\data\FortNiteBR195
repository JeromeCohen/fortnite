This post is on response to [this one here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9mq3lb/fortnite_ranking_concept_players_are_getting/) which got quite a lot of traction today on the frontpage. So let's just jump straight to the points:

- First off, Battle Royale is a RNG based game. You might be the best of the best, that sometimes a pistol can only do so much against an RPG if your first loot is awful. This breaks the skill barrier almost completely. Again, a very skilled player against a poor one might outperform on this situation, but ranking is about putting people of similar ability together, so don't get your hopes up homie. Also include, storm rotations, and a changing map. These factors are also somewhat RNG, and the player can't fully adapt to them, no matter the skill. When the first scrimmages took place it was evident that even the best teams sometimes struggled, and you can't build a competitive around the fact that you might loose a certain % of your matches **just because yes**.
- Second: it's unsustainable. A month or so ago, one user asked Epic why couldn't we have a gamemode like Soaring skies on Solo, Duo, Squads and 50v50 all at once and had to rely on a weekly rotation. An Epic employer answered telling him that even though it was possible since their servers could support it, it was ill-advised since it implicated creating parallel lobbies that had to fill with a hundred people each. Now, take a ranked mode with different skill matchmakings, which means you cannot pair up with at least two thirds of the players, plus the normal Solo, Duo and Squad gamemodes and the Playground. It might work on NA or EU, since they are big servers. But Oceania? you'd be playing a lobby of 20 people or waiting 20 minutes to join a game, and that's not what Epic Games wants.

- On the third point, this is a hard reality: if you suck, it's not because the pro comes and wipes the floor with you every time. You suck because you suck. The actual gameplay is actually the best you could ask for to improve: you have on every game players above, below and on your skill level, which means that you get to practice, improve and test your play style while also pointing out your flaws. If you get stuck in a mode with everyone at your level that room for improvement sizes down significantly. You won't face a real challenge, and you will not get a chance to practice skills with an easy target either. We all began sucking lemons on this game, so if some people got better it's because they invested time on it. Some people may be talented, some other will take a lot of time. But if you persevere you'll come to get what you long for.

This is it. Any objection you have, reply to this post, I'm open to civilized debates. I'll also add stuff if I feel like I'm missing some points.

It's great for practicing skills you need to work on and has played a critical role in a lot of peoples improvement in the game.

I think it has also widened the gap between casual players and those that play everyday.  Your casual player isn't going to take the hour they planned on playing and spend it all in playground mode to hammer down specific skills, they just want to get out there and play a few games.

Before only the elite players like pros and streamers that play all day were master builders and editors.  The majority of players only had a handful of building basics and improvised from there, now daily players know a handful of moves to get out of very specific situations.  In playground you can also get very comfortable playing great players in build battles, etc giving you more experience in certain situations.

It has also lead to people finding mechanics to exploit that may have never been discovered before.  Staying on top of all of these is very important in being able to compete against other good players.  Even taking as little as a week off you could miss out on a dozen new mechanics/skills.  Your average player isn't going to keep up with these either further widening the skill gap.

Is playground mode good for the game in the long run?  Yes it is extremely helpful for people to get better and practice but it is also slowly alienating your average/below average player more and more.  I think it was odd for Epic to nerf mats in an effort to reduce the skill gap, but then permanently add playground which is mainly an area for already good players to get better and better.

TLDR/ELI5: Good player get much better, bad player get no better, skill gap get bigger.  Playground good or playground doo doo for game future? ",FortNiteBR

Literally.,"Ever since the 6.0 patch i have noticed a huge increase in game breaking bugs. I think it is time we discuss these bugs because this is the worst time for fortnite to be nearly unplayable with the upcoming releases of new battle royal games.

First we have the “playdough” buildings in which case the player literally can’t enter the building, harvest through the walls, or see any floor loot inside. This has always been in the game but it has became nearly unbearable since 6.0

Next we have “ghost hitmarkers” which are when someone shoots a player then instantly switches to either a different weapon or the build menu but the switch is too quick and the shot doesn’t register despite showing all red hit markers. This can be very frustrating and has been happening a lot more since the 6.0 update.

Finally the most important and game breaking bug that I have noticed increased tenfold with the recent patch. Invisible players have been popping up EVERYWHERE. Sometimes right off the drop in a hot spot, sometimes in the middle of the game. The shadow stones may have some effect to this increase in invisible people, but are not the only cause as sometimes it is right off the drop in tilted where corrupted zones are too far. 

I speak for a lot of people when I say that I love this game. I play it more than I have ever played any game before. But recently with the huge increase in these game breaking bugs, I have found myself in a bit of slump. Time and time again I die to something I just could do a thing about. 

Epic please look into these.",FortNiteBR

I have about 2k games played since starting in August and I feel like I am not really improving. My main issue outside of dying before I can even find a weapon is build fights. I have never won a build fight, not even once. I just cant seem to figure out how people are so fast at getting above me. Even when I do manage to get up high, I fall down or get shot down before I can find the other player. I have never played a game for so long and felt like so little progress has been made. Does anyone have any advice for how I can work at this? I am almost 30 so I don't have any friends I can take into playground mode to practice with and practicing in game isn't practical because people in game are already so fast at building that I'm dead before I have a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I've played every single season, and I have to say, season 4 is on par or even better than some of the other seasons.

This was because of:

* Map changes every week
* Large scale events like the rocket launch.
* The skins were good, with the exception of Zoey and Valor, the battle pass was really good.
* Meta was fair. You could do well with any weapon, if you were good enough, SMGs weren't OP. only exception to this was rocket spam.
* Building was fun. Season 4 was the peak of building imo, seasons 2 and 3 made it harder for you to play if you weren't good at building, while now it's too weak.
* The addition of new items into the game.
* Shopping carts.",FortNiteBR

1) Make the shotguns cock. If you shoot pump #1, you can immediately switch to pump #2, but switching back to pump #1 will result in cocking the gun before shooting, which applies to switching back to pump #2 too. The cocking should be removed after 3 seconds to not mess with people using shotgun-SMG and for longer duration fights.

2) Make the speed at which you can double shotgun only the speed at which you can shoot the shotgun normally. So if you use double pump, you can only fire at the speed of that of a single pump. Same applies to the heavy, tac and double barrle.

I honestly believe these are much more viable solutions to what Epic has offered and offered in the past. Newer players probably has no idea why they have to sit and wait 4 seconds to shoot a weapon they didn't use and I think this is a good option. Personally I'd prefer solution 1, as it is more realistic.",FortNiteBR

The old fortnite felt better because you allwa9had a way to counter other weapons, if you had a purple tac you could counter that with the purple tac smg. My point is that now fortnite feel less like a compeative game and more like a unfair RNG random chance game. I never run the Smg in ever because I feel like a premovirgin when I use it. All I'm saying is that the Smgs need to be reworked or removed and replaced with the old smg because they felt balanced and fair. Don't argue with me if your point is about shotguns being able to counter Smgs because I've already talked about that. I personally feel like the weapon sandbox could use some new weapons like a heavy revolver or semi auto pistol. ",FortNiteBR

I’ll preface with my scenario, maybe some of you can relate; I play on PS4 and have been trying to get my stream off the ground. Unfortunately, my only way of spreading name is by word of mouth as I cant change my username(currently not possible on PS4). Even if I could, I wouldnt want my name to be my TTV name for every other game I play. 

THE PROPOSAL:
I’d like to see a streamer mode where you can link and verify your Twitch/Youtube/Mixer account to your EPIC account (something you can already do with Twitch) and add your link as a subtitle to your username. This subtitle would appear under the users name while Spectating them if you are eliminated and under their victory message “______ won the game!”. This way the user has earned the ability to show off their channel and gain an audience. 

The current Streamer Mode should be changed to “Anonymous Mode” which keeps all current elements and only display others subtitles if someone wins the game (which shows the winners username anyway). 

This would help streamers gather traction (especially on console) and hopefully reduce the number of people with TTV in their name and those needlessly using the current streamer mode. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

My cousins will be shooting at the guy who downed me and he’ll ignore them and just thirst me for a kill, getting slaughtered by my teammates in the process. I’ll sit there and think “wow, this guy is an idiot” and I’ll look at his stats - Lo and behold, 0 wins and a KD under 1. 

It’s not exclusive to being thirsted while you’re downed though. You land and don’t get a gun? Some dude who only has a common pistol will stalk you for his first ever kill. They neglect getting mats, a better gun, or ammo. Look up their stats, same situation. Not to mention they’ll die very shortly after. 

Then there’s also camping, people hide behind doors with double barrels and get a few kills and think they’re nice. Sadly, they’re so used to playing passive that they’re infinitely more likely to choke because they don’t practice having build offs/using guns other than shotguns/are used to sitting in one area that the bad habit is ingrained into their brain which automatically prevents them from getting better. It’s the same scenario, few wins and a low KD. 

In essence, I realized that people who play with tunnel vision and make it their personal mission to kill you and ignore everything else are just bad players. There’s 100 people dropping, don’t put all of your fixation into one guy. Or at the very least if you do, check your ass and make sure you’re not getting third partied/their teammates aren’t coming for you. 

People say ‘a good player eliminates a player before they become a threat’ or something along those lines but I never see good players using any of the strategies I mentioned - at least not in the conventional sense. 

Anyways, is it a coincidence that the people who are guilty of camping, tunnel vision, stalking people who don’t have guns, etc usually have bad stats? It’s pretty obvious that these strategies are more harmful than they are good, I wish this sub would stop treating these things like legitimate play styles, you’re ruining somebody else’s experience because you can’t play like the rest of us and are definitely not going to get better. None of these strategies take skill, you’re just getting comfortable with certain styles that are ineffective most of the time. You almost certainly won’t win by camping and you definitely can’t win if you ignore my teammates that are shooting at you because you have tunnel vision and want a kill. 


Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results. That’s pretty much how I categorize all of these non-skillful playstyles. Can’t get better at building if you hide in a corner all day. Can’t get better at shooting if you don’t engage anyone. Can’t get win a game if you ignore when you’re being shot at, and so forth. 

To all the new players, playing a certain way is fine. It’s a good way to get acclimated to the game BUT, you’ll never get better if you consistently put yourself in a position to set short term goals rather than trying to win. ",FortNiteBR

Pump- should be gray and green and do 90/95 with 2X headshot

Tac- should be blue and purple and basically an upgraded version of the pump that is more accurate, faster fire rate and reload, does 100/105 and holds 7 as opposed to 5 with the pump. A 2X headshot makes it the first shotgun that can 1 shot a full health enemy. 

Double barrel- purple and gold does 150/170 and 2X headshot with large damage drop off.

Heavy shotgun- should shoot a slug instead of pellets. So there are no partial hits does 125/140 and has a minimum damage after drop off of 40

I was sick of constantly getting trashed by kids that had two pumps and were just demolishing my head from what felt like any distance, I was currently just browsing YouTube and stumbled across a recommended video that was a 12 minute double pump compilation. If you guys want the link I'll link it but as of right now I won't because I don't want people thinking I'm just promoting whoever this YouTuber is. During this time I couldn't quite double pump as well as everyone else, but I absolutely loved being able to switch from a pump to a tac  mid fight. This was my calling and helped me rise a lot as a player and when it was removed I felt like a piece of my identity was taken. (Mind you I do see why these changes were implemented as like I said it was definitely a big problem in the meta of Season 2 and 3.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Problem"": People were concerned that the double pump was way too over powered and completely overtook the meta, watching this video really gave me a lot of insight on just how bad players were in these early stages of the game (Season 2 and Season 3) because throughout the entire compilation I want to say maybe one or two players tried building against the streamer (who was in the clip double pumping). These days it doesn't feel like that at all, I run into ChickenJoe503's all the time now who are if not moderate but sometimes even GOOD at building. Not to mention materials getting that little initial health buff would double pumping even be considered a problem in this meta? Forget double pumping but even just having two shotguns as a whole? I feel like the pump and tac both have gotten a lot weaker over time and if they were to revert their shotgun nerfs the meta wouldn't drastically change. I also feel like it would bring a little more diversity back to the inventory because even if it isn't meta or the best you can offer, players would still use double shotgun for fun and nostalgia reasons. What is your opinion on this and what measures do you think would need to be taken to bring double shotguns back?

&amp;#x200B;

\*P.S. I know this is kind of memed about and a lot of people talk about bringing double shotguns back, but honestly I feel like none of those posts bring up how the majority of the player base has increased in skill since those early Seasons and I really wanted some insight from better players why bringing double shotguns back would be a problem or a good solution for diversity in the inventory.\*",FortNiteBR

You’re not doing anybody favors, you look like an ass hole. 

You got sniped from 350 meters away? Get good, you’re trash. 

You landed at the biggest building in tilted and only found mats/bandages/a common pistol? Lol land better. RNG doesn’t exist, it’s your fault, right? 

Seriously, if you’re not going to offer some actual advice or try to help others get better, keep your passive aggressive comments to yourself. Nobody cares that you’re an OG, not everyone has been playing long enough to understand/be an elite player. 

Besides, most of the game when you first land is luck. It’s all about who finds the better guns/more shields within the first 30 seconds. It’s not about getting good or landing better, it’s about getting lucky (at first, at least) 

Fwiw, I’ve been playing since season 2, I just hate when these people with 5KDs think their opinions are absolute because they’re better at the game. There’s no right or wrong way or play, don’t insult others just because they’re not as sweaty as you. 


TL;DR, stop being toxic just because you’re good at the game. If anything, toxic behavior makes this game unplayable. Stop discouraging other people, build each other up instead or shitting on others because they’re not as good as you. ",FortNiteBR

 it has been now 1 month and half  that i switched to mouse and keyboard , my building improved a lot but when i m in a fight i rarely build, if someone took the high ground i try to stay low and i feel i still play like when i was on controller

i replugged my controller and basically i do the same thing  as pc ( on pc i build, faster ) but my aim in close fight is a lot better ( been playing controller for years now)

should i keep playing mouse and keyboard or get back on controller

Epic got rid of double pump, it's not possible anymore, it is also not possible to 1 shot kill a fully shielded enemy.

Sure I agree with both changes, but the pump needs a damage buff.

I had a blue pump, this guy was right in front of me, not super close but at a distance where the season 2 pump would deal 200 damage, I shoot him, and I hit the pellets and do only 135. Which is ridiculously terrible.

Pump should be able to do much more damage than that especially being that close.

There is no reason to use the pump right now, the heavy shoots faster and does more damage, the tactical shoots faster, what are the pros of the pump compared to this two? It should definitely be the one that hits harder.

Pros of Heavy shotgun:
•Longest Range
•Most damage
•decent rate of fire

Pros of Tactical:
•Fast shooting
•8 ammo magazine

Pros of pump:
•??????

I'm not saying it should one shot kill, but definitely do more damage at a close range, I know the pump can do up to 170+ but that is literally if you're kissing the enemy.",FortNiteBR

There’s tonnes of YouTube and Twitter comments out there totally hating on the new seasons just wanted to hear some more reasonable discussion,"Here’s my take on it all. The game is much better now than it was when it came out back in September 2017. There are less bugs, it’s easier to build, the map has a lot more going on etc. That being said I enjoyed the game more back in the times of pre-season 1 up until season 3. The game was entirely new like nothing we had played before everyone was learning and no one was too good at it. It was like the times when you first played video games the old FIFA’s and CODs all entirely new and you probably sucked but you didn’t care. The feeling of getting a win in these seasons was a great feeling as well. Now you have an expectation of yourself to do well and winning isn’t the same because you’ve played for such a long time you feel you should be doing well. It’s now angering when you die and do poorly. All this is to say that the developers are doing nothing wrong with how they are handling this game. There is literally nothing they can do which would bring back the way it used to be. I believe the game was by far at its greatest when all this spam building wasn’t a thing and everyone was kind of semi-terrible and there’s no way to bring that back. And obviously this is no ones fault at all it’s just the natural progression of people’s skill. It’s all very familiar now and it has lost a lot of its magic. Anyway it will probably always be one of my favourite games of all time. For a good 3-4 months it brought back an experience in gaming I had experienced for a long long time. I still very much enjoy playing this game for short stints but my friends and I hardly ever get a full squad anymore and the way we would play for just hours on end hasn’t happened in months and I doubt will ever happen again. I do hope there is a game that comes along with a similar affect as fortnite but I’m not holding my breathe for it being any time soon",FortNiteBR

My email was boring and stated the obvious:

“You completed all the challenges”

Thanks Captain Obvious I didn’t know that I completed all of them! Thanks for telling me this information!

“You played with 152 friends”

Yes I know that, I have 190 people on my friends list. You don’t have to tell me this.

This stuff I kind of knew already:

“Heavy Shotgun was your favorite legendary”

Of course, it’s one of the shotguns that are actually viable and I used it. You don’t have to tell me.

“You completed the Getaway 18 times”

I played the Getaway a lot so this was expected. You go out to tell me how many times I win the Getaway and not my total wins of Season 5?

The only interesting things aren’t even that useful:

“You placed 10,100 structures”

In fact what do they mean by structures? Mats I place down? 1x1’s I make? Please clarify to me?

“You used the Grappler 342 times”

That’s interesting but, was this necessary to track this number?

I didn’t get a stat about total kills or total wins. The only thing I was excited for this email. Instead they just gave me things that I already knew, or they were interesting but have no purpose. You don’t let us look at stats for mobile yet you track how many times I use a grappler? How many times I place a “structure”? I’m just severely disappointed in this email. ",FortNiteBR

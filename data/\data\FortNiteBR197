Having decent weapons that are more common prevents someone from winning simply because he happened to stumble on a p90, suppressed Ar, double barrel etc. IM NOT SAYING that weapons of higher rarity shouldn’t be better but I am saying that lower tier weapons should be able to compete and if you die you can say “that’s totally my fault”. I know they already lowered the rarity of the items in the title but they never increased the spawn rate. The only decent common weapons are the pump and smg which is why this is the majority of everyone’s loadout and there’s no diversity.

I have no qualms with the pellet spread or base shotgun damages and I understand that the two (2) second delay when switching between shotgun shots was added in order to prevent double pumping. however I do believe that having to wait an entire 2 sec in the middle of a fight to shoot because i have 2 shotguns and swap mid fight is absurd. My suggestion; make the swap delay the same as the fire rate of the shotgun that i am swapping to i.e. if i shoot a pump shot and swap to a tac shotgun i should not need to wait 2 seconds but only wait 0.67 second (tac shotgun fire rate) so on and so forth with the other shotgun combinations. I believe this is the right course to take in order to address the double pump problem. This would allow players to carry bothe desired weapons at the same time as a heavy shotgun is vastly different from the double barrel.

It's tough to enjoy becoming better at a game by increasing my aim or perhaps learning new ways to improve my low ground. Because frankly I can't highground anyone anymore. Either I get shot down because I can't put down enough wooden platforms fast enough. Or the enemy outbuild me because they can despite me trying to shoot it down. People outbuild my minigun with only one wallplatform between.

I took a break because I burned myself trying, and succeeding, to get the Max Omega (lvl 100 suit from season 4) and I came back now in season 6. I have enjoyed the day playing some duos and squads and tried to end the day with some solo. Many laughs were had, for the most part at least.

However in both duo and squads we came to the conclusion that ""People are simply too good nowadays"". We can't outfight the opponents, we can't win with aim. We get outbuilt, we get peaked, we get rushed as soon as we engage.

Now you might think ""get guud"" and ""just build"". I might not be an aimgod to be far. I usually rank in the ""securely above average"" rank in most games I play. My friends however are better and in CS:GO for example they are ranked Supreme and Global usually, in other words good players. 

Ending my night trying to focus on improving my shotgun headshots as well as not thinking about missed shots was becoming tedious. What happaned was I had enemies destroying walls around me instantly replacing them with their own walls that are edited with a peaking hole in them or opponents that are two levels above me in build fights. This is unfortunately making the game more tough for me to enjoy coming back to.

If I can't feel competetive enough while being above average, what is everyone else feeling dying to ""Streamer [5697]""?

Here are the titles of some of the lessons - *“Variables, Tfue, and Ninja”, “Calculate a Victory Royale”, “Storms and Conditionals”, and ""I See A Llama""*.

We hope it's cool to post here. Learning to program in 2018 is boring af and we wanted to combine something that’s actually fun (ex. video games) with the learning process so that it doesn’t feel like homework. Trust me, my little brother gave this website a 7/10.

So I sat down playing Save the World and I got to thinking about the Battle Royale challenges and how they could be better when it hit me: Fortnite has seasons, so what if, every week, instead of ""challenges"", we got episodes? These would be special objectives like ""find 8 letters in the mail in retail row"" or ""defeat bad guys in tilted towers."" I'd split all the objectives into 5 ""acts"" and completing an act gives you 10 battle stars. Completing all the acts in an episode gives you a 20-second clip of the plot of the episode, with a secret battlestar somewhere in the video. Completing 7 episodes gives you a ""Special Guest Star"" that is a legendary outfit. Completing all 10 episodes including the ""season finale"" (final episode of a season) will give you a 2 minute long cinematic, a legendary loading screen, and 50k XP as well as 40 battlestars. There could also be a mid-season finale that is an in-game event similar to the rocket launch that happens for everyone at the same time, like a fireworks display or a meteor shower. There could also be a ""next season preview"" that happens at the end of a season to generate hype for the subsequent season. What do you guys think? Comment down below your ideas and suggestions.

Season 6 will be the season that Save the World goes free to play, and this is why -

As many people have speculated, Battle Royale is a simulation, taking place in a ‘virtual reality’ of the last heroes and survivors of the Save the World world. Several events that were happening in the in the real Save the World universe transferred over to the simulation, including the meteor and all similar events – However, after the meteor struck the world, in both Battle Royale and Save the World, the visitor came who manipulated the simulations, in which he was able to escape into the ‘real’ world (Save the World world).

However, he left remnants of himself in the simulation, with the rifts. The rifts caused other simulations to collide with other simulations, as well as the real world. Both the simulations and parts of the world became corrupted and altered with each other, in which the Canny Valley area (from StW) combined with the BR world, replacing the Moisty Mire (and prison *F* ) with the Canny Valley desert.

Anarchy Acres was transformed due to a fragment of the rocket impacting there also, which combined with a fragment of another simulation (a ‘relaxation’ simulation, since you can’t go out and play golf in the storm, and the Homebases in StW are too small and don’t have good terrain for a golf courses, or suitable environments for a pool etc).

After this, the rocket flew over Greasy which converted the area to the Viking Village. The heroes have only discovered Stonewood, Plankerton, Canny Valley and Twine Peaks, however the rest of the world has yet to be cleared from the storm, but some survivors came from these areas to our Homebases – This is why the Viking Village and Tomato Temple come from, and we will visit these locations in a later year (as StW progresses and expands further).
Finally, when the rocket finally excaped, leaving the Rift in the sky over Loot Lake, this was the ‘major’ point of entry/exit – The rift shrunk and converted into the cube, which the Visitor is in control of.

The Visitor is still controlling the cube, which planted the runes last season and sent the cube into Loot Lake to have a ‘vehicle’ to move around in (which he chose mid Island of Loot Lake) and is now activating all of the runes.

Several skins have similarities with StW, with the Backbone and Chopper skin, these are outfits are from when Ramirez and Lars played during the simulation, where also on the glider it has a Plankerton logo on it. Also Cloaked Star (Ninja) joined our Homebase after we finished our quest with him and is now fighting alongside us against the storm. We also have a lot more variety in skins, they’re not all just the base Soldiers, now we have Ninjas, Constructors and also Outlanders models (and faces) being used.
The cube bridges the gap between BR and StW.

Once cube/island visits all runes (going anti-clockwise, up to dusty, then retail) and will be finishing at lazy links and will ‘convert’ the area around the lazy links area with more corruption spreading up to loot lake, plus into tomato town and lazy links, where tomato temple area is partly destroyed.

Each ‘corrupted’ zone will have assets from StW teleported into it, (on that week’s content update) where each zone is now a ‘husk’ zone including an one (or more) zones will have an encampment that will activate some time during the match, spawning Husks into the world. Once the encampment is cleared, a reward box will drop containing the usual ammo, materials etc but also one StW weapon. If 4 players cleared the encampment (a squad) each player will receive their own separate ‘reward’ client side.

These StW weapons are not the normal weapons, however items including the Zaptron will return in these crates, as well as buffed version of the original Tec-9 looking SMG and other vaulted items. These would drop as ‘mythic’ items because of their rarity.
Once the StW F2P update, many changes will happen to the BR world to bridge the difference, because they are now the ‘same’ world – where the original traps (ceiling, and wall zappers) will return much like the freeze trap.

All of the ‘new’ items are always tested in the BR first, which is why they come to the StW (item shop) at a later date.

Please let me know what you think of this, :)

PS - Epic please add an ADS Fov slider to switch between legacy and 'new' FOV so I can actually play more than 1 game before getting motion sick, I didn't spend all my money for my god-roll Nocturno to not be able to use it (because of the ads FOV change, cant ads anymore or get sick)",FortNiteBR

There has even been a situation where my friend would leave to restart his game and we never stopped hearing him... Even when he had the game closed.

Like this isn't just a minor glitch, theres some serious privacy concerns here. When you leave a party that should be it - end of broadcast. But fortnite is clearly still listening to your mic and broadcasting it (to who is anyone's guess) 

Considering most of fortnite's players are kids too... Its pretty concerning...

I finally found a fix for it... Basically Fortnite decides your anticheat on an algorithm which is stored in your registry...

To change it You need to open registry editor:

1)Goto HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Epic Games\\Unreal Engine

2)Select Identifiers

3)Rename MachineID to DUMMYID

4)Restart PC

&amp;#x200B;

This will force EPIC games launcher to remake the algorithm which will hopefully change your anticheat (Repeat step 3 and 4 if it doesnt)

Just thought to leave it here in case someone needed it :)

MY two buddies died and logged off (it was our last game of the night) and it was me and this kid (he was probably 13 years old if I had to guess).

Anyways, he revived me and gave me bandages to heal up (because I suck hahaha) and I told him thank you. He told me that was one of the nicest things anyone has ever told him on this game. That made me kinda sad. The kid even sent me a friend request.

Anyways, all I'm saying is it's fun to troll people and act like a bunch of heathens (which my friends and I definitely do) but at at the end of the day kids are still kids and we shouldn't be complete assholes when we play games like Fortnite with them. Whenever we realize it's some kid in our squad we don't act like a buncha assholes. I get it, kids can be annoying but I hope no one is purposely being dicks to them.

I hope that kid has more positive interactions with other players in the future, and that starts with people like you and me. I don't want any more toxic gaming communities (league of legends comes to mind lol).

I have played since before seasons where a thing (proof on my YT) and have a few ""OG"" items on my account and i wouldnt get salty if they bring them back, id be happy because it means more people can use them.

A good example is the red knight, i had that since it first came out in the store and it disapointed me that no one uses it nowadays, but epic brought it back again a bit ago and it made the skin a lot better seeing other people using it alongside myself.

Ill put my two cents onto why i personally think someone would get mad at epic bringing back COSMETIC ITEMS.

*(this is purely my opinion/speculation)*

a) They planned to sell their accounts (which is against TOS) and got a bunch of rare ""OG"" items but epic brings back the items and they get mad that they cant make a quick few dollars from cosmetics in a game.

b) They are that sad they have to find vaildation in a game by having ""OG"" items and get insecure when epic releases an item they already have

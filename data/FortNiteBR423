I get top 25 90+% of the time, and top 10 50+% of the time 

I can never seem to finish off, placed 2nd 3 games in a row today on duos.

What are your crucial end game tips? Try to get high ground, build, and play passively aggressively? Try to hide it out and let the people kill each other? 

Building a dope fort is super fun, but not when the circle shrinks to the others with the 4 story metal castle and you just wasted all your resources, but that's part of the luck of having the final circle shrink on you.

My 2 wins I've been in the final circle both times, just gotten lucky and had a shitton of metal, and fortified an existing structure 

Looting and killing isn't the problem for me, I average 3 kills/game. 

It's the final strategy part that fucks me up, I have choked so many possible wins it's unreal.

5,gtggtfg,1509609109,7aa288,148,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7aa288/idea_bush_trap/,273,(Idea) Bush trap,"Yellow or purple grade trap that looks just like a bush. It would activate in melee range so you could not check if its a trap with a pickaxe. You would have to shoot it to check if it's a trap but that is also risky because it can give away your position. Placeable anywhere except buildings


*EDIT* 
u/Pelagiad brought up a great point in the comments, so here is an alternative version to the trap

Bush trap 2.0
- Cannot be destroyed kinda like normal bushes

- Only the player who put it down can destroy it

- Activates when enemy has been sitting in it for 8 seconds (this will encourage people not to sit still in bushes because fear of it being a trap)

- Bigger hitbox because people can also go behind the bush

- To reset the trap activation time players would have to move about one or two meters away from the bush idk

-Also maybe now blue grade trap because it wouldn't be so powerful",FortNiteBR

8,polimetrix,1509603225,7a9pi6,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7a9pi6/serious_discussion_about_armor/,3,Serious discussion about Armor,"First off, I would like to say that I'm a big fan of the Battle Royal game genre. I have played H1Z1 since release, then switched to PUBG and played that for a good period of time. Out of H1Z1, PUBG, and Fortnite, I like Fortnite the best. I think Fortnite has the fastest gameplay of all 3 and requires mechanics to outplay your opponents. With that being said, I feel like armor, is overpowered. 

I believe that armor has a bigger impact in fights than any other item in the game, including gold weapons. Gold weapons are supposed to be the extremely rare, top performing guns that you mostly will only get from an air drop. Why does armor have more of an impact than that? You can outshoot somebody who has a gold weapon with a grey equivalent. Fighting someone who has full HP and Armor is a different story. It is very frustrating to get into a gun fight with somebody, landing 5-6 shots, and then have them kill me because armor made them a tank. I have done plays that I have should not have gotten away with, not because I outaimed or outplayed my opponent, but because I was tanky enough to compensate for my mistakes.

I think the imbalance comes from a few things. First off, if you kill somebody who has a gold weapon, you get now take their gold weapon. High risk, high reward. Killing someone with armor nets you nothing. 

Secondly, lets look at the numbers. The grey assault rifle deals 32 damage per shot. The gold scar deals 39. That's a 7 hp difference per shot. Armor is a blue item that gives a 50hp advantage. You would have to land 7 shots from the gold scar in comparison to the grey AR for the HP advantage to be equal to 1 armor potion. You can have 2 armor potions. 

Thirdly, there's really no way to tell if someone even has armor until you shoot them. That grants it's own advantage in itself.

What do you guys think? Is armor balanced? Does armor need to be tweaked?",FortNiteBR

However, I think how overpowered shotguns are isn't getting enough attention. Of the last 10 games I've played, I've probably been killed by a shotgun in at least 8 or 9 of them. Shotguns completely negate the purpose of smgs, handguns, and rifles at almost all ranges. Completely limiting a diverse range of weapons and tactics. Everything comes down to explosives and shotguns.     
    
Why rely on weapon bloom when I can hit for 60+ damage on a guy 30 metres away reliably? Why carry this handgun/revolver/smg when a shotgun is better suited for their roles in every way? The shotgun is rightfully devastating at close range, but should not be the ideal weapon for almost all situations. I think damage drop needs to be amped considerably; because there is currently no reason to even carry 4 of the guns available to us.

It's possible that consuming slurp juice while running was a touch too strong. 

I present a couple ideas:

1) Make slurp juice consumable while at walk speed and NOT while running.

2) Consuming slurp juice while standing still consumes it at it's original drink speed (2 seconds), but while on the move the drink speed is 4-5 seconds.

I really love the idea of a consuming a heal while on the move. It's very unique and would bring another element of usefulness to it. Instead of just drinking it right away when you find it you may just think twice, knowing it could save you if you got stuck in a storm.",FortNiteBR

Keep rewards up to level 25.




Add weapon challenges. Not too sure about you guys but during prime Mw2 time, I loved to grind the weapon challenges to get camo's, titles and emblems. I don't see games doing these challenges anymore and its sad.


- - -


**Kills with the AR:**


50 = XP


150 = XP


300 = XP + Banner


500 = XP + Weapon Skin




**Headshot Kills with AR:**


25 = XP


50 = XP


100 = XP + Banner


150 (or 200) = XP + Weapon Skin



**Sniper examples:**



- Sniper Kills.


- Sniper Headshots OR Sniper fatal shots.




**RPG examples:**



- RPG Kills.


- RPG Direct Impact kills.




Every weapon could have these challenges!



**Levels:**


As theres no rewards for levels after 25, you may think ""Whats the point for XP rewards?""
Epic could add banner rewards for bigger levels. Level 50 banner, 100 banner, 150 banner ETC. Preharps could reward different banner shapes and new colours for higher levels as well! - EDIT - ..... animated banners. Imagine :O


- - -


This game is free to play and in no way do I need more or free rewards from the Devs. This is just an idea which would actually be insane imo. It would also keep the game active as no one wants to slow down playing mid grind.


The kill amounts are just examples. Not sure if they are too high or too low. Don't let them put you off the idea.


Weapon Skins are just an idea. I completely understand if they are not wanted as rewards as the game is free. I think that if they are hard to get, players would still buy any future weapon skins.



Banners: Probably planned but show them next to player name when someone is spectating you and make sure people see the person who killed them banner so it has a point.

So heres a basic as fuck guide on how to shoot. I guarantee that if all these complainers analyzed their clips, they will find something wrong with what they are doing. Before the garbage complainers start complaining once again like they always do, I invite them to also post a link to the clip. 

#1) Make sure center of crosshair is on the target. Not the  4 lines. Has to be dot. 

#2) Stop moving while shooting. Crouch. Move left and right to avoid getting hit. Dont shoot while moving. Take shots the split moment you stop to go the other direction. 

#3) Don't use auto. Just don't. Auto has actual RNG and is unreliable in most games. Not just fortnite. Tap. Tapping will allow for most of you shots to connect if you do the previous procedures correctly. If  someones close enough to auto reliably, he's also close enough to get a one pump to the face. There is nothing wrong with how auto works. It was never meant to be reliable as long distance. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite 1.8 Unfortunately doesn't compact as well as 1.7, which went from 16GB to ~3GB, but it still [shaves off a respectable 8GB.](https://i.imgur.com/JPYB7Z4.png) making it 44% smaller. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR - 5s longer load time, no in-game performance loss, 8GB disk space saved.**

&amp;nbsp;

Tests were conducted with an i7-6700HQ, GTX 970M and Fortnite installed on a HGST 7200RPM HDD. 



 | Uncompressed| Compressed
---|---|----
**Load Time (Desktop &gt; Menu)** | 47.14s| 51.38s
**Load Time (Menu &gt; Game)** | 8.56s| 10.21s
**Average FPS**| 80.9| 79.7
**1% Low FPS**| 49.75| 44.7

**Graphs of performance data were  [compiled into a chart here](https://i.imgur.com/zocOXxg.png)**

* The FPS values were calculated by loading into BR mode for 5 minutes and dropping right into the middle, then running around as much as possible. 

* The load time graphs have 10 seconds of idle before ""Launch Game"" was clicked so that background activity could be noted. The first spike at ~10s is when the launch button was clicked.

Currently i  often loot the edges of busy areas then try to kill the guys leaving as they often have collected good loot for me. 
I'm just not sure if supply drops drop often enough, when exactly they start dropping, and if they drop often enough come mid-game to know if it's a viable strategy? Any knowledge or an article detailing supply drops would be nice.
I have been doing it so far with some success, it helps me catch up if i get in the top 20 and i havent killed anyone with great loot or found any myself.

So, A) there was no reward for being at the top of the leaderboard in any game type. I managed to learn the game and ""git gud"" and was #1 for every category in Duo and Squad, #2 in Solo. But alas, it seems to have been in vain, because there was no increase in XP, and no reward of any other sort. 

And, B) this is the really weird part: my (and others, it seems) stats have *carried over* from last week into the current weekly leaderboard. Meaning, you are now in a new group of 50 random people, but your stats have carried over. 

Ex: If you managed to pull 5 wins in Duo's last week, you will start this week off with 5 wins. 

So why is that an issue? Well, that kind of defeats the purpose of a weekly leaderboard, doesn't it? So while I was #1 across the board for Duo and Squad, it's now a mixed bag between #1 and #2. While I'm not personally upset about no longer being #1, it's easy to see how people will be disappointed with the current system. Now, it's a very real possibility to be matched with someone in the future who will have 20+ more wins than you, making it nearly impossible to get that #1 spot. And that's definitely going to be a bummer for some people. 

Of course I'm just speaking for myself, so please let me know if I'm off base here, but I think weekly leaderboards should be just that – *weekly* leaderboards.

Everyone should reset to all 0's, and there should be an actual reward of some sort after each week, even if it's just something small like 1,000 XP for wins, 750 XP for the next category, and 500 XP for the last one. 

If this is how they intended the weekly leaderboards to operate, frankly I'm a bit confused. But I understand it's a free game, and they've got a lot on their plates. Hopefully they'll address this eventually though, for I was initially excited to reach that #1 spot, and would continue to enjoy that grind, so long as it's actually meaningful! I don't quite care about beating 49 random people if there's nothing to gain besides bragging rights.

Some people like myself enjoy playing battle royale and would like to be able to buy some customisations without having to spend real money on it, we should be awarded V-bucks depending on how we do, this could be from winning to getting kills or how long we survive, or another option can be challenges that give you V-bucks this is to encourage alot of players to give it their best and make the game alot better

We shouldn't have to play PvE to get V-bucks to spend on battle royale, any sort of change that allows players to earn while playing battle royale will make all players feel better, atm the customisation feature just feels pointless to 90% of the players because of how it works, you can hardly find people with customisation, if everyone was able to make change the appearance of their character then it would make their character feel more unique to the player.

Infinite inventory slots. I'm sick of having to drop stuff and other people being able to get it. It's a cartoonish game, infinite inventory will only help. 

Less sensitivity on sniper rifles. As it stands they are OP as fuck, making them like they used to be defaulted to would balance the game a lot IMO. 

Digging. Again, whole new layer (literally) to gameplay. Imagine a huge open map with structures below and above ground. 

All rifles are burst. Fully auto rifles are another OP weapon in the game tbh, all burst would balance the game a lot.

The ultimate balancing strategy would be to remove the tiers and make every weapon uniform, maybe some attachments that you can pick up.

Icons for every player on the map once it gets down to 30 or so players. This would help intensify the late game stage.

3. Outdoor Trap.  Let us literally trap enemies so they're forced to stand still for 5, 10, 15 seconds etc...

4. Remote Mines.  Who doesn't love pressing a button and watching an unsuspecting somebody blow up.

5. Poison Grenade.  This might be too OP depending on balance but a noxious grenade that slowly kills people in it?  Or some kind of weapon that will kill you slowly until you bandage up.

*Obvious Improvements*

* New map locations. The haunted mansion/castle fit in here. The mine someone proposed also looked like a nice change of pace vs the mountains that we currently have.

* Grenade types? Personally, I would like to see the addition of smoke grenades for distractions/ portable cover (Cap the limit at 3 so that the server doesn't melt. Alongside molotov cocktails or some sorta poison/ Area of Denial. Well built forts can be constructed to defend against these but an abundance of windows/ no roofs should have some sorta drawback.

* Cap resource/ammo carrying limit (in Squads/Duos)? Can add in backpacks that allow players to carry more of both. This gives squads an extra layer of depth as you must protect your resource/ammo donkey in case you run dry in the middle of a firefight.

* The ability to reinforce walls. 10 resources to build, 20 resources to upgrade to Lvl 2 and 30 for Lvl 3. While in the PvE part of the game I hope that it makes the jump to PvP as well. Lvl 3 reinforced steel or brick walls would be able to tank one RPG shot giving you time to react instead of an immediate, oh fuck moment.

I understand a lot of these have been pitched in some way or another but the 12/12 announcement just got me thinking that Bluehole is giving Epic WAY too much time to get ready.

118,derickso,1509481407,79ykhi,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/79ykhi/west_coast_latency_discrepancy/,7,West Coast Latency Discrepancy,"According to [Epic's Performance Update](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fnbr-performance-update?lang=en-US) the only US servers running the game are in AWS in Ohio and Virginia.  Epic recommends using [Cloudping](http://www.cloudping.info/) to get a rough sense of latency to these locations.  Here is an example FROM California, to the current server locations:

&gt; US-East (Virginia)	83 ms

&gt; US East (Ohio)	90 ms

And for comparison purposes, here is an example FROM California to OTHER AWS locations NOT currently being used by Epic:

&gt; US-West (California)	19 ms

&gt; US-West (Oregon)	39 ms

So as is, if you live in the western United States, you are probably playing with 40-60ms more latency than anyone in the eastern United States, likely because Epic is trying to save a few bucks on the marginally cheaper compute in AWS' east coast data centers.  Putting my tin foil hat on, I think that is also why you can't get an in-game ping/latency report as well.

I'm aware that Epic have a lot of other stuff to focus on, which is why **I don't think achievements should be a prioritization** in any way. I'm creating this so when the day comes, we might have something to look back at - like a *favorite & forget* type of deal.

If achievements should give a reward, it should be like 50-100 xp.

I also want to say that I'm NOT ungrateful for all the new stuff Epic has given us just because I want to share my thoughts. This is not intended to be backseat developing (though I understand the line between backseat developing and suggestions is slim), but rather a thread to get the creative part of your brain going. 

Do you have any suggestions for achievements? I will update this list as ideas come up.

 

**EDIT**: extended the list. 

Thanks to /u/Shroed, /u/Peekabluu and /u/Luckmod for suggestions.

There are so many videos of these asshats on youtube being proud of having these hacks and sharing them publicly and giving links to the hacks themselves. Theres even a positive like ratio on all of them. I'm dropping links to these videos below and hopefully Epic can see the source of these hacks and find better ways to weave these cheaters out from this great game they shared free to the public. When i searched this in google i really hoped i would find one or two videos and mostly links to people being upset about these cheaters but almost every link was to another Youtube video showing you how to download and another guy showing his game play with wallhacks and aimbot, most recently i even saw a teleporting bullet hack??? Funniest part is the guy died 2 minutes in showing even with hacks he can't win a game. Hopefully more is done and we get some sweet, sweet banhammers slamming these guys down. Alright rants over guys, time to play me some Fortnite and if i get no scope sniped from across the map...It's gonna feel real bad.

There's honestly so many more but I'm not going to put more effort into this, None of those guys deserve my time. Let me know what you think and hopefully Epic is developing more and more ways to stop these guys, Have a good one all.

You're playing solos, and moving across some open ground towards the circle. Someone - let's say the blonde-haired dude - suddenly appears on a hill behind you, and starts taking potshots. You spin around, get a few better shots in and force him to retreat, back behind the hill. You decide not to pursue but make a mental note of their last known position.

A minute later, you spot another blonde-haired dude - that looks exactly like the first - in some trees, a short distance away from the hill. Now here's the million dollar question: *Is that the same guy?*

With only eight (I think?) base skins in the game right now, and almost no one sporting the few cosmetic skins yet (for various reasons), the fact is that *you don't really know if those two encounters are the same person, or two people with identical skins.* I've seen suggestions floating around that we get more nuanced customization: shirts, pants, maybe hats, etc. Have some things that are unlockable through playing, and some (crazier) things that can only be bought. This way, even if two people are using the same basic skin, it's extremely unlikely that they wouldn't have at least some differences in their outfit.

**TL;DR:** If everyone looks unique, it's much easier to strategize in-game because you have a much clearer picture of how many nearby threats there are. Right now you're often just guessing because so many people look the same. Hopefully we get a true customization system at some point, because it's good for gameplay if even F2P players look different from each other.",FortNiteBR

I've seen people go for long range first though in most cases I like shotguns first. You have less time to react in a close encounter with shotguns than you do with a medium range. Generally you will have time to switch to a medium if needed but if someone gets the first shot off with a shotgun it could be half your health gone.  And ofc I put heals in the last slot and explosives normally in the second last slot.

I think the shotgun is generally fine where it does heavy damage close up and minimal damage far away.

Except at about medium range (15m - 25m) getting a headshot with a shotgun does about 60 DMG. while body shot do between 10-15.

They really don't get thanked enough on this subreddit.,"Golly gee. We need more posts on this subreddit thanking Epic for the generous and charitable work they do. Can you believe they gave us this game for free? I bet they don't even want our money. I bet Epic is struggling to put food on the table with this one, but they just want to give us the best experience out of the goodness of their hearts.

$20 for a skeleton skin and scythe? That's so gosh darn cheap! We are so lucky that Epic allows us the privilege of giving them money. These skins should be $50 each at least! If you think $50 for a skin in this totally free game is too expensive you need to **check your entitlements**.

Can you believe there are people out there that actually have **the audacity** to want to be able to choose one of the 7 basic character models already in the game? The nerve of these people! This is a f2p charity game! If you want a say in your basic gender/race/hair color then you can buy one of the $12 skins! If you think you should be able to choose a basic character model like nearly every other f2p game, you need to **check your entitlements.**

And that infinite shotgun range glitch? It only took them like 30 hours to fix that game-breaking glitch! Some people thought it took them too long to notice something so obvious and game-breaking, but I say they're only human and if you have an opinion that disagrees with me you need **to check your entitlements.**

Did I mention this game is in early access? Let me explain early access to you. Early access means any faults or flaws in the game absolutely cannot be pointed out or critiqued. The fact that the game is monetized changes nothing. Early Access is the ultimate shield, and if you dare to suggest otherwise then you need to **check your entitlements.**

You spent $60 on very reasonably priced vbucks and you dare to get annoyed when squad playlists are disabled or you get frequent disconnections and stability issues? Listen here bud, your $60 was **a donation** to support this very charitable cause. This is a free game and it's in early access! What part of complete immunity from all criticism do you not understand? You should be kissing Epic's feet for even bothering to keep the servers up on weekends! This is the weekend! People don't work on weekends!

Don't even get me started on people who think Epic should explain how XP works, how divisions work, or how to get your sensitivity back to normal. These people are scum, and our Lord and Savior Epic will give us the answers when they deem us worthy. 

Positivity only here on the FortniteBR subreddit. If you have something to give that's not praise you need to **check. your. entitlements.**",FortNiteBR

Reflect on these posts though, and appreciate what Epic has done for the game, and continues to do for the community. It’s great to have this amount of communication with a developer, it empowers us as consumers. I for sure will be throwing money at them to support the game, and those who aren’t able to afford it. 

The game is still in Closed Beta state and there’s so much room for improvement (look at server issues this weekend as a great example) I can’t wait to see what Fortnite BR will look like I’m the next year.

i have around 56 hours so far and today i was playing a duo game, my teammate died and i go for the refrags, i knock 1 guy, i have a white m4 and i 3 hit the other guy so he is at 4 hp he gets behind cover, i have full health and i obviously had to push them ( they're behind a big tree and i dont have enough bullets to spam it down or have anything with high enough damage to burst it down ) so i just have to guess 1 angle and hope he peaks straight into my crosshair, but it's 3rd person so he can see me and i cant see him and as soon as i'm like 1 meter away from the tree he peaks out on the other side of the tree and 1shots me with a shotgun, 







3rd person is such a joke in huge open multiplayer games like this, look at pubg for example the 3rd person mode is a joke, standing near a corner and being able to see people from miles away







yes i'm aware ""duh you can get cheap kills aswell"" everytime i destroy someone in a ""duel"" if you can even call it that due to the fact i'm abusing 3rd person it feels awful and not satisfying at all, i do feel sorry for the poor dude because theres literally nothing he can do in like 99.9% of the cases,

Granted, I play it on the PS4, which is 100% more cumbersome to be good at than PC players (if we could build half as good/fast as you guys, it'd be a different game entirely), but these are my top 5 personal places to land.  

If you'd rather just see the spots in very detailed and elaborate action, [a source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNLxrdiMJNQ) is at the bottom of this post.

  - #5:  The underpass:  
This area is located directly to the south of Tomato town.  It's to the right of loot lake and northeast from the dusty depot.  When you're in the underpass, there are three weapon spawns.  Most of the time, these aren't very awe-inspiring.  What you're after; however, is the secret room.  There's a yellow car parked here -- directly in front of it is a secret wall.  When you break it, the area inside can spawn up to 2 treasure chests right next to each other.  There's also a green ammo tin.  

  - #4:  The Tree Of Might:
In the bottom right hand section of the map is the often ignored Moisty Mire.  At the north tip of this area is a cluster of four trees.  The ""tree of might"" is the largest of the four.  It can spawn up to three chests at once, which should put you miles ahead of the competition.

  - #3:  The Barn Roof:
This is directly to the east of Retail Row.  There's a cluster of small buildings surrounded by a large centerpiece, which is the barn you're looking for.  This barn can spawn 2 treasure chests and is, in my opinion, one of the most consistent areas that does so.  I'd say 9 out of 10 times this barn has the 2 chests.  The issue is, the barn itself is inaccessible.  So you either need to land directly on it (ideal) or build a ramp up to it.  

  - #2:  The Northeast Tower
Directly to the northesat of the Wailing Woods there are two larger hills.  If you look at the round shaped one, directly north of it is a brown structure.  This is the tower.  This seemingly playerbuilt structure can spawn up to 3 chests.  One at the tip of the tower, one on an outside ledge, and one on the 2nd floor in a wooden doorway.  It's the surrounding area that makes this place more than ideal.  Directly northwest from the tower is an ice cream van parked on a ledge.  This can spawn 2 chests, one below it and one directly on top of it.  To the northeast of this van is a shack with a coach on its roof.  The basement can spawn a chest here as well.  There's a more detailed path to multiple more treasure chests in my video, as well.

  - #1:  Greasy Grove ""Bottle"" Building
Normally I would never recommend dropping into such a heavily populated area such as Greasy Grove if you intend to win (unless you're incredible at the game, that is).  However, this area is loot filled to the extreme.  There are 3 main buildings in Greasy Grove:  A large orange one, a smaller green one and a medium sized gray one.  It's the medium sized one you want to land on.  It's shaped like a bottle, almost, and the ""plug"" of the bottle is where you want to land on the roof.  Breaking through this ""plug"" will often drop you directly on top of a chest in a four walled room.  Break the the north wall and you'll go directly into the building -- stay on the second floor and jump over a counter top that says ""GUNS"" and there will be 1, 2 or even 3 treasure chests.  If there are no chests, there's often a blue, purple or orange item.  This area is also a great spawn for potions as well as full med kits.


Reading these locations without visuals isn't exactly ideal, but again, if you want to check out the video, feel free.  I zoomed in on the map for each location as well as gave elaborate walkthroughs of how to proceed.  Enjoy!

“Hey dude, you gotta mic?”

“MICROPHONE!” In a thick French accent.

I wince

“Yeah... microphone.”

“UH HUH, *unintelligible*”

I try to ask where he wants to go but he cuts me off.

“AMERICA?”

I pause and reply “Yeah, I’m American”

He laughs hard. I’m being laughed at for being American by a small French boy on fortnite.

“Alright man, where are we going”

“YOU JUMP OKAY?”

I decide to lead him to the 3 story house on the edge of the map.
I’m almost to the house when I pull my umbrella and look back at him. 

He’s not there.

I open the map and it looks like he went straight down.

“Alright I’ll loot this and mee-“

“I AM DEAD FUCK YOU FUCK BLACK *probably something in French* AHHHHHHHHHHHH I DIE!”

Shooting at a reasonable distance is completely out of the picture because you'll waste 30 bullets for maybe 1 hit and this gives your opponent all the time to adjust.

Thus, being caught in the open is actually an advantage because while you're basically untouchable, you have a good overview of most positions. I do it because it's the best strategy, but it annoys me that it works.

Sniping is hard enough, and it should be a one shot kill no matter the hp (since everyone is 200hp 24/7 anyway). Instead, you hit a sick long distance shot and by the time you get closer to finish him he's already back to 200hp with the positional advantage.

Anyway, a decent shooter shouldn't be about RNG but about skill. Currently, skill is completely overwhelmed by luck. Now, why did Epic design their game like this in the first place? It boggles my mind. But I fear by the time they realize how stupid this is, 80% of their players will have left for a more rewarding game.",FortNiteBR

I don't run into it at all in squads but in solo it rewards players for looking at the ground. yes you can auto aim on them but in the last circles you will often be in gun fights and not have time to check. Then you get shot gunned in the back of the head while building to fend off a sniper. Just seems like bad gameplay. Want to know the reason for keeping it in the game.

Some time ago I read a post about you guys wanting a headshot sound for fortnite. And some have posted the H1Z1 sound, others had some other ideas and so on. But one guy stated something like ""the FortNite headshot sound has to be kind of cartoony"". So I started thinking about the perfect sound fitting the style of FortNite.  

Since I'm more of a PvE player I've access to more sounds than you guys have (husks, RaY, stuff like that, etc.) and after playing a few missions I heard the - in my opinion - perfect sound for it.  

[I'm talking about those badboys](http://www.shillianth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Fortnite-Monster-beehive2.png)

Alright, as this image doesn't tell you anything, here's the deal: Those husks have their head covered with a beehive, which you have to break to actually land a headshot on them. While shooting at the hive, it will break and makes a sound [which sounds something like this](https://streamable.com/9bk17). I guess that's kind of the perfect sound for you guys to notice that you landed a headshot. It sounds like crushing the skull of your enemy while staying cartoony enough so it can fit the style of FortNite.  


Let me hear what you think about it and/or your opinion!

Run through the Tutorial until your on to playing story mode, you should have the Collection Book by then, Provided you have the spare schematics you can level up your book to Level 6 which will reward you with 500 vB, if you did the Tutorial Quests and leveled up the Collection Book you should have 700 vB by now, do 2 or 3 daily and you should have 800 vB enough for the cheaper items in shop or to save yourself money on vB packs.

Hope this help, it should take approximately 2 hours and hell you may even end up enjoying the PvE like I did.

We're aware (as are EPIC) that at the moment there are quite excessive queue times for Fortnite (both modes).

League of Legends the most popular game in the world right now, has a subreddit that the devs reply to. After every patch they create a stickied threat asking to report a bug. This is what the format is

Format when reporting a Bug: When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as you can about your computer.

• Server: The server you encountered the bug (NA, EUW, EUNE, TR, RU, BR, LAS, LAN etc)

• Type of Bug: Client Bug, In Game Bug etc

• Description: Describe what was the bug that occoured.

• Video / Screenshot: Insert screenshot (F12 in game) or Video of the bug occouring.

• Steps to reproduce: Provide the steps necessary if someone else had to reproduce the bug.

• Expected result: What should have been the result when you follow the steps mentioned above.

• Observed result: What was the result you obtained when you followed the steps mentioned above.

• Reproduction rate: If you try to recreate the bug how successful are you in causing it to occur? (1/10 : Occurs once every 10 tries, 5/10 : Occurs 5 times out of 10, 10/10 : Happens every single time)

And on top of that you have so many people advocating for 20 stack medium ammo again, even though it was way overkill before. 

If they implement bloom changes, and increase medium ammo to that degree, literally every other gun becomes useless. Why ever use the pistol? Why the sniper? Even shotguns become useless when an ar can down you just as fast, and not consume any precious ammo that you might need for medium distance engagements. 

With 20 medium pick ups, and laser beam ARs, this game will turn into a general game with no nuance in the gun play. No team work in squads and duos.

Having to push down R3 to crouch is atrocious when in the middle of fighting multiple enemies. R3 is our aiming analog stick, having to push it down to crouch too, completely messes you up when you're having to be on alert during a gunfight. 

Is it not possible for us to just have the freedom to shift and customise our controls to our pleasure? ",FortNiteBR

426,3sh,1509187622,799hp7,104,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/799hp7/dear_epic_heres_my_take_on_the_patch/,115,"Dear Epic, here's my take on the patch.","#Dear Epic,
you’re doing a great job on these patches and hotfixes. Not only are they quick to come, they are also comprehensive and interesting. I’m very glad I’m finally able to rock a skin into the battle arena :-)

One downside of quickly introduced patches is that things are not always fine-tuned. I know you’re aware of this, and I know you intend for us to give feedback on the patches so we can help you develop it, so here’s just that. My list of things to change, tweak, and introduce.

*(Some of these have already been posted in this sub, and some I haven’t seen yet.)*

&amp;nbsp;

*****

&amp;nbsp; 

**Auto-pickup**. I really dig this feature, however, I wish the “vacuum area” was a little bigger. I don’t feel like you should have to make 4 trips back and forth over a dead body to be able to loot it fully. It also feels a bit slow, but I’m sure this is something you already know and will look into. For all I know, it might as well just be latency issues on my end.

*TLDR: bigger vacuum area. Also a bit slow.*

&amp;nbsp;

**Recolor Slurp Juice**. In my opinion it looks very off. The hue/saturation is just too much in comparison to the rest of the items in the game.

&amp;nbsp;

**River should mean trouble**. Punish players more for crossing a river. This draws people towards the bridges - one of the most interesting battle areas. In my game experience, the bridges have been completely dead, so punishing people for crossing rivers would maybe give bridges some activity again. This punishment could i.e be a bigger river &amp; slower movement in water. You could also add a slight drift in the direction of the river.

*TLDR: make bridges great again. Deeper rivers and river flow*

&amp;nbsp;

**Mute voice chat**. This is a very simple tweak; give us the ability to mute a single person on the ingame voice chat. I often find a squad where one has a terrible and unbearable microphone, which forces me to completely shut voice chat off so the rest of the team has to suffer from lack of comms.

*TLDR: mute a single person on voice chat*

&amp;nbsp;

**Global leaderboards**. I am aware you [already have made a statement](https://imgur.com/gallery/puYcLhl) about introducing a global leaderboards, and since you said you were unsure, I feel it’s our duty to help you make up your minds. This would be a really cool feature, and would eliminate the need for us to use potentially shady 3rd party applications. I am curious as to where I average on a global basis, not necessarily between 50 seemingly random selected players (more on this in the next point).

*TLDR: global leaderboards means no shady 3rd party apps*

&amp;nbsp;

**Leaderboards**. I’m really glad you introduced some form of leaderboards, thought it may was not what most of us where expecting. I think it’s an interesting concept, but you’ve probably seen a lot of people saying their group of players is completely dead. What if, taking inspiration from League of Legends, you had to play 5 placement matches and then you’re placed in a division based on your performance during those matches (KD ratio, KPM, average placement). It would at least ensure some form of equal competition.

*TLDR: 5 placement matches before being placed in a leaderboards division*

&amp;nbsp;

**Medium Bullets**. This was a hot topic some days ago but it seems most people forgot about it. 10 Medium Bullets per stack is not enough for squads, and when I’m playing, I very often find myself completely dry of bullets. I’d give solo stacks of 10 (1/3 of mag) duos 15 (1/2 of mag), and squads 20 (2/3 of mag). If you feel like there are too many/too little bullets, please reduce their rarity, and not stack size.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mineshaft POI**. Somewhere around a hilly area on the map it would be sweet to introduce a mineshaft system. 2-3 entrances to make it balanced and harder to camp. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Dock POI**. The edges of the map suffer from being very barren; so why not create something similar to a dock? It could consist of a single main ship with some piers around. I think it could turn out fantastic.

&amp;nbsp;

**Simplify the UI**. Make it cleaner, easier to understand, easier to use. /u/Xilixir has made a really [cool post of his take on an improved UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7935at/fortnite_inventoryui_redesign).

&amp;nbsp;

**Match history**. I think a nice addition to the game would be a way to see some of your recent games (5-10). It could state how long the match lasted, how many kills you got, and what your loadout looked like when the game ended for you (*died, won, or left*).

&amp;nbsp;

**Aiming, RNG, sensitivity, yadda yadda**. I'm not gonna go into detail on this because it's been discussed 'a couple' of times here already, but you know the problem.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like if you can't afford them, or want to own them all and are upset it would cost a good amount of money, should realize they have a personal problem that's not the devs fault. The price point is in line with LoL, and my main feedback is I'd love to see changes similar to LoL with skins, epic skins having different animations, dances, bandages, grenades etc.

I feel like the amount of fun I've had, and will continue to have, outweighs at least the last 5 $60 games I've purchased. I plan to buy pve, for fun, and have already purchased cosmetics because I wholeheartedly support the devs.

They work VERY hard, while dealing with a BITCHY community, and are constantly taking feedback, communicating, and implement fixes. I am so grateful this game came out early, so I can play a game I love! Yes there are issues, but I'm happy I can get to see and be a part of the progression! This game will only get better, and I can't wait to see how great it turns out!

To clarify, I love the constructive feedback and the many great ideas coming out of the community! I do however hate that some people with feedback see fit to complain knowing full well the game is heavily in development. If there's another post outlining your issue, upvote it, comment, don't make another post acting like a little bitch who needs their EARLY ACCESS FREE GAME fixed Now, because you feel it needs change.

Tldr - I love this game, I love the devs engagement, I love the community. I hate the toxic posts, and prefer the constructively written posts. The devs often respond, and quite prompt for a team that is constantly working, taking feedback, and possibly changing their own plans to appease their player base. 

Tldr for Tldr - This game is fucking great, and beyond my expectations for an EA game! Fuck the haters!

(since you are limited from inventory slots you really dont get to hoard stuff in this game which is good, if that was consistant like not being able to use your shield reserves as an entire inventory slot)

Having awps just ubiquitous in the end game which EASILY do over 75 damage which is a one shot if you didnt medkit to past 75 health and aren't shielded is stupid. the fact theres no RNG to shooting them is overpowered for their damage and honestly snipers arent that hard to shoot so you really cant use that as an argument. snipers should really be based around getting headshots or getting multiple body shots not around just hurr durr look at me one shotting you from great distance in the body. also I think the spawn rate of slurp juice should be at least doubled. Snipers are really the only long distance gun because how they and the rocket launcher (rare as fuck) are the only non rng based guns. so snipers most certainly should not have the power they have

its really stupid that the only way to ""reserve"" shields is to be lucky enough to find 2+ shields and hoard them, or just avoid fighting entirely so you dont break your shield. its really hard to defend yourself against snipers when you cant just boost yourself up endgame so the best defense is just not to fight so you still have your shield, or just keep your distance and use snipers yourself so your shield doesn't break.",FortNiteBR

She peaks again and you start shooting. Suddenly she’s got full shield again so you knock it off. She peaks another time and bam full health again. You rush in with a shotgun and another cute redhead pops out with full shield and full health to two tap you in the head.

My point being is the randomisation of the character model allows us to distinguish between players in an enemy squad. It would become a super annoying strat if everybody just chose the same model because I think it’s tactical if you can recognise which enemy is which and play them accordingly.

The only solution I can think of is have it so the players cannot chose the same character within a squad.",FortNiteBR

If I play glass cannon AP I have to have Zonyas first. I put a lot of thought into my item placement.


2. All the times I have died pressing the wrong fucking button, this tilts me the most. Let me show you an example.

But it's all going to be okay.,"There are a lot of people on this sub that deny any of this is actually a problem.  You don't have this many people confused and upset about aiming / sensitivity unless there is an actual problem.  Yes, there is something inherently wrong right now with aim assist / RNG / and sensitivity.    A user shouldn't need to hop on a board and ask how the sensitivity works, or why their bullets aren't hitting people they are clearly aiming at.  This is evidence of a flaw in the game.

However, to the people who seem to be panicking over this, just relax.  The game is in SUCH an early state, that you need to just be patient.  We are effectively beta testing this right now, and things will get ironed out.  We are the games UAT.

TLDR; Yes it's broke.  No, they aren't killing the game with their updates.  Voice your concerns / complaints, but chill the F out and don't panic.",FortNiteBR

Anyone else?,"Could literally play for 4-5 hours without these issues before the latest patch. I play on a ps4 pro and the 50-60 fps felt so much better/smooth. I also notice I lose a lot more close combat situations because you really notice the difference between 30 and 60 fps when you’re making quick turns etc. 

I’ve had this before with games that run on low (~30) fps, i think it’s due to the “stuttering” when you’re making fast movements while playing. 

Anyways I’d love to know if there are more console players experiencing this after the update. 

I’d love to go back to the 50-60 fps, it played and felt sooo much better. I guess the good thing about this (for my social life) is that I won’t be gaming for hours anymore.

In their latest Dev update, at 1:21, Eric from Epic Games is asked ""Will you make leaderboards GLOBAL at some point?"" (I didn't even know this was ever a ""Will you"" question. It was assumed to be a ""when"" question).

His response is:

""The short answer is we're not sure. Leaderboards are something that we really wanted to get out right away. Stats are a huge opportunity for us and we're really excited about the potential.""

...........What? What on Earth could possibly be the reasoning for NOT making global, all-time leaderboards? It's one of, if not the, most important parts of a game like this. The fact that Epic was in a hurry to rush out leaderboards means they have to be aware on some level the importance of them...

The current ""leaderboards"" are a joke. They reset each week and they only show a tiny group of players. This is the worst news yet for this game.",FortNiteBR

1. **There is no point to banners currently. You cannot see them in-game. Your friends cannot see them in lobbies.**

Fix: Make it so your banner appears next to your name when you kill someone and win when you win the game. Also allow players on leaderboards to click on your name to view your banner

2. **Explain: XP system.**How does it work? How much XP do you get per match and how is it affected by placement and kills?

3. **Lack of global leaderboards/stats.**

The current leaderboards are pretty pathetic. Not only can you only see a tiny portion of people, but it's only by week. We need a global leaderboard that never resets and shows all wins of all players from all-time.

4. **No point to levels post 49.**

The only rewards are at level 10 and 25. However, your banner flair (which is currently pointless) keeps upgrading until level 49. After that...nothing. 50-100 literally does nothing.

5. **Explain/fix: What is the reward for winning your division? Is there any? If not, this should be fixed.**

6. **Explain/fix: How do players adjust their sensitivity to put it back the way it was before the patch?** Many of us have been unable to recreate the old sensitivity even after hours of adjustment.

7. **Ability to choose the basic character model.**

This is something that has been widely asked for since day 1, and it makes no sense that it didn't come with this patch. Clearly, this is possible since we can already guarantee a character by choosing a purchased skin.  We should be able to choose one of the basic character models without a skin.

1st off, gotta say not having loot boxes is the way to go. Good job. 

2nd, skeletons are awesome and will always be.

Love this game a lot, it's fun whether you win or lose. I think people are going to be really excited for customization to evolve, especially the hardcore fans. That said, I have some ideas to improve the cosmetic system, if anyone wants to listen. Don't know if EPIC even looks at these, but I'm gonna rant anyways.

Note: In addition to the earnable skins, paid skins can be the much more impressive and showy ones, and I'm going to say leave Pickaxe and Parachute mods to be paid only.

•1: Gun Challenge Skins

-Basically, skins for completing challenges with different weapons and challenges.

EXAMPLES

      SNIPER: Get 100 kills with a sniper rifle.
       REWARD: Ghillie Suit

      RIFLE/BURST RIFLE: Get 100 kills with any rifle.
       R: Soldiers Uniform

      REVOLVER: Get 100 kills with a revolver.
       R: Cowboy costume

--

•2: Achievement Skins

-Skins for completing small, hidden tasks. No hints as to what you have to do to unlock these.

EXAMPLES 

    1: Shoot someone dead before they land.
     R: Paratrooper Uniform

    2: Kill 50 People while standing in water .
     R: Scuba Gear

    3: Build 1,000 walls, floors, ramps, or roofs.
     R: Constuction Uniform

  --

   •3: Location-Specific Skins
 
   -You know how everybody has their favorite place to drop? That one favorite spot? This section focuses on giving players costumes according to their favorite hangouts.

   EXAMPLES

       1: Kill 200 Players in Tomato Town
        R: Fast Food Employee Outfit

       2: Kill 200 Players in Pleasant Park
        R: Jogging Outfit

       3: Kill 200 Players in Flush Factory
        R: Plumber's Uniform

       4: Kill 200 Players in Retail Row
        R: Store Clerk Uniform

That's all I got for now. Hope y'all like my ideas.

They wouldn't interfere with cosmetics and there would be a lot of different abilities players could gain. I'm thinking they could be in a new slot like the pickaxe, and would always be active.

Here are some shoe ideas:

* Running shoes. Speed buff while sprinting. 

* Slippers. Walk silently, run quietly. 

* Space shoes. Jump higher.

* Frog shoes. Walk on water (If they made these a guaranteed drop at the Island I feel like it would really encourage drops there). 

* Rollerskates. Crouch to activate the skates and quickly skate down hills.

I was also thinking of some iron/rubber boots that gave protection against traps, but i'm thinking that might be too situational.

Aim at the center of your screen and constantly tap left trigger. Everything feels normal right? Okay great. Now keep tapping left trigger and try moving your aim slightly to the left or right. WTF right? See how your aim is snapped back to the center of the screen where you were aiming before? Even though you were clearly trying to aim to the left or right?

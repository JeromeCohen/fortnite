So, it’s no news that console is in a pretty bad state right now. However, the Switch version is in such a bad state right now that the game is pretty much unplayable, and the Xbox/ps4 versions can’t even compare. Here’s what’s going on in the Switch world:

Before I hit the big problems, will we ever get our stats? Replays?

First, a big problem but honestly the smallest of current issues. Gyro controls do not work well. Some people report it works great with the joycons but IMO the best way to play Fortnite on Switch is with a pro controller. Gyro with the pro controller is simply awful. Modeling the controls after Splatoon2 would make them perfect.

Problems joining/playing with friends. I personally have not had this problem but have seen many others unable to join friends. Quoted from a user in the Fortnite Switch LFG chat: “It's so annoying cause if someone joins me it shows they are in my lobby but when we both ready up it just perpetually states ""loading...100%"" down the bottom.”

Voice chat is broken. At first, I blamed my apple headphones and roasted my friend for using cheap skullcandy headphones. When we played with a switch friend who has some expensive logitechs and his voice didn’t work, that’s when we knew there was a problem. Our PC friend says we all sound super laggy but we can hear him just fine. 

Freeze frames right when you land. As soon as you hit a roof of a building or wherever it may be, you may or not teleport randomly. Sometimes, you may have bit of time to grab something but it won’t matter because you’re likely dead as soon as your game comes back. GG. [Example 1](https://streamable.com/kizuq) and [Example 2](https://streamable.com/r4jur)

If you landed in a spot with lots of people or buildings, you’re probably screwed. Textures take time to load, which is unacceptable. I call this “getting PUBG’d” because that’s how bad the game looks. How am I supposed to do anything if it looks like I’m playing on a N64? The worst part happens if you happen to land on one of these unloaded textures, because you’ll be stuck floating in this unholy mess. [Example](https://streamable.com/x7iun) Note: to be totally fair, this video was taken a couple weeks ago. It happens very rarely now (to me at least).

Continuing on from the last one: Places with lots of people and/or buildings will lag like crazy. You don’t need both for this to happen. as once I landed Tilted in solo with only 2 or 3 other people and my game still ran at like 5 fps. I’m not even exaggerating. Remember that swing glitch where if you sat on the swings for too long you started dropping frames like a madman? ([See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnSeqPnEfMA&amp;t=188s)) Yea it’s like that. However, if you get the deadly combo of lots of people AND lots of buildings, it gets even worse.

Further continuing on from my last point: a temporary thing that currently seems like the only problem with a chance to be fixed in the near future. The whole movie thing at Risky just plain sucks for Switch users. If there’s any fighting, the game will start moving at like 3 fps. Nice. What was once my favorite landing is now impossible to play in unless I’m in solo and it’s far from the bus.

Let’s say you land somewhere so remote and you have good loot, lots of materials, and you’re ready to fight. Exciting, right? Nope. Destiny still arrives. Even a regular ol’ landing gets laggy. ([Video Example](https://streamable.com/p7p93)) Even when you’re wandering around, you drop frames and it lags. [Look at this video](https://streamable.com/6xddg) and how choppy it gets just from walking around. This is unacceptable, though I suppose it really isn’t a problem till you find someone, which brings me to my last point…

_Even a regular squad fight in an open area is unbearable._ Seriously, how can you even play the game when the main part of it is impossible? My squad and I tried to play a game where we landed remote and camped so it wasn’t laggy. When we found a team, the lag hit us (by us, I mean me and one other guy because only 2 of us are on Switch) like a truck. [Look at this video.](https://streamable.com/gu3k9) Look at how choppy it is. I know it looks like I’m playing like a potato but that’s because whenever I pressed a button my action didn’t come out for a good second. I wish I had clipped other fights I’ve had, because this isn’t even the worst of it. Sometimes my game just straight up freezes. This happens almost every single battle, whether it’s solo, duo, or squad.

In conclusion, this game needs to be heavily optimized for the Switch. The most frustrating thing about it is that when the game first released on the Switch, it was perfectly fine. The game gets considerably worse every update, and it’s unbearable at this point. Every video in my post besides the one I noted was taken in the last two days, after the latest update. Just the other day after the update, I looked at the item shop and was like, “damn, Tomatohead looks so much crispier than normal! Nice, Epic!” Then I hopped into a match and it was just awful. Seriously Epic, you guys are one of the best dev teams out there with how well you listen to the fans. But for us neglected Switch users, you guys need to cut the graphics crap and make this game playable. 

TLDR: Fortnite for Switch is in an awful state and us Switch users feel neglected. From rendering issues to unbearable frame drops, the game is somehow even getting worse every update. Please fix this or eventually we won’t even be able to play.

(Oh and please bring back the Boneless emote, it has not been in the shop since before the Switch version released)

Hello ! I'm a Reddit user that plays Fortnite.

But recently I got this problem saying

""\[INFO\] Blocked loading of file: ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsflt.dll"".""

and it won't let me launch Fortnite.

I've been trying to delete that dll file, but it doesn't let me because a .exe file is opened and it's called ""systems.exe| and apparently winsflt.dll is related to that .exe file.

I've been trying finding that .exe, but it won't let me close it since i need permission from ""TrustedUser"".

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, while being bored watching Fortnite on Twitch, I had a crazy idea that (in my mind) will change twitch viewing experience forever. I thought it through and have been pouring all my blood, sweat and tears on it since then. I quit my job along with my best friend, and we have been working on it every day, day and night for the past 3 months to make it happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Like everybody here, I love to watch my favorite streams, but I felt the need to spice things up a bit. We've been working very hard on this concept - a live prediction platform, in which viewers can predict what will happen next to the streamer in-game. Will Ninja kill someone with a trap? Will Tfue get an amount of kills in a certain amount of time? And more. 

&amp;#x200B;

By predicting correctly, you win credits, which when accumulated enough, can be turned into rewards like V-Bucks, shirts, tags and actual money in a marketplace. The business model is powered by non-invasive ads: You can’t buy credits; you can only earn them. and if you need more, you can get them, mostly by choosing to view an ad. 

&amp;#x200B;

It'll be awesome if you guys would help us by trying it out, giving us feedback so it will become a more immersive experience for everyone. If everything works well, we will get funded and could really turn the platform into something x10 more than it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I am here to answer any questions you guys might have, thank you all in advance!

Now there is a workaround. If you have BE and are experiencing FPS Drop you can Switch to EAC with this method:

1- close fortnite and epic games launcher
2- Window+ R : Type Regedit
3 Find HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Epic Games\Unreal Engin \Identifiers
4- click machineid value and change it to DUMMYID ( the result should be machineid=DUMMYID)
5- start the game. If EAC launcher pop up , the method work and most likely you will not experience anymore FPS drop and performance issue.

Make the emote loop when activated, and if the player wants to make it stop, he/she needs to press that button again. ",FortNiteBR

And that is the issue of stairs rotating.

It's entirely due to the terrible design choice of having the same button (R3) for both rotating and crouching. And more generally, having the build rotation on any stick (even when not tied to crouching) is a terrible idea. Because you always end up hitting it even when you don't intend to when moving the camera (R3) or yourself (L3). This always means death. Yes, always. Even when you somehow manage to beat your opponent, the next one pushing you for an easy backstab will kill you because of it.

At some point, I got rid of this behavior by mapping crouch to X. But it seriously hinders your crouch play. So, now, I am using the popular L3 for crouch (and R3 for jump), and it's back again to be a terrible nightmare with rotating stairs...

Please, Epic, this can easily be fixed. Just put rotating on triangle for instance. You never need to quickly switch to pickaxe when in build mode, circle + triangle is just as good for that. Which leaves triangle for another action in build mode.

TL;DR: Putting the build rotating action on triangle (don't know about the xbox button) would be a life saver on console.",FortNiteBR

What if we had a throwable, like a port-a-fort or a rift-to-go that spawned any weapon of your choosing. A visual aided list with pictures of all weapons available would pop up on screen after using this item giving user the ability to choose any weapon they want.to immediately spawn. This would obviously be a legendary (gold) item, UNLESS.. Epic wanted different rarities similar to vending machines.

So..
An uncommon (green) Pick-A-Weapon would allow you to choose from all common (white) guns.

A rare (blue) Pick-A-Weapon would allow you to choose from all uncommon (green) guns.

An epic (purple) Pick-A-Weapon  would allow you to choose from all rare (blue) guns.

A legendary (gold) Pick-A-Weapon would allow you to choose from all epic (purple) guns.

Doing it this way would create some balance for the item, by not being able to spawn anything legendary.
I feel if it was just a single legendary item only gold guns would be chosen. Also doing it by rarity would also cover every weapon as there are no weapons that are only legendary.

Cameron is such a thoughtful, kind and considerate little boy. He enjoys spending time with his family, playing on his Xbox (Minecraft is his favourite!) ,building Lego and watching his Father play the wonderful game that is r/FortNiteBR! (He’s a bit too young to play just yet!)

4 months ago, Cam was attacked at school by a boy much older and bigger than him whilst going to the bathroom. [He had his face smashed into the wall of the bathroom and then stamped on whilst laying on the floor.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/PkGGQQR)

Although this has since been dealt with in the correct manor, Cam has suffered immensely. He no longer socialises with anyone, he doesn’t like loud noises, and has developed severe social anxiety.

This is a shame as Cam is due to start school again on the 4th of September, and is terrified at the thought.

We are working hard to ensure that he can trust people again and not be as anxious when it comes to friends/school.

On the 6th of September Cam will turn 7. Every year since he started Nursery he has had a birthday party at a soft play centre which all of his school friends attended. This isn’t the case this year as he is terrified of any child in case the same thing happens again. 

This is where I’m hoping you guys can come in. I’m wondering if anyone is able to send him a card, wishing him happy birthday so he can see that not everyone in the world is out to get him. He’s learning to read himself currently so I think he’d enjoy reading any lovely messages!

Please feel free to ask me any questions, and please delete if not allowed!

Thankyou! :)

Step 2: Make Samsung account and download Fortnite via online or Galaxy shop. The download will take from 10-30 minutes depending on the place's WiFi speed. You SHOULD see the Galaxy Skin promotion and the instructions in the process, if not then it's already claimed and you gotta find another device.

Step 3:  Sign in and play 3 matches. Leaving match won't count. PLEASE SIGN OUT AFTERWARD AND CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD ASAP.

Step 4: Wait for 24-48 hours to receive the Galaxy Skin. I got mine 11 hours later and it can be in ANY platform to receive this skin.

With that in mind, I feel like the best course of action is to put a cooldown timer on placing objects at least every 2 pieces you put down in quick succession.

Now in Season 5, after reaching Tier 100, you don’t have anything to do. We asked for the 100 Tier Challenges to be changed after season 4, but we got it so the challenges can be completed after the season ends, which makes the term “challenge” useless.

What we need are challenges like this

**Get XXX Number of Kills**

**Get XXX Number of Kills with XXX Weapon**

**Win XX Matches**

**Open XX Supply Drops**

And many more challenges.

Making the Tier 100 Challenge having to deal with XP is just tedious, and now that it can be completed after the season is useless, so let’s keep the challenge in the season and not have to do with XP

You totally rock the fight with your squad - you know what I mean. Aaaand there is this one guy... Instead of fight along with the other team, he goes for the kill... 
Then you have to play the rest of the game, with one, two or three players down, because of this one suicidal guy... 

Sometimes you get lucky and win. Other times you win without much effort. But it isn't very rewarding, when your teammates always get thirsted in a fight...

So here is my suggestion:

- Teammates can get thirsted down to 50hp or less, within a given radius, e.g. 50-100 meters. And then lose hp, 1-2 per sec, as normal.

- Teammates outside this radius can get killed.

Then it's more rewarding to be close to your teammates, and play as a team.

If this is too OP for the highly skilled playerbase, there is always a possibility to set the limit to one time per game, per player. So if you get downed once, you can get thirsted next time you'll get knocked.

Basically, what I'm thinking is that Drift was actually sent by people from our world through the rifts that The Visitor made. The Visitor was sent to evaluate the Fortnite world, Drift was sent to communicate with the inhabitants without causing disruption (after stealing a rocket, the visitor isn't exactly liked.)

My evidence for this is that in the season 5 trailer, Drift is listening to a song clearly associated with the Fortnite world. I think that the song was actually created by The Visitor to communicate with Drift, or is a log of communications between the two. Either one fits.

The song also associates itself directly with a robot/god writing it and lyrics associating with purposeful and previous interactions from humans with the Fortnite world.

""Yeah, I'm in town, for the day AGAIN.""

Meaning that humanity has already been to the Fortnite world.

""We're not like you, you'd never understand."" 

This relates to The Visitor being not like the Fortnite characters or humans.

I can add more evidence later if needed.",FortNiteBR

277,BrandonGrave02,1535246241,9abvjp,29,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9abvjp/enforcer_and_fortnite_skins/,17,Enforcer and Fortnite Skins,"Lots of posts hating on the new Enforcer skin have emerged saying that his lower half feels rushed: it looks plain. As such people have posted ideas for a ""unique"" or ""less plain"" pants option, and while normally I think this stuff is ok I these posts worry me. Being up front I love the design of Enforcer: he looks stealthy, lightweight and almost like some futuristic shadow ninja (instead of parachute pants he has baggy cargo pants). Because I like the design I am biased here however what I worry about is Epic actually listening.

Epic is known to listen to reddit A LOT going so far as to add extra lighting options for Omega and Carbide (more notable example), so thinking about them actually doing something with Enforcer -- based on reddit feedback -- doesn't seem unreasonable. The problem I have with this possibility and the reddit posts asking for a change to Enforcer is -- it doesn't consider the players who like Enforcer's design. I am only one person here and while my opinion means very little it is important to note that even the majority of reddit posts in favor of a skin change are a minority too. If Epic were to listen and consider what maybe 10k redditors felt about the skin, they could upset another 100k (non-reddit users) who felt the opposite. 

It is worth noting that most players feel as though the skin they've completed 7 weeks worth of challenges for should be special -- I absolutely agree. In fact it's because I agree that I must admit that the Visitor from S4 felt extremely underwhelming. Truthly I don't enjoy the Visitor's design in the slightest and think the cape makes 0 sense whatsoever, but I know others do like the Visitor (e.g. my best friend) so although I can't enjoy the skin I accept the fact that others do. So what do I do then? I wear a skin that I like: I use a skin whose design matches my preferences (usually BK). Again, I understand wanting the skin you've completed 7 weeks worth of mind numbing, brain-dead challenges for (F those search chest challenges) to be special, but unfortunately what people like is subjective and no-one will ever be satisfied.

In closing, Enforcer might be plain, he might seem ""too ordinary"" for his unlock and his design might not suit your taste but I guarantee other players do like Enforcer and would be devastated if he were changed because others didn't. ",FortNiteBR

They logged me out and linked my psn to their account. I lost save the world and my battle royal skins plus dances. They mock me by changing my display name to some horrendous racial slur I wouldn't use ever. Today I took a chance and downloaded fortnite mobile. I could log in and see my skins. I was happy but then I see tier 100. I had 495 vbucks. How? I checked I noticed they used my 3 refunds to return my panda skin I just got plus two more items.

So here is the delima, should I delete the account and psn or wait for epic to help? If I do I plan on deleting the psn so my stuff won't transfer to whoever have my information.

But now that it's finally happening, I'm a little bummed out. I know the skin hasn't officially been released yet, so maybe it's still subject to change? But the backbling has let me down big time.  


The peace symbol has a very powerful meaning and history behind it, so I would hate for it to be displayed inaccurately on the backbling of this skin, especially when it's done correctly on the necklace.  This may seem small to some of you, and you may just pass this off as those ""dirty hippies"" complaining like they always do. But this symbol and the history of this symbol means a lot to some people, including myself. So I guess my hope is that I can bring a little attention to this and that hopefully Epic somehow sees it and is able to change it, or it will be the ultimate bummer on what will otherwise be the best skin in the game!  


[Here is an image I put together as an example.](https://i.redd.it/6h2diaf8gbi11.png)

This is a small article about the symbol for anyone interested: [A brief history of the peace symbol](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/style-origins-peace-symbol/index.html)  


Here are some excerpts/quotes taken from the article for a TL;DR  


 *The design is meant to represent the letters ""N"" and ""D"" -- standing for ""nuclear disarmament"" -- as they appear in the semaphore alphabet, which is used by sailors to communicate from a distance with flags.*   


 *In the US, the symbol was first used by the civil rights movements. It was probably imported by Bayard Rustin, a close collaborator of Martin Luther King Jr., who had participated in the London march in 1958. Crossing the Atlantic, the symbol lost its association with nuclear disarmament and came to signify, more generally, peace""*  


*""It's such a powerful symbol with a sort of hypnotic appeal.""*  \-*Ken Kolsbun, a peace symbol historian*  


 *""It's a minor masterpiece with major evocative power,"" said design guru and cultural critic, Stephen Bayley, ""It speaks very clearly of an era and a sensibility. It is, simply, a fine period piece: the ordinary thing done extraordinarily well.""*   


 *""It's an amazing design. Big corporations would die for something like this -- just look at how many have their logos in a circle.* ***Not surprisingly, some people draw it incorrectly, without the bottom line, and unwittingly draw the Mercedes logo.""***

Who ever owns the original and buys the updated one can have the customization tab available for that skin.

And for someone who doesn't own the original skin has to pay 2000 v-bucks for the updated version and can no longer get the original.

It’s crazy how crappy controller is compared to keyboard and mouse. I’m still a potato on mouse and keyboard but everything you need is one click away, there is instant edits, no entering and exiting build mode, and you have so much control over your movement and shots.

Once you get to a certain point on console, a 50% win rate player is hard to distinguish between a 20% win rate player, because there are so many things limiting the top console guys, such as clunky edits and you either play on a fast sens and miss shots or a low sens and build slow.

I don’t care if I get matched against pc guys soon. I’m sticking to what’s most efficient for now (I’ll plug in controller every now and then once custom buttons comes out)

This means if I build a wall and then decide to edit down or accidentally build a floor above me while ramping, I can't just edit and keep going. We then have to switch back to the floor, edit, then back to ramp to keep going. This shit is ridiculous and has been a bug in game for at least 2-3 weeks. To me this seems like a huge issue that should have been fixed two patches ago but here we are. Editing is already bad on console but now it's damn near impossible in a build fight. I've seen this mentioned a couple times but no longer hear anything about it and haven't seen anything from edit.

[https://gyazo.com/dabd8e6e6b76fe9569a5d86f39755925](https://gyazo.com/dabd8e6e6b76fe9569a5d86f39755925)  

&amp;#x200B;

The description of the skin is ""The future looks bright..."" which it´s not weird at all, but then you have that brite bomber is in every loading screen of this season which is about time traveling. She also looks very familiar with Drift, which comes from another place and time. So here´s my theory:

&amp;#x200B;

Brite bomber and Drift knew eachother from before and had close relationship (maybe really good friends or couple) and lived in the same place and time, the future. This future its some sort of post-apocaliptic world, currently living in a chaos  with zombies (save the world). Then Brite bomber decides to go back in time and try to solve their situation by stopping the bad guys that started all. Who are the bad guys? The visitor. She ruins the rocket so it doesn´t hit Tilted towers, the main city of the island. But... how did she go back in time? port-a-rift. Port-a-rift is futuristic technology, so she used it, but instead of taking her to the sky, it took her back in time (maybe she modified with someone elses help, perhaps Drift). Then she feels like she needs more help so she makes Drift come to the past and help her defeat the visitor.  

&amp;#x200B;

So when she says ""The future looks bright.."" she actually means that her plan of saving the future (where drift and brite bomber lived) is working so far, or at least thats what I think :p

(This might help others who are still waiting),"Okay so I just typed this whole entire thing and accidentally closed the page, so I'm going to try and make this quick and short.   
Went to Bestbuy with a friend on release day  
2 Note 9's, and 1 Tab S4 on display  
Great WiFi already connected. ( I was prepared to use a hot-spot, but I didn't need to)

Logged into Samsung shop with a throwaway Samsung account (One thing to note here is the only reason why a Samsung account is required is because you can't download apps from the appstore without it. It has nothing to do with achieving the skin.)  


Proceeded to install the installer from Galaxy Apps. Opening the Installer I got the message about playing 3 games and then waiting 24-48 hours. (Another thing to note is that at the time, Fortnite will not be accessible through Galaxy Apps on a Tab S4. That could change in the future, but all you have to do is go to epics Fortnite website, and click Samsung on the android promotional.)  


Finished installing and patching and got two games in until the phone reset. This is not the employees fucking with you. Samsung phones on Demo Display mode will automatically wipe and reset every 10-15 minutes or so. The reason why I ran out of time on my first go is because if you don't keep touching the screen, a demo video will automatically play, and if this happens it'll suspend the in game installation on Fortnite.  


So I restarted the entire process and played 7 matches to be sure I completed the task. I was able to bang out 7 matches because all I did was jump out the bus and fly over the water until I died.  


10 Hours later I open up Fortnite on PC, and I still have no skin. I proceed to browse all the new threads about the Galaxy Skin. After painfully reading all the ""Know It all's"" who claim you can only get it on a note 9 through pre-oder, and that it's impossible to do it on a display phone, I found a post that I caught my eye.  


I close down Fortnite on PC and update my android version. (Galaxy S8+)  I open it up and I was instantly greeted with a congratulations on my Samsung promotion. I close it and I go to the shop, but there's no Free skin, but then I saw a notification in my locker. To my luck there it is already waiting for me.  


This could be a major coincidence on timing, but my theory is that I got it immediately because I used my own Samsung device. The reason why I did this is because I read a post about someone who did the same thing I did, and he got his a lot sooner because he decided to check his Galaxy S9.  


If this doesn't help this post is also insurance on the fact that you absolutely can receive the skin through a display phone. As long as you're the first one to do it. I talked to the Bestbuy and employees and they said we were the only ones to do this and this was around 12 p.m.

As a preface, i'll just say that I play on PS4. I'm a pc and console player, I just like to get best of both worlds. However i got hooked on fortnite PS4 back in october. I'm usually a scrub in video games but I'm somewhat decent at this game. Winrate about 16%, usually 30% in early Season while I try hard.

However, after season 5, i'll be quiting fortnite. The reasons are multiple.

- my main grief, as a european player, is how lazy the netcode is. Don't get me wrong, I realize having servers that can handle 100 players and all their building can be a hard task. But if games like Battlefield 3 (it's 7 years old now) could run 128 players and be playable, there is no reason for Epic to fail at providing a satisfying experience for 100 players, with that number quickly going down.

- the fact that there is no server between EU and Asia. Everyone from the arabic countries in between are forced to choose either, and because of the trash netcode, they ruin the game for people. That's what happens when you drop a 200+ ping player on a Bad netcode game. They hit through structures (because the hit registry happens on the shooter client. 200ms basically means the personnes can shoot you 0.2 seconds after the wall was placed.)

- on top of that, the ping shown is absolutely fake. I'm always prompted 50 ms, while the actual calculation is around 200. Why show us the ping if it's fake ?

- it's a low blow to bring money in this topic, but Epic is making billions. Literally. A company making billions is still running the same flawed game after so long. 

- their creatives are very limited. I'm sure they are actually very skilled, but the fact that they are pressured to implement stupid changes that Reddit whined for is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, community feedback is fine when constructive, but the vocal part of Reddit are freaking crybabies that are slowly ruining the game.

- the e-sport side is only at its start, so I can't say much yet. But PLEASE understand that it's not *just* for kids, and that kids end up enjoying a football/soccer match just as much, they don't need it dumbed down for them.

- the coding slopiness. They will say they patched one thing only to break it again in the next patch. I can't count how many times the ""chests appearing unopened from a distance"" bug has come and go. How many times the trap bugs were fixed only for it to come back in the very next patch.

- on the other hand, the only thing that's moving on quite well is the paid cosmetics. I've never seen any game pushing out those so fast. I understand it's any company's goal, but it's a shame to cash in that much without offering a proper gameplay. If Epic had a coding team as efficient as their cosmetics designer, this would be the best game ever.

TL;DR: i quit because this game should be in a finale state by now, considering how much grossing the game generates, but that money is only invested in more cosmetics. Very little is done to have a proper, playable and reliable game.",FortNiteBR

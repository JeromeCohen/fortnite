Bottled 4 solo squads (one with 22k), recently keep dying in SOLO PUBS to the most trivial things; just played a bit today and in my  last 25 games I had a 2.6kd; which is very low for me (usually around 4-10 range). I play passive; first or second engagement I bottle due to low confidence. I play aggro, clear the POI then when I get pinched I screw up the most trivial of builds. My last 5 games before I just rage quitted I got only 2 kills and that was in 1 game. I've tried taking periodic breaks but It isn't working, feel like I'm no longer cut out for fortnite like before as I used to stomp pubs so easily, even in the evening on PC EU.

6,Gary4927,1537310945,9gzmzk,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9gzmzk/myth_spreading_severely_incorrect_information/,10,Myth spreading severely incorrect information about aim assist on console (When talking about console vs pc),"I've just watched a clip of myth talking about why console players shouldn't be playing alongside pc players competitively, but what he said is completely wrong. 

To quickly sum up his point, he felt it made no sense for controller players to play as they have an ""auto aim"" feature, saying it's much easier for controller players to aim and flick in CQC. 

This is so wrong. It's frustrating as a console player to have someone of his influence spread such incorrect information. First of all, calling aim assist ""auto aim"" is ridiculous. Aim assist is a feature made up of a light lock on feature and a slowdown option, the latter of which essentially lowers your sensitivity when aiming close to where an enemy is. The lock on feature is now extremely light as of a recent update to stop controller players abusing it and essentially does nothing, and still required you to aim extremely close to your enemy.

Aim assist is undeniable not an advantage that controller has over pc and merely allows console players be able to keep up with pc. Aiming with a mouse is 100 times superior to controller aiming with aim assist, and aim assist certainly shouldn't be labelled ""auto aim"" 

TL;DR: There is absolutely no aspect of aim assist that gives console players ""auto aim"". It simple allows controller players to actually be able to hit enemies and without it aiming is literally impossible. It stills takes a great deal of skill to aim on console and is much harder than aiming on pc, anyone who thinks otherwise is uniformed and shouldn't be spreading this information to their thousands of viewers.

Excluding the double barrel for obvious reasons, do you usually aim for a headshot with your shotgun and accept the increased chances of missing, or do you go for a body shot that's usually easier to hit and then quickly follow up with your secondary?

I'm asking this because I feel like I'm always going for headshots which ends up with me missing a lot more shots.

Honestly playing this game feels like you are being punished for being half decent and I know they cater to new players but seriously the game itself is so good the concept is amazing. I hope that Epic push out a half decent competitive system as that's probably the only thing that will make the 10% of the community enjoy being competitive with the game and know that people within their lobby are good players.

His argument being along the lines of “Console players claim they can build just as good as PC players so why do they still need aim assist. why do they need ‘auto aim’ if they can build like us”. (not exactly his words but a gist). i can’t help but think if aim assist is SUCH a broken mechanic then why don’t all the PC players just switch to console then? wouldn’t we see pros flicking over to controller if that were the case?don’t get me wrong, Keyboard and Mouse is obviously the best way to play fortnite but to claim that aim assist is “auto aim” and that controllers shouldn’t be allowed to play against PC players is just foolish.

Having the ability to edit properly + Aim Assist will generate an unfair advantage. 

I have been watching controller players. From Pub Stompers to Pro to semi pro scrim sweat controller players. Almost all of them spam the ADS to abuse/utilize the aim assist. While aim assist is vital to many controller players, I feel the new edit should be a toggle that when enabled will automatically disable aim assist.

Controller players will have a clear advantage in close range build fights. IE: End game Pro and really any competitive situation where each player is surrounded by builds and double barrels weilding nerds.
ALL end game top tier play ends in very close(within a 1x1 or 1x2). We turtle, we tunnel, we dodge, we splode, we manuever to get all the surrounding areas ""Owned"" like some fucked up monoply game...THEN we proceed to EDIT and aim.

This is NOT a debate on whether or not Aim Assist is OP. 


TLDR: Part of the reason AA was even put in the first place, was because of other restritictions. IE:Building and Editing. Both of these things have now been Reworked to a much better place. But mark my words.

With the Accessibility settings on your console, you can move your O (B) and X (A) to D-pad slots, and bring those D-pad slots to your controller face. You can move around whatever you like, but this is what my controller set up looks like currently. O is my material change (left D-pad) X now opens my inventory (up D-pad) and circle is now my auto run. Most importantly in my opinion, I was able to move traps/reload/interact off the face buttons and to my L3, so I don't have to take my thumb off the right stick to place traps or pick up items/reload.

YEARS of gamers at high end PROS have said aiming with a mouse is more of an advantage even against a controller with aim assist. 

He said the summer skirmish standings show that console players have an advantage because of their kills. He's so delusional it's insane. Console players got high placements because they actually played their game (which was going for kills) instead of turtling up. He doesn't even realise console doesn't have aim assist when not aimed in and said console players have crazy flicks. This guy is absolutely finished. Shitting on console players efforts because he can't even place.

I'd also like to add, does anyone feel a lot of pro Fortnite Players focus way too much on building instead of actually shooting?

With this system, many people have found shotguns other than the double-barrel to be too unreliable. A potential solution to this would be to increase the amount of damage that each individual pellet does, while also putting a cap on the maximum damage each shot can do. For example, an uncommon pump shotgun currently does a maximum of 80 damage to the body, meaning that each pellet accounts for 8 damage. I am suggesting that each pellet could do something like 16 damage instead, while the maximum damage of the shotgun would remain the same. This would make it so any shotgun shot of 5 or more pellets would count as a max damage shot, and the damage of any shot of 4 or fewer pellets would be doubled from what it is currently. This would apply for all shotguns other than the double-barrel shotgun, as most would agree that it is already sufficiently strong. ",FortniteCompetitive

In order to have squads represented well, we need a format that is easy to watch, entertaining, and highlights squads’ communication-based and generally less rng nature. The most important aspect of competitive squads: Only 10-12 teams per lobby. PUBG is played on an 8x8km map, and for its comp it uses a 20 team lobby, which works out beautifully. Fortnite is played on a 2.5x2.5km map, which makes for less space to work with. Add the shorter circle times as well and we’re down to half the lobby packed into the 5th circle. The benefit of these small lobby sizes would decrease rng as well, because squads would have entire regions of the map to work with. One team could go risky and push wailing, another could go to paradise, another could go to retail, another could go salty and push up divot, another could go tilted and push loot lake, another could go flush and push yonder yard, another could go greasy/Viking and push shifty, another could go to junk/haunted and push pleasant/loot lake, another could go lazy, etc. That’s 9/10-12 viable locations where entire teams would have the loot there to themselves, which would in turn 70% take away the rng factor. The smaller lobby sizes will also make team fights much simpler, less messy/more entertaining to watch, and a decreased risk of third partying. One common complaint about competitive fortnite is that a lack of incentive on kills encourages camping, but in turn a lack of incentive on placement takes away the point of a BR game. My proposal: A modified Hold the Throne would be perfect for squads. Victory Royales are worth 2 points, top 3 is worth 1 point, and for squads, if a squad manages to get past the 10 elimination mark it is a bonus point for them. Instead of there being a point cap to end the tournament, it should be played in 10 games instead to further decrease rng and to test how well squads are able to deal with adversity after a bad game. 

Apologies for poor formatting, I’m on mobile. Would really appreciate to hear your thoughts on how squads should be represented in comp Fortnite! ",FortniteCompetitive

The average player base has just gotten too good to spam with ARs. I can’t think of a situation where they’re really that practical. They also mean you have to stand still so you can get sniped or even lasered yourself from behind or above or a random mountain.

What I’ve noticed running AR is I just miss out on more minis, because the guy will always base up and drink my minis before I get to kill him.

Thoughts?

My favorite and most OP loadout right now is:
- Heavy/Pump
- P90 or SMG
- Sniper
- grappler
- heals

The sniper for me is indispensable as a counter weapon. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been shot at from a mountain or some guy builds a 1x1 and just keeps spamming me from 3 floors above, and all I do is aim up and headshot him. I rarely get snipes trying to hit someone walking in the forest or distance, so I don’t even bother, but it’s amazing as a counter weapon for AR spam, because even if you build, a gold scar will always manage to leak through and randomly hit shot you for 70 shield.",FortniteCompetitive

I think everyone in the competitive side is hoping this to be what we are expecting. A fully fleshed out design on a new mode / playlist dedicated to competitive players.

A new UI design / leaderboard system that tracks your wins, how many points you've gained over your placement games, how many points you need to rank up to the next league.

A ladder system where you have to rank up to the highest league, kills grant you points as does wins. Balancing this will be tough but a strong incentive for kills would be a good start.

Leagues such as 

- Bronze 

- Silver 

- Gold

- Platinum

- Masters

[Daequan](https://i.gyazo.com/b4c08368da0b29f75587f57354401893.png) also made a twitter post a while back, regarding a similar competitive system, so many players are dying for a mode like this right now.

Now onto the actual gamemode, the features, how long a match would last, the weapons and gadgets available.

I personally think the gamemode should be showdown royale with Blitz features and material farming rates x2.

Certain weapons and gadgets vaulted for this mode for example the Grappler gun, RPG, Minigun, C4's.

Weapons that give an overwhelming advantage ^ and increase the RNG.

I think this is needed for Fortnite right now, for competitive players like myself the main mode isn't doing much for me right now. Scrims is the only place where I feel the fun in this game really shines. Pubstomping after a while gets very tedious.

This could also add a whole new series for streamers to partake in. Road to masters league would be very exciting to watch. To see which rank your favourite fortnite streamers will place

Full headshot damage would be 214.5 and 225.
(Keep in mind the double barrel has a very wide spread and quick damage fall off, so hitting a shot worth over 200 would have to be a skilled barrel stuff to the face with only 1 chance.) It would still be worthy of its rarity due to its high base damage and 1 tap potential. 

I’ve spend some time thinking about how to balance the double barrel better and this is what I came up with. It’s how I envisioned the sawed off when it was first announced. I was disappointed to see it be released as body shot gun that can do close to 300dps! That’s way higher than every other gun in the game. I’d rather they re-work it, than remove it completely.

Basically I’ve been playing in the FNPL console discord (PS4) and have found it to be ridiculously easy. I have roughly a 15-20% win rate in scrim matches when I play. That seems ridiculously high. 

However I don’t think it necessarily has to do everything with my personal skill and more with the players in the discord. Most of these guys are super aggressive and you will sometimes see lobbies with &lt;10 players left by the 3rd circle. Essentially they don’t play like scrim players. It can be frustrating to have a player force a ridiculous build fight on you while pushing the storm, but when I’m able to avoid that I usually place very well due to other players wasting their resources.

Is this the premiere console competition? Should i hook up a controller to PC like NickMercs? I honestly just want a lobby with 20 players alive in the moving circles. That’s all I ask for.

The player wasn't standing still, he was weaving and shooting someone during a rare opportunity to pressure during a build fight. It's not like he could have boxed off his sides and back - his opponent was between me and him.  


It's not like he could have known I was there with a sniper - my first shot from anywhere near that position was an instant kill from 130m+.  


For the second clip - is he just supposed to not engage at all for fear of getting sniped? It's a perfectly accurate instant kill weapon that can be shot \*before\* a player peeks for his AR. What happens when people are \*incredibly\* good at these sorts of shots?

First, let me give you a little background on the whole thing. 

Ever since I started playing video games, I have always been using claw/spider mouse grip. 

Back in the season 1, when I started playing fortnite I bound my building keys to q,f,c (wall, stair, floor). I have changed my pyramid &amp; editing keys a couple times. The ""qfc"" was like a holy trinity for me. 

In the season 2&amp;3 I was very good at the game. If I wanted to win I could do it without any problems. But that wasnt important for me. I preferred kills. 

When the season 4 came out I was still decent at the game. I could win some games but it wasnt as easy. At the end of season I started worrying about the future of the game. (Adding a lot of unnecessary weapons and nerfing skill mechanics).

So, when the season 5 started I took a little break from fortnite (about 5-6 weeks). When I came back and played for a while I have noticed something. I cant win as many building fights as I used to. 
I thought that everyone has improved so much during my break so I went on YouTube looking for some tutorials. I found some pushing techniques and turning 90°.
I have been practicing in playground for almost a week now. This helped me a little but Im still missclicking my floors too much and Im too slow.  I feel like I just cant speed it up without fucking my builds.

I think that I should change my binds. I played around with my bindings but I always end up going back to my holy trinity. (Qfc)

From what I saw, having binds on mouse speeds up the building a lot. I ve tried it. My issue is that Im using claw/spider grip. So, when im building Im having hard time flicking and controlling my mouse.

What do you suggest:

-should i change my mouse grip to make these binds work?

-should i play around with bindings on keyboard?

-should i stick to my qfc?

**What if players in competitive matches could see the full path the storm would take before the match started?** Hear (read) me out.

- I'm personally against changes that would lead to pros playing a game that's fundamentally different from pubs. While this is obviously *a* change, it's on the metagame level, affecting planning and strategy rather than the way the game actually works on a mechanics or balance level.

- Landing decisions would arguably gain strategic depth. Players could choose to land outside the circle to avoid confrontation and mat up knowing they have distance to cover. We might see more action early on inside the 1st/2nd circles. Players might try to land directly in the 3rd/4th circles and hold them, knowing they won't have to move for a long time, but also knowing they'll be pressured hard from all directions.

- It doesn't matter how good you are, once it gets to the 6th-7th circle in a competitive match, your chances of surviving go down significantly if you happen to be all the way across from the next one. They go up significantly if you're close. I want to see the people who do better at planning for the future movements be rewarded, not the people who luck out with the late circles.

- Ideally this change would be implemented so that you only got to see it in the lobby and maybe on the bus. Having to remember the path would be part of the skill involved.

There's been a lot of discussion about how to reduce the impact of RNG on competitive games without deviating from the BR spirit and having pros playing a completely different game. This change wouldn't actually affect the game itself like balance changes would, but it allows for a lot more planning and introduces new ways to show strategic prowess.

**I'm not, by any means, saying that the winners of competitive games are currently solely determined by the late circles.** The best players in the world are capable of playing endgames flawlessly regardless of how stacked the lobby is or where the circles go. But the late circles probabilistically affect every player, no matter how good, in a way that's currently impossible to strategize around.

This storm would be one minute slower and would stop a half block or so behind the first storm. The first storm would no longer break anything

Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like this new storm system was implemented to minimize the stress on the server but all it does is create chaos for all the scrim teams trying to make pro. Today i saw a scrim game go from 41 people to 9 off the first circle breaking. The vast majority of players just fall next to each other and then its every man for himself at point blank range. Whats even worse is the storm mechanics dont even work properly. Its nearly impossible to tell what is going to break because structures break that aren't supposed to (lag probably causes this).

With this second storm teams would be able to survive in the late game mega structures without the fear of randomly getting their floors broken under them. It would also accomplish relieving stress on the server by destroying all the old builds on the map.

I have a general problem that takes me down alot. Often when I get into a build battle, where i get outbuild by 2 or 3 floors because of a mistake i´ve done I usually dont rly know how to recover from that. Most of the time I build myself in and hope that the enemy goes a little bit down so I can recover, but if the enemy plays well he will keep the highground most of the time. If he does, im often clueless how to proceed. I often double ramp or ramp&gt;floor&gt;edit&gt;keep ramping. The thing is either i get shot down or i still get 1 or 2 hits and still dont rly have highground after that.

Is there any good videos that explain how to recover ? Or do you have any advices?

Its just that certain situation that keeps me away from getting more then decent in my build battles.

I think i’ve come up with a viable nerf that makes the item not overpowered, worth an inventory slot in scrims/ for serious use, and for fun in playground. I haven’t seen anybody else make this suggestion yet.

**My idea** is that both the grappler ammo size be reduced and that a timer be added in between each time that it’s fired.

First, the grappler ammo size should be reduce to anything  from 7 to 12. 5 is too little, nobody will use the grappler. 15 is too much, players continue to carelessly fire the grappler without putting any thought into positioning and get high ground over good players. In order to counter somebody using the grappler you have to spam build upwards, and with the grappler having 15 shots the player with the high ground will run out of mats and end up losing to the player who didn’t use any mats and just used a grappler.

Second, there should be a timer in between each shot of the grappler. The time should be anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds. The timer should be similar to the timer when switching in between shotguns, except it appears in between each time the grappler is fired and not when somebody is running double grappler. There should a timer in between shots should that people have to be more critical when firing shots with the grappler, so it becomes a more skill based item, but there should not be a timer when grapplers are being switched in between because in an actual match it would require another inventory slot for slightly more ease of use, and so that casual players can have fun in playground when running quadruple grappler or something 

**TLDR:**
i think the grappler should have a 8 shots per grappler and 10 seconds in between each shot.

&amp;#x200B;

While I don't want to put everyone into one basket, that seems to be the current meta setup suited for MOST situations and that is why it is run by most people. 

&amp;#x200B;

While there will always be a meta choice of a setup, I find myself torn between what to put into my flex spot in many situations. Examples of filling the Flex spot are Sniper/Scoped AR/Thermal AR/Shockwave grenade/Impulse grenade/Clinger/C4/Stinkbomb/Boogie bomb. All of these are great niche items, however, most of them will be outclassed by either another healing item (think you already have a stack of minis, and find one or more of another one) or by Splodes, because both of those will outclass the other flex items in the vast majorities of situations. The three weapons are currently too good in their roles to pass one of them up. No amount of utility or playmaking items will make up for having no health and so the healing slot is also non negotiable.

I am not even mentioning the Grappler here, as that item would currently fill my flex spot in almost any case, just for the mobility alone, but it will almost certainly get nerfed. Furthermore, Epic is adding items in a high frequency: Port a fortress got announced today, another item that belongs into the flex category.

And here lies the problem. We have a ton of items available, and a lot of underrated items too. But since we are so limited on slots, and the standard guns are so good, the meta setup prevails in almost all situations, which makes me sad because I really like the niche items. Of course, you could tell me now ""well if you like the items just run them"". Well, right now I just can't. If you are playing to win you can't give up any of the three main gun slots, you certainly can't give up healing and you also can't carry more than one flex item, and even the one flex slot will mostly be occupied by splodes/healing. This makes the flex items mere options that you use because the meta options aren't available, and as soon as they are, the flex gets discarded.

&amp;#x200B;

Solutions? Well, just adding another slot I think would be fine at this point. However, I can see why it wouldn't be a good idea, who will stop people from just carrying even more healing?

I propose to add a grenade slot/throwable slot similar to the trap slot. The slot would be able to hold a quantity of 5-10 throwables of any kind (maybe limited to 3 different items). Sure you would need to cycle grenades, but you cycle traps too, and grenades usually aren't something you pull out in the heat of the moment, you throw them from cover. ",FortniteCompetitive

Objectively, the pumps current role is a higher body shot, not as high headshot, whereas the heavy is the opposite. 

Did I miss anything? I feel like I’m missing stuff...

Also, I propose making the heavy available as floor loot, making the heavy body dmg 75-80 (although it’s still in a good state currently). Then the pump should be 90-95, keeping the 2x multiplier on the pump, and 2.5x on heavy. 

Are there any other changes?

I'd love if Epic introduced another shooting test, similar to how they did with implementing FSA and damage fall off, to test out recoil instead of bloom.

I’m not very good at solos. My highest kill win is 11 (12-14 for solo duos, can’t remember exactly). I have about 45 solo wins (2.34 win%). I’m really not that good compared to most of you. BUT in playground, I beat almost anyone I go against. That is because I am mechanically very skilled. 

When I duo with my cousin, we can get high kill wins. (Average wins consistently). Tbh I would say he’s not as mechanically gifted, But he is very good at the mental skills.

So when we duo or duo squad we do quite well. This has taught me that mental skills are just as important and essential to being a great player.

Do you guys think epic needs to find ways to stop it happening or do you just think its part of the game now? My theory for why it’s happening so much at the moment is because of a few reasons:
1: increased mobility around the map leads to people being able to spot fights easily 
2: players are getting better - as players are getting better at the game more building is happening during fights meaning its easier to be spotted from a distance. It’s also taking longer to finish fights which draws attention to other players 
3: not as many players mid game: Due to most players getting killed before the first circle this is having a huge game effect mid game - as there aren’t as many players to fight its ends up drawing attention to the fights that are happening which is where the third parting takes place

If rifts get taken out next season I think it could decrease the amount of third partying happening due to reduced mobility and less people dying early game.

I have played over 6500 games and I can still sometimes catch myself distracted by ambient noise, isn't that suppose to be in the background?

Many people have said that people like Swavy Luis (10 sensitivity playground builders) are much better players than Ghost Aydan. Swavy Luis and many others use max sensitivity and do literally only Playgrounds all day. 

Ghost Aydens overall skill is not even comparable to those guys since his aim and game iq is way above their level. Today was confirmed that even his building is above those 10 sens builders who lack in everything else.

Ghost Aydan won Swavy Luis in their 1v1s and Swavy Luis is considered one if not the best playground builders and got beaten by lower sensitivity, better overall player even in building.

Learn from this, don't put your sensitivity all way upto 9-10 if you're not 100% sure that you're able to handle it. I have never seen any 10 - 10 sensitivity player hitting their shots consistently.

I'd recommend using 7, 8 or 9 sensitivity and Y sensitivity one or two below your X sensitivity, example 8-6 (Aydan uses this).",FortniteCompetitive

Some are basic knowledge while others are not as widely known.

* The more you edit the same piece in rapid succession the weaker the starting HP. 

* You have to maintain aim on the piece you're trying to edit until you enter edit mode. In addition, if you try to edit without having your aim on it properly (while having your gun out) it will send you to build mode. In addition once you edit a wall there's a small ghost area in which you can still edit it without seeing it. This area is extremely small and I found it easier to edit pieces you can't see while in build mode.  

* While in build mode (map out) you can only edit the piece you have selected and ready to build. 

* You can edit pieces slightly further away while in build mode than you can otherwise. 

* You have to be within one box distance to edit a piece with your gun out. Also your edit will auto cancel once you are further than 1 build out.

* The right hand advantage is becomes the right hand disadvantage when trying to edit in certain situations. If you are in touching or very close to a wall you can edit on your right side even though you are aiming straight up you will go into edit mode on the wall to the right.

These are just a couple big ones I've noticed. I've also been slacking on my 90s so I decided to focus on it and see how fast I could build to the build limit (starting on ground level at tilted). After a bit of practice I was able to get it at 35 seconds which is the same time it took to reach build limit just by building straight ramps which I found pretty amusing. 

My only focus was to do least three 90s before building an extra ramp to reset the sprint/jump fatigue.

It's hard to counter without any unbreakable environmental cover and it still manages to laser you if you don't build. 

My idea is giving the minigun a new form of ammo, specific to the minigun, and capping it at 300-400. Enough to make the minigun effective, but not enough to waste 999 of your mats on one person holding left click.

The downside of this that I could see:

-	An increase of the types of ammo would make you less likely to get the exact type you want out of an ammo box.

None the less, I think it'd be an interesting move that would still keep the minigun good at what it's good for, just not for 2 minutes straight.

Curious to hear what the competitive community thinks.

Then, i thought to bring this concept to a larger scale. So i made a worldwide ranking system, trying to add as much regions as i could in it, and also trying my best to be as fair as possible with every one of them (wich is close to impossible). Here it is :

The first tab will answer a big part of the questions you might have, aswell as some of the other tabs explaining the tier/points systems, and the list of tournaments used to build this ranking.

I will get comments/downvotes equivalent to saying in game:

 *""Theres a semi auto sniper on me, if anyone wants it.""*

I will write the pros of both the AR &amp; Burst. I will omit a cons list because one of the weapons pros may be the others cons and/or a pro may be better at a given action. Let's have a serious, unbiased discussion. 

AR; 

+Automatic

+Build dps/pressure

+Sniper followup

Reliable &amp; accurate at long range

Burst; 

+Player dps 90+/- damage per burst to body

+Shotgun followup

+Burst damage

The pump shotgun is favored over a tactical because of its ability to reward good aim with high damage. This allows a player to maintain their shield with deliberate actions thanks to the nature of burst damage. This gun could be classified as a **game changer** because it can turn a fight thats almost lost into a victory. The tactical leaves you vulnerable while dealing damage. It has a higher rate of fire &amp; a larger ammo count. At first, this may seem like a better choice for a 1v2+. Evidentally, **a weapon that deals high burst damage is a better choice in any outnumbered situation.** Dealing damage while maintaining health, *building*, is important.

What is not important in a outnumbered situation? Build dps. *Why?* Vulnerability. *Obligatory* Spraying builds leaves you vulnerable in a 1v1, too

Choosing player dps over build dps for a primary weapon is a obvious choice when there are many readily available weapons better at build dps at close/medium range.

*The primary function for some weapons **is** build dps*

The burst is a high skill weapon that is very powerful and underestimated by so many here. I hope you may see why I am puzzled so many favor the AR over the burst. I have not reached a final conclusion however I have an idea...

The DB is also a tad too strong in competitive play, but not terrible. But Grappler + DB? Absolutely ridiculous.","Title pretty much says it all. I disagree with the Grappler hate I'm seeing; it's counterable, people just have to get used to it a bit more. I think it should get 10 shots instead of 15, and maybe you should move a bit slower while the rope is retracting, but it's pretty neat. The Double Barrel is a bit more troubling, as it's probably the only gun in the game where if your enemy has it, and you don't (within 2 tiles of each other), you're a goner. But, it has strong weaknesses beyond the 2 tile range that make the Heavy the better option for many.

But there is a HUGE issue when they are both combined. The negatives of the DB are completely eradicated; you can just quickly zip over within 2 tiles of the person, hit them for 100+ twice, and then, if you're being third partied, you can just zip away. 2 bullets only in the DB becomes no problem, because you can just escape, reload and reset super easily. 

Even if they don't kill you, good players can zip up, shoot you for 100-150, miss the second bullet, and then zip away. Normally if they miss the 2nd bullet, they are in a spot of bother because they have to reload now, but nope; just zip away and now they have a massive health and positioning advantage. 

I think Epic really did not consider the synergy with these two items. Standalone, they are strong, but counterable and fun to use. Together? They are ridiculous and annoying. ",FortniteCompetitive

[This thread yesterday is a perfect example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9fai17/with_the_drum_gun_gone_it_seems_people_have_a_new/)

I made [my own comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9fai17/with_the_drum_gun_gone_it_seems_people_have_a_new/e5vavhh/) in reply to that thread which addressed most of the points made in the OP but felt like I was too late to the show and wish to engage in further discussion about it.

Before I get into it too much, there is one point I would like to make. This is the difference between an item being an overall positive addition to the game and an item that is not. For an item to be an overall positive addition to the game, I think it needs to meet some requirements. Firstly, every item in the game should have a **viable** counter of some sort. For nearly every situation in the game, building and positioning is the go-to counter. But building is also countered by spraying, explosives, C4, and better building/positioning. This is just one small example of the balance that should exist in Fortnite. Fun ≠ balanced guys.

I could go through each item in the game (excluding the DB and Grappler) and come up with the role the item fills as well as the viable counter-plays that can be made against it. However, in the spirit of saving your time and my own, I will just make my argument for why the Grappler and DB do not fall into this category like other items in the game.

I'll start with the Grappler. When it comes right down to it, the Grappler is essentially 15 extremely accurate and nearly instant impulse nades. The only thing impulse nades can do that the Grappler cannot is move other players but this is such a small benefit that it becomes nearly irrelevant. The Grappler is by far the most powerful movement based item to have existed in Fortnite, even more than the Jetpack. The Jetpack had slow and awkward movement which left you very vulnerable during flight. This allowed players enough time to react to your Jetpack and build/get a shot at you before you were able to land and build. This is not the case with the Grappler. The Grappler lets to select exactly where you want to go on someone's high ground and gets you there in less than second after clicking. The time and ability to counter someone using a Grappler is smaller than any other item in the game. Outplaying is possible but I think the Grappler makes it too difficult and I am more than confident it will be reworked soon. A rework I would like to see is a 25-50% decrease in Grapple time and a 5-10 shot reduction. I hope Epic does not just make them more rare because that just makes the RNG element of the game even worse. It's just a bandage over a more serious issue, similarly to shotgun switching now in my opinion.

This brings me to the DB. The DB's obvious strength is it's ability to one-shot anyone in the same 1x1 as you with the obvious disadvantage of only having two shots and only being effective very close. In public matches of Fortnite, the DB is not nearly as punishing because it's less common for players to get close enough for the DB to be effective (before Grapplers at least). This is not true in competitive Fortnite however. The DB feeds off of the end game meta so well because there are many players in a very small circle. If you've watched scrims lately there is no way you haven't noticed how overly punishing the DB is. Even in public matches though. The DB's synergy with the Grappler is nutty. It is fun as all hell to Grapple up to someone and click them once for 150+ damage. But back to my original point about items in this game having **viable** counter-plays. I just do not see there being any counter-play that is viable enough to survive against a decent player using a Grappler + DB. There is not enough time to react and the damage you take from a single DB shot is simply too punishing. Forcing a close-range fight required to be effective with a DB should be a huge risk/reward decision. Right now, the risk is nearly completely diminished as long as you hit the massive spread and build around the person you surely just knocked. This will most of the time let you finish them and reload your DB before fighting the next person, negating the disadvantages of the DB entirely.

The way it stands, Fortnite would be in an overall more balanced and enjoyable state with the removal of the DB and Grappler (a rework might also help).

I'll say it one last time, **fun ≠ balanced**.

If anyone would like to try to convince me otherwise I would love to engage in a discussion about it.

Thanks!",FortniteCompetitive

I currently play at 1440x1080 and I personally love how it makes building look shorter and fatter which is great for 90-degree turns. However, there’s just a few questions I have that I couldn’t find answers for online.

1.) I have my config set to read only. Does this mean I can’t change keybinds without having to mess with the config?

2.) Do I have to make my desktop stretched to make the game stretched? Or can I make my desktop 1080p and only my game stretched.

3.) If I wanted to go back to a normal resolution, is it as simple as deleting the config and then verifying game files?

Some of those things are inherently not OP (double barrel? Seriously guys?). Others are powerful, yes, but like hop rocks and rifts, the community will adapt. This is the case with the grappler. It takes time for the community to adapt to new items and find out how to counter these things. It took a couple of weeks for hop rocks to level out and feel “normal” again.

There have been legitimate OP concerns, namely drum gun. Stop tagging items as “OP” when they are not, it cheapens the value of the term when we will need to use it for legitimate problems in the future. It also makes this sub look like a cesspool of whining. ",FortniteCompetitive

As my thoughts went a bit off topic in that particular thread, here's some further elaboration and food for thought. I have no PhD in psychology but some common sense and my measly quater century of inhabiting this planet and holding a mouse as soon as I was able to, will have to do the trick aswell I suppose.

So when you have the time, grinding matches for 16h straight must be ideal, right?
**Not, really.**

A lot of professional athletes do not train 12-16 hours a day, as a gamer could easily spent grinding. I think most people associate that with the athlete's physical limitations i.e. his body requiring rest. But guess what, just because a gamer doesn't do physical excersice during his grind, it does not mean it is not tiring for him/her aswell. 

Focusing your brain on high level gameplay for an extended duration is just as exhausting. Taking breaks and doing physical exercise can help to put your mind off the game and help you relax. Especially getting a good night's sleep is very healthy and a good base to being able to focus on the following day aswell. 

Non-gamer people use sports and exercise as a meditative activity where they stop thinking (and worrying) about stressful things like work, family, a.s.o. For (aspiring professional or not) gamers, this works just as fine though. During the work-out or, paraphrased, downtime activity, it is important for your brain to not think about the game.
For example, leave your phone and get off reddit while eating aswell, as it only keeps your brain stagnant and focused, while your body is all.sorts of busy with digesting. 

Same principle applies before sleeping, some people like to watch streamers before sleeping. This still occupies your brain with the game and keeps it active. Ideally, you want yourself to relax and chill a bit before attempting to sleep. Watch something not associated with the game instead. If you want to watch streamers, do it actively. Watch players like poach and study their gameplay. Or listen to educational streamers explaining their every move. 

**For a highly competitive watcher, watching ""casually entertaining"" pubstompers can lead to adopting some of their bad habits.** 

Styling on bots for no reason, sloppy play where unnecessary damage was taken, slow builds/edits, or dropping for 50/50s is what a lot of them do just because they know their aim will carry them 8/10 times. But that's not what a truly competitive player wants. You want to adopt smart strategies and clean plays that carry you 99/100 times.

So the takeaway here is, you need to balance your day out. Having a well regulated daily schedule with set times is very beneficial to you and can reduce having off-days.

With the vault of the Tommy Gun, the double barrel has had its biggest counter removed. On top of that, the grappler/double barrel combo is generally pretty OP.

So, why is double shotgun any better?

First off, double shotgun is *easily* accessible. Everyone can get it at pretty much any time throughout the game. There is not as much RNG in double shotgun as there is in finding a double barrel, as pumps and tacs are both extremely common floor loot.

Second off, in any state, it still takes double shotgun far longer to get off two shots than it takes the double barreled to. Granted, this is followed by the long reload for the double barrel, but more often than not the reload comes after you are already dead, shredded from full HP in under a second.

Third and last, double shotgun + grappler would require 3 slots instead of 2. It would be a very large sacrifice to make as you could really only carry an AR and meds, but no splodes, sniper, or other utility. While giving up 2 slots for double barrel and grappler is still sacrificing an extra slot for close range, the grappler has so many uses that it is more than justified.

When I'm playing well, I can win 4/5 solo games with 10+ kills each time and there's rarely a fight where I feel challenged. This isn't one good night of gameplay, I can go a week of gameplay playing this consistently well and feel like I've finally turned a corner in terms of improvement. To put it into context, I had a 21% win rate last season in solos and was aiming for 30% this season (while still playing normally - landing tilted most games). 


I started off this season able to hold around that for about 150 solo games, I added a new paddle to my controller (mapped to B) and accepted I'd play worse for a while and as a result my stats would drop. No problem. They went down to about 23% win before I started getting the hang of using the other paddle.

Fast forward a month and I'm playing the best Fortnite I've played, winning games with ease. Making it out of tilted basically every game pushing every gunfight. Then, last week, coincidentally after the patch hits, and all of a sudden I'm playing terribly. The game feels different, hand doesn't feel right on the controller. Finding myself moving paddles on my controller around, adjusting my sensitivity, just trying to find the answer. My win % has actually now dropped to 20%, lower than it was last season. 

I've always been a inconsistent player and it's annoying af. It always seems to be one week on, one week off in terms of performance. How do I get some consistency? Or is being inconsistent part of being an above average but not quite top tier player?

I had 4 wins in 8 games and thought I was some hot shit. I then went on what I think was the longest streak of being bad I've ever had. I choked about 60 solo games in a row. My mental game was shambles. I'd play really well in Duos and squads then do some solos and shit the bed. 

At the very end of that season I finally got 3 wins in a row and I called my season over at that point. It felt good. Really good. I started playing for wins, because I think I fight pretty well, enough to get through any pub game, I changed some keybinds and stuck with 3 routes (Fatal, the bridge by paradise, and motel) and my win percentage has gone up, my confidence has gone up, and I really haven't played that many games at all. I'm really happy that despite my smaller playtime how much I could improve at this game.

The comments are straight circle jerking each other and it seems like y’all have already found the next thing to complain about.

The Grappler is a fun item and makes for some really slick plays. Can you get high ground with it easily? Yes! Is it OP like the jet pack that could completely negate fall damage? Certainly not. 

It feels like people would rather complain about shit than change the way they play as new items rollout. If someone keeps taking high ground from you with a grappler.... disengage and fight them on the low ground! 

Trying to outbuild someone who can ‘steal’ your high ground is just a losing battle. Play differently. Carry disengage tools (impulses, bouncers) or place traps on your high ground.

The grappler and double barrel have great synergy together but it takes up two slots and is only effective at point blank range. You’re taking up two slots just to be able to fight someone in melee range... 

The Grappler isn’t OP.... it’s a cool mobility item and nothing else. Change my mind!",FortniteCompetitive

Having a clear and consistent format for a competitive eSport title is absolutely paramount, in my opinion. Some of the most popular eSport titles rules and win conditions can be summarised in a single sentence:

League of Legends: you win by destroying the enemies base (nexus)
CS:GO: you win by killing the other team and/or successfully planting/defusing a bomb
Overwatch: you win by being the first team to reach 100 points (KOTH). You win by pushing the payload the furthest (Payload maps)

Whereas it isn’t so straightforward for Fortnite, at least at the competitive scene. It is far too simplistic to say you win by being the last solo/duo/squad standing as you can... also earn an arbitrary amount of points for placing in the top X. Oh, and if you get over Y kills then you earn 3 points and over Z it’s 5 points. But don’t forget the Royale Flush can be multiplied by the WRECKING BALL bonus and an additional points if KING PING was activated in the previous game. 

My point is that the Fortnite point system can be particularly confusing. 

This isn’t something that I’ve seen discussed much on this subreddit, but, High Stakes is the first time we’ve seen an objective based mode in Fortnite. The concept is fairly simple and it might be cool to see how squads or duos of pro players would pan out. ",FortniteCompetitive

Your hops are enhanced in distance, basically it is faster than running. Unfortunately, the placement of the hop rocks were questionable since the majority of it were in the middle of the map (Dusty Divot), meaning most of it were mostly used for combat, few on mobility.


---


Season 4, we are introduced with **Shopping Cart**, the first form of vehicle in the game that allows 1 or 2 players to be more faster than running. Scattered around the area, the Shopping Cart was the reason some of you survived that final tick of the storm. Unfortunately, it has its moment of game breaking bug. 


---

Season 5, this season offers the best transportation throughout the map so far. Not only we get a better vehicle (which is the **ATK**), we have the **Rifts**, basically a better version of the Launch Pad.

Although it may spawn by luck, unlike the Hop Rocks, MOST of it are spawned at the edge of the map so players who lands there have a chance to survive the storm.



---


For the upcoming Season 6, we have been teased a new kind of 'mobility', which is the **Zero Gravity Field**. Created by the Cube, it is placed on certain location that allows player to seemingly float within that field. This form of mobility is almost similar to the Hop Rocks but slower. However, a boost from an Impulse or a Shockwave grenade will be amplified tremendously. Within that radius, fall damage is negated. However, once you exit the radius, fall damage will be introduced again.

-

Now, what I'm worried is how the ZGF is going to be later on. The current state of the ZGF is very disappointing. It's too slow and going inside of it can sometimes be considered as a risk. Many of my games that I have played, I would always try to avoid going inside of it. Apparently, the design of it seems to be going towards combat type advantage, to negate fall damage and jump higher, just like the hop rock...*but worse.* The mobility usage of it is significantly small. Once you are out of the ZGF, it has already offered its existence, which is just the no fall damage zone. Only players who have Launch/Bouncer pad or Impulse/Shockwave grenade will be rewarded when used inside the zone. This means the ZGF doesn't provide that much function to the game.

---


**TL;DR: Zero Gravity Field (ZGF) is shit. We hope its current state is not going to be like that throughout Season 6.**

So my suggestion is to heal back some HP/Shield after you getting a kill. For example - you geting back 30% of DMG you dealt to the killed player, or simply some flat number, like get a kill got 50 hp (or shield if you full hp).  


So you can instantly go to another fight after you just killed someone, plus it will encourage agressive playstyle since yo can save your pots if you killing lot of people.

336,Redbluegreenx,1536718865,9f3s7m,27,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9f3s7m/people_misunderstand_trn/,19,People misunderstand TRN,"TRN doesn't work if you play 500+ games a month.  After about 300+ games, if you are good and try hard every game (less likely) you should be 4900.  The system works, but not under conditions where it wasn't meant to e.g. playing 700 games a season.  The system was designed so there was another way to compare skill besides just saying flat wins or KD.

TRN + matchmaking (with a bit more favorable points gained/points lost margins in order to get 50% win/loss in each game) would be the foundation of a great ranked system.  TRN is currently abused by people who just camp top 10 in pubs every game for the 1 point (at higher levels) you get for that and the fact that you can always do this because there is no matchmaking.  If there was matchmaking, everyone playing for top 10 -&gt; competitive game that looks a lot like high level games should look.

Pros TRN is often not that high because they are consistently playing snipes rather than just grinding pub matches for placements, so that's why a lot of unknowns may have very high TRN ratings.

A high TRN doesn't guarantee your an amazing top X player (nothing until consistent ranked queue and open tournaments can help rank players as much as this sub would like to), but it is hard to get a high TRN if you are a bad player in under a couple hundred games.  Using TRN rating is a generally good indicator (so for selecting a smaller group of players out of a much larger group of players), but comparing a 49xx with another 49xx is really not going to do anything.  There are no current metrics to compare players accurately because there is no matchmaking (hopefully resolved in 2 weeks or so with S6).

tl;dr TRN would work really well if matchmaking was based on TRN (with some adjustments to make it less punishing), TRN currently doesn't work because it doesn't have matchmaking and doesn't function when people play too many games due to the impossibility of creating a 50/50 system (due to no matchmaking again)",FortniteCompetitive

But as we can remember, the state of the game was then compromised by the inflation of adding new weapons which included the drum gun, SMG and compact SMG and this is what created the spray meta. Now that almost an entire season has passed, we have resolved this issue by nerfing the SMG and compact SMG, and vaulting the drum gun but it's important that both Epic and the community learn from this experience.

New players or experienced players, please stop ignoring utility in fortnite !

C4, stinkers, clingers, nades and such are all great items and are super useful in your loadout.

Utility items in fortnite are great for resetting fights or forcing your opponent to move. Since you are the one controlling where and when to use the utility it will 9/10 give you the upper hand because you can capitalize first !

Ex. In a solos you spot a player and you both start building head on. The enemy places a ramp over you head, does a 180 and builds a 1x1 to look down on you and take shots. In a situation like this you can drop and throw a stinker in at his box forcing him to move. You then either shoot out or double ramp to attempt to retake height.

In conclusion try using some of the utility items in fortnite, they are great for resetting fights and make it very easy to capitalize on your opponents mistakes. They are also awesome for retakes on height or forcing your opponent to make a move !

So players, try out using some of the utility items in your solos and see how it works for you.

Best of luck",FortniteCompetitive

The amount of times I have seen people post ""damn my KD"" or ""how do you get this KD""  or ""how can I get from a 3 to a 6+ KD?"" is funny.

*Many* of you associate getting better with KD and you're already going in with the mindset of being bad.  A number will not make you good.  Whenever you find your mistakes and improve whether it be a day or a month is when you *get good* and your KD will *naturally* increase.

Your KD doesn't mean anything.  If your shot sucks, if your decision making on gunfights suck, if your building sucks, if how you hold highground sucks, if your rotations suck, if your mechanics suck.  You fix it.  The more mistakes you fix.  The better you become.  The better you become overall.  The less you die.

Apply yourself when you play and notice your mistakes -&gt; Fix your mistakes. -&gt; Become better. -&gt; Naturally die less. -&gt; KD naturally increases.  

*Your building cleanliness, the speed you do it at, your aim, rotations and situational awareness etc...*

Focus on those 5 things and see specifically what *HINDERS* you from doing them better than others.  You have a shitty setup?  Bad mousepad?  Or are you just slow and don't want to put energy into whipping your mouse to build faster and hit flicks?  It can be anything.

Also, you could be the guy who is the most PASSIVE player ever and is afraid to take an engagement and drops Junk Junction every single game to try to hold your KD.  That is a strategy.  But you're not truly improving.

*There are times to be aggressive and times to be passive and if you drop in those places every game and NEVER aggress intentionally and only fight when engaged on you will not improve.  You need to know when to apply aggression and when to be passive there are times for both.",FortniteCompetitive

Something I used every game during solid golds was heavy famas and it seemed both fun and viable. Now I’ve been trying the dualies in place of famas as a swap weapon since I see them every game and I’m mostly undecided on how I feel about them. They can do over 150 with 2 headshots yes, but a burst can do the same with 2 headshots and a body shot. The time from first bullet to last bullet seems negligibly different between the 2. Also, a famas can 1 shot a new wood structure while dualies fall short by 5-10 damage. With heavy into famas I shoot once with each then back to heavy, With dualies would it be better to mostly keep them out for at least 2 bursts? If not, I feel famas is always just a better version of dual pistols unless I’m missing something. Would love if anyone could convince me to use dualies in a load out since they’re super fun but I feel like the famas does the burst part harder and smgs reliably dps/finish low hp enemies better.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm asking that question cause I really don't see how I can get the player out of his little box if hes pretty decent. Also I'm using turtleing myself and well - it's very easy to be safe in your little 1x1 I can turtle for minutes, so asmy opponent if he good enough and usually the one who trying to get trought turtle dies, that just retarded as fuck.  


Few examples of what I'm trying to do:

First, I'm never trying to shoot his box from above if I see that he know about roofs, cause it really won't do anything since he will just place floor + roof above 24/7 him and you won't do any dmg trought 2 layers.

I'm usually trying to randomly run around his box and shoot down all the walls or pickaxe it and trying to replace, well as I've already told if the enemy any decent he'll just hold autobuild and will track you movements so you won't ever replace his walls. 

And usually it ends up one way - he edits on you while you reloading your spray gun, or pickaxing his wall and get a shootgun shoot - than you dead.  


  
It really became the problem for me lately when I meet some decent plaer I just can't do anything if hes turtling. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example -  just played a game where we left 1 v 1 with the last guy, I've actually saw he just fought with somebody so I rushed him cause I was pretty sure hes low - he boxed himself and started to pop minis so I started to spam/pickaxing his walls and trying to replace it, but every time I was trying to destroy his walls he was going build mode and holding autobuild, then w8ting till I stop or reload and trying to pop minis again - so it was going on for like 2 minutes and eventually he poped 2 minis lel, then while I still tried to spam his walls down he fast edited and made a good pump shoot on me so I was left with 50 hp - well, I'm instantly boxed myself too and started to heal, so now it's him who was trying to get into my box, but I just made same as him turtling and healing, but sad thing is I only had bandages so I only made it to 75 hp, then I fast edited at him, made a pump shot and died from his pump shot since I was 75 hp.  


That whole fight was going for like 3-4 minutes and we both were able to use all the heals we had, so I just find that retarded - I can't get to his box, he can't get to mine, so pretty much who has more heals win xD.

From a business standpoint, it makes sense to have counters to building so that a person who just picked up the game can stand a chance against a pro and therefore play the game more and spend more money on cosmetics. From the standpoint of the players that Epic is giving massive payments to, it makes no sense to have ""counters"" to the only thing that separates Fortnite from PUBG or any of the other hundred plus battle royale games. It'd be like if Capcom nerfed Fireballs in Street Fighter because new players aren't able to deal with them. Capcom's viewpoint on that is ""Learn to deal with it or shut up."" Epic is being a pushover in comparison. Think of all of the things in this game we have to lessen the need to learn Fortnite's core mechanic. You have the grappling gun to shoot up to people camping and instantly get high ground. We have the shockwave grenade which shoots you miles wherever you want to go. We have 50 round weapons that simply melt through what you want to build. We have a sniper that instantly breaks your structure, allowing you to use that and switch to your 50 round drum gun and hold forward. I think Epic's attitude needs to change from ""You don't want to build? That's fine"" to ""You don't want to build? Sucks. Learn.""

If you’ve used shotguns at all, you’ll notice that the delay happens if you shotgun - build - try to shotgun again, or switch weapons. For example, if you pump someone, build a wall and quickly edit it, you’ll have to wait another second to shoot again. I personally find the delay very frustrating to have to work around and i have to play more slow to combat it. My thoughts would be to have the delay on one shotgun be the fire rate of the shotgun, so no matter all the switching or building you do, you can shoot your pump at it’s normal fire rate if you understand what i mean. Also, the delay is much much worse when using the double barrel as the double barrel has a very fast fire rate, and when editing / switching / building the delay completely obliterates one of the weapons main strengths. So yea, tl:dr the single shotgun delay imo is stupid, forces you to play slow, and lowers the building and editing skill gap. (edit especially)

I was winning every 5-6 solo games, even though I didn't play solo's every day, and I could out-build most people, and even give people clearly better than me a run for their money. If I didn't die at the start, I was good for 7-8 kills per game at least. 

But ever since about week 5 or 6 of this season, I've just realised that I'm not good at all. I have definitely gotten better in the last month and a half; I started using pyramids to block people, my building is quicker, my decision making based on more experience than ever before; but I get destroyed in the top 10 of every single game now. Whether it's an intense build battle that I lose, or if I get third partied after barely winning a fight, I just always die. I haven't won a solo in ages. I just feel *trash*.

I practiced in playgrounds, I looked at my replays to see my stupid mistakes, but apparently I just keep making them. If a player is above average, I just lose to them now. Everyone is insane. I feel like everyone has improved 10 times as fast as I have in the last month-ish. Even at the very start of games, where I used to be able to almost always survive to make it out of Tilted / Retail, now I struggle. I just get annihilated. 

Some deaths are annoying as hell; insta-clicked by a guy you couldn't hear with a double barrel, sprayed at from two angles by two Drum Gun players who both decide to focus you, sniper headshot while you're mid air by a guy with 2 kills... How frustrating is the feeling of dying to this? Well, I feel this on *every death*. I know I should be better, but I'm just not good enough. And since there is still no competitive ranked playlist, it's not like I can reset by joining a casual match and get back into the swing of things by practicing on new players.

THAT is what a competitive sub should look like.

It might feel bad to be critiqued but when you are signed to a team specifically to play a game professionally you should be subject to a conversation regarding your placement, skill, and your team whether good or bad. I sincerely hope the rules stop reflecting this idea that players should not be discussed and that the mood on this sub changes to one that actually reflects a competitve environment where players can be critiqued.


I know it’s probably not formatted super well because i’m on mobile but i’m open to discussion regarding this and hearing why people think players should not be under critique if that’s how you feel. ",FortniteCompetitive

PS4.  My K/D isn't great (it's between 2-3), but that's because I throw away ALOT of games just practicing stuff or playing with friends and dicking around ( I don't use playground mode).  When I'm in the zone and really putting forth the effort I'm probably more a 4-5 K/D player.  But I want to talk console sensitivity with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, this is moot once they make separate building sensitivity.  But until that time, I really think some of you guys are playing on too high a sensitivity.  

&amp;#x200B;

Any time there is sensitivity talk in here in seems like everyone is 8 or above.  I'm sure there are some young gods out there who shred just fine at these high sensitivities but this is for the majority of you just doing it bc everyone else does it.  I sit at 6-6 right now.  I've spent months at higher sensitivies, so I've tested this stuff out.  And what I've noticed as I come into my first full year playing is my aim is starting to get really good.  It's been a slow grind, but especially the last few months I feel as though I'm completely in control of my aim whether it's a hectic point-blank shotgun battle or long range AR.  It has taken a long time and thousands of games, but it's really getting there.  I think some of you guys who are all about building are doing yourselves a disservice by totally sacrificing aim practice.  Aim takes a long time to get gud at!!  

&amp;#x200B;

As console players we have to just accept our limitations.  I'm no slouch when it comes to building but I concede that there are times I run into players who can get up to the high-ground faster than me bc of the limitations of 6-6 sensitivity.  But you know what, that's fine.  First of all, I can usually laser these guys for some good damage before they get up there bc all they worry about is winning high ground.  Second of all, once I realize I'm up against a high sensitivity building beast I just let him get over me and play the mid/low ground game.  He's going to have to expose himself eventually, and when he does I'm sure that 90% of the time I have the gunplay advantage because of my sensitivity.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is long, but my point is that we are NOT PC players.  Building is super important, I don't want this to come off as anti-building but I think the optimal way to play on console right now is around a 6 or 7 sensitivity which allows you to hit shots while still building at a respectable pace.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is not going to be for everyone.   But for those of you who are unsure or who are currently at high-sensitivities and deep down you know something is off... try to re-commit to a 6 or 7.  When Epic finally makes separate building sensitivity I think the players who have been mastering 6 or 7 sensitivity aim are going to have an advantage over the others.  Building might be flashier, but good aim takes longer to master.",FortniteCompetitive

But this is not true because I can hold both pump/smg and a double barrel as well. I just use pump/smg like normal, but any time I know I can get in a 1x1 space with the enemy (or they're about to get into my 1x1 space) I take out the double barrel and I get an absolute guaranteed kill with 0 chance of counterplay or mistake by myself because it's almost impossible to miss due to the big spread.

The ONLY time I don't get a free kill on an enemy like this is if they also have a double barrel and they shoot me before I do. 

This is why the double barrel is broken and needs to be vaulted (even if you nerf it in any way that makes it good it will be useless anyways). 

No gun in this game comes down to a ""if I have one and he doesn't, I am guaranteed to win"" because everything including drum, rpg, etc can be played around because you can shoot them before they shoot you, shoot and build, etc. 

Getting into someone's 1x1 space or them getting into yours is inevitable if you or the other guy wants to make it happen. And at that point the only play/counterplay left is aim. If I have a double barrel and you don't, it doesn't matter how perfect your aim is, I'm going to kill you. 

Another point against double barrel is that it doesn't need to exist. It doesn't add anything to the game. It doesn't prevent turtling (if anything it encourages it), it doesn't promote aggressive play (because if they have one you have to play a lot more careful), and the quality of the game would not decrease if it wasn't in the game. 

I would have absolutely nothing against it if it was as common to find as pumps, because then everyone can always have one. But as it currently is, when I get one I know the person I'm fighting against likely doesn't and it becomes an ""I WIN"" button as soon as we get into a committed gun fight in the same 1x1 space even if he got the first shots on me and had perfect aim.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much everybody in the comments seemed to be unanimous that late season 4 was the most balanced the game has been yet and I agree with that.

&amp;#x200B;

However I would like to point out that we are very close to a balanced meta right now. In my opinion after the fiasco, that was the launch of the compact smg, Epic finally realised that they had gone too far. I feel like every patch after that has been gradually moving the game towards a healthier state.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my current opinions on all of the weapons in the game and what could/should still be improved upon:

&amp;#x200B;

**ARs**: 

The most resent patch brought the much needed buffs to the burst rifles and now they are finally viable. Automatic rifles are fine IMO. Nobody likes bloom but I honestly can't see Epic making any adjustments to it because they seem to be content with just FSA.

&amp;#x200B;

**SMGs**: 

I honestly think that all of the SMGs that use light bullets are balanced right now. They are right where they should be. BUT... the drum gun needs to go. Even if they were to nerf it a little bit it would still get picked over the other SMGs. Because of the fact that it uses medium bullets, it wouldn't make sense for the damage to be the same or less than the other SMGs. If they were to nerf it more and possible reduce the clip size it just becomes a reskin of the compact smg. And if they nerf it to smithereens then what's the point?

&amp;#x200B;

It. Simply. Doesn't. Fit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shotguns**: 

Oh, what a controversial topic :) 

I'm just going to jump right in and say what I personally think. The heavy is just fine, pump and tac are underperforming. The way I see it, there are two ways to fix this.

&amp;#x200B;

A) Buff them (more damage, less spread)

&amp;#x200B;

B) Allow us to double shotgun again

&amp;#x200B;

I would be fine with either one of these but to be honest I think that option A is the boring one and option B is the exciting one. With option A players' loadouts and close quarters playstyles will largely remain the same: ""pop a couple shots with a shotgun and finish with either SMG or AR"". At the same time single shotgun vs. single SMG fights would be more balanced. However if it wasn't clear enough, option B brings back a whole different playstyle. I firmly believe that in the current state of the game double shotgun would not be overpowered at all. With how good the SMGs are now, if you don't hit your shots with double shotgun you're done. I remember when Epic made a state of development post where they basically said that they want to promote different playstyles, so that the game wouldn't boil down to just one. Ironically, this was just before they removed double shotgun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah...

&amp;#x200B;

**Snipers**: 

They're just fine. Well, I do have one nitpick and that is the heavy sniper's body damage. I don't think that it should one shot you (to the body) after you've drunk two mini shields or a big pot. One shotting structures is fine and it should hit harder than the bolt but maybe bring it down to like 140?

&amp;#x200B;

Over all, not a big deal. Sniping does take a lot skill and this change isn't going to make or break the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Splodes**: 

Splodes are in a good state over all. The rocket cap, clinger nerf and C4 stack size nerf have been great improvements but I have a couple of suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make C4 drop in stacks of 2 and cap C4 at 4

&amp;#x200B;

2. Add damage falloff to all splodes, so you take less damage at the edge of the explosion than at the very center

&amp;#x200B;

3. Just let the guided missile go already

&amp;#x200B;

I still think that it is too easy to kill someone with C4 and having less at your disposal would make you think more about when and where you want to use it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second point has been suggested a couple times now and it just makes sense. I mean that' s how the splodes should work, period.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the third point I think that the guided missile is a useless gimmick and doesn't surve any real purpose + apparently it doesn't even work right now (it keeps firing backwards). The only way that it could work is, if it was just a recon drone with like thermal vision or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick sum up of all the pistols**:

&amp;#x200B;

Deagle: 

The damage drop off should be reduced but not to an extent where it becomes a hit scan hunting rifle.

&amp;#x200B;

Dual pistols: 

Currently the most RNG weapon in the game. Either you delete someone or you don't hit them at all. I would reduce the damage or the headshot multiplier.

&amp;#x200B;

Pistols &amp; Silenced pistols: 

Why would you ever choose a pistol over an SMG? Yeah, you wouldn't. That being said I do have a suggestion that might make even pistols a viable option:

&amp;#x200B;

Make pistols 100% accurate when ADSing. So they would basically have the FSA reticle all the time. Just imagine how satisfying it would be if you actually got rewarded for great aim. The damage drop off would need to be increased so that they didn't become substitutes for ARs or anything but over all I feel like it could work.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think about my list? Do you agree with everything or disagree with something? Is there something you would like to add? 

&amp;#x200B;

I put a lot of effort in to this post and would love to generate some real conversation around it.",FortniteCompetitive

Games with the drum gun:

I am currently putting all my time into Fortnite in hope of esports competition. But so far, it's more like hall of fame competition rather than ""esports"", both by EPIC and 3rd party organizers. It's always YouTuber/Streamer contents and there is literally not a single competition that you can join without being a Youtuber, or streamer. Do we really have to start streaming?

&amp;#x200B;

Epic is doing great and i know it takes marketing and bla bla to reach more people and same goes for 3rd parties that's focusing on views not esports to make money from sponsors **AND ITS OKAY** for them but when it comes to Epic, i think we should have something at least like Showdowns while we're waiting for World Cup thing because its Epic Games, it's their own game and they're not struggling on income. Because i know i'm not the only one that started losing their hope slowly.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic, give us something to be busy with. No matter how much/or even you open the pocket for that. Normal games are not feeling like a competition and lack of rewarding. And Scrims(which is also 3rd party) are not something that we can solve this.",FortniteCompetitive

However, a player with 40% win is very likely better than someone with a 5 or 10% win. Until now.   
Making a game mode like The Getaway count stats is a shocking decision to me. I played 3 games of squads with one friend, no fill, and easily won two. Then I played the duo version alone, no fill and won 4 in a row.   


I can't be the only one who feels like this completely undermines what I worked on for the past 6-7 months, improving, raising my KPG and win-rates.

It created a weapon that rewarded accuracy at the boundary of short to medium range and was balanced by its inability to spray at close range due to its fire rate.

Both shotguns and the Tactical SMG was effective at close range and you weren't forced to use both weapons. People had preference of what shotgun and SMG they would use and the SMG's were effective against enemies without the ability of spraying through structures so easily.

Only thing that could have made this state better was if the uniform shotgun pellet adjustment was introduced earlier along with the shotgun delay with the tactical SMG added in the weapon pool for the delay.

Then it all went downhill in the following updates with the addition of the drum gun, double barrel, SMG, compact SMG, nerf to the silenced SMG and wood max health reduction which created the spray meta.

This is just my personal opinion of the game's best state, what point do you guys think the game was most balanced?",FortniteCompetitive

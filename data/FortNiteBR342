People made it seem like this thing was ridiculously hard to counter, literally all you have to do is build a one\-by\-one structure with a roof and you'll take no damage from it; to me the Guided was well balanced in solos and duos considering it did no damage through materials, I could understand why people claimed it was overpowered in squads, but it wasn't the worst thing. It seemed that the community made it seem like the guided missile was just as common as the RPG claiming a squad could just bombard you with multiple guided missiles, however at least to me I rarely witnessed two of these things in the same game. 

  Really the only complaint that's reasonable is that it ruins the pace of the game. I agree with this and think Epic should put the Guided Missile back in BR but with a unique limited ammo type \(guided missiles\) that makes sure no one can spam it the entire end\-game.  I believe the Guided Missile was a very unique weapon that was tons of fun to use, while at the same time a little broken that could've been properly balanced for everyone to enjoy. What do you guys think? Should Epic put the Guided Missile back in BR with maybe limited ammo or a different nerf such as less travel distance? Should it merely never make a return? Or do you have other ideas? ",FortNiteBR

I have played about 30 games and just came first for the first time. I didn't kill anyone the whole match, I just hid in the edge of the map the entire time. Once i hit someone in the head but then they ran off. As the safe zone shrank I moved inwards, and basically did nothing until there were 6 people left. I shot someone but they ran away and i didn't pursue them. With a tiny space left and 6 people remaining, they seemed to have some kind of final battle in a mega structure that they had created. Two people survived who i think were on the same team but they got stuck in their own structure and were killed by the storm when they couldn't get out in time. So much to my surprise I won. 

I have only killed about 4 people total in all these games combined (all 30 games). I find coordinating my shooting extremely difficult so i end up getting into a fight, firing 25 rounds with the assault rifle, doing minimal damage and then they kill me.

Also loads of people seem to be in groups working together, but I can't seem to coordinate with the guys on my team. Possibly they think I am useless.

I have a few questions:

1) Is it normal to win without killing anyone? 

2) Is building structures important? Why? Doesn't it just show everyone where you are and make you a huge target?

3) Is hiding and hoping everyone kills each other and then fighting the final guy / girl 1v1 a good tactic?

4) Should i be coordinating with teammates? How?

5) How can i improve my chances of winning in 1v1 shootouts?

Thanks for explaining this to a clueless new player.

It’s my brother’s 16th birthday in two weeks, and he has wanted Fortnite (for xbox one) for as long as I can remember. So I thought, hey, I’d be a nice sister and get it for him - even if it costs an exorbitant amount. 

I haven’t played video games in a long time (due to uni), but I never played games with online components or microtransactions at all, so I’ve found myself very confused. And after doing some research I see the base game for fortnite is actually free, so what do I actually get him for his present? Do you have to pay for the season passes? Or do you just buy v-bucks to play? Also what is the difference in the ‘standard founders pack’/‘deluxe founders pack’ and is is worth it for someone just interested in battle royale? I do know you need live membership so I’ve got that covered, and I have an old Xbox 360 headset I’m assuming will be compatible with the Xbox one controller, but can buy another one if I need to.

So far I don't have any friends so I get matched with randos. Any tips for how to do well in squads? My team usually never follows me and sometimes they shoot me. They also sometimes have two band together, then they both die real fast.

My top questions are:

Which guns are really good and which aren't?

Is the build menu something better used in the midst of a fight, or is it far more useful when you make strategic defenses where you sit and camp with your sniper rifle?

What is the best thing to do at the start of a squads match with randoms, should I wait until they drop and aim where they are going? Should I focus more on avoiding enemy drop locations? should I abandon my team and drop where I feel is going to be better and then solo it out? What should I do if my team splits up?

Also, once you land, is it better to run around and find a weapon, or is it better to sit down and grab materials?

Lastly, are healing items supposed to be super rare, and you basically have to work with the health you have, or am I just very bad at finding things and using them well?",FortNiteBR

I think tactical and pump shotguns are overpowered due to their long effective range and tight spread. Using any other weapon at close to medium range feels sub\-optimal, it just isn't viable to use a sub machine gun against an opponent using a shotgun because they can instantly kill you starting at medium range with no tracking required. As the weapon does not require tracking, it is both extremely powerful and has a low skill requirement.

I think the tactical and pump shotguns should have their range reduced, and the spread increased. Hopefully this would make other weapons feel more viable at medium range and put the shotgun into a more niche position as a close range option.

I imagine there will be posts saying ""Just build lol"", but that shouldn't excuse the large power difference between the shotgun and other weapons.",FortNiteBR

Every single game today i died to a rocket launcher. It feels like everyone has one right now. 

Explosives are just ridiculous! Every single one does &gt;100 damage and it doesnt matter at all if you are inside the explosion or 5 meters away. Explosives are supposed to destroy buildings, not to kill players no matter what. Especially grenade launcher are a serious problem for the balance. 

I get that these weapons are made for the worst, so they have a chance against the rest, but this is just too much. In solos you can push the person with a grenade launcher or outbuild people with rocket launcher, but once the situation get sticky or you are playing Duos/Squads where you cant take care of every single grenade and person at all times you are fucked. In the endgame every team will have &gt;30 rockets and with one person spamming rockets/grenades at all times and 1 or two people shooting you with rifles there is absolutely no chance to win against medium/experienced players. 

Please EPIC, nerf explosive damage overall against players or add a damage system that scales with the distance of a player to the explosive. 

I love how this game scales with skill and I havent been playing anything else for a few month, buth this one thing is tilting me so bad, i considered changing. A lot of other experienced players I played with have the same opinion.

Please give me your opinion on this topic.

I will now vent about recent events that happened about 20 minutes ago. I was playing duos with a random person. As soon the bus let you jump, he jumped out, no marker, I don't even know where he went. I went to Junk Junction. I landed there last, somehow got a shotgun, knocked two people (different teams), killed one, found the other revivied, killed both, teammate died somewhere, around Pleasant, Haunted area. I went to Anarchy to get in circle and 1 team rushed me, i shotgunned one of them, then another team rushed as well. I shotgunned and killed one. The 1 surivior from each team were inside the barn, one killed one, eliminating the other team. I dropped into the barn and killed the guy. 
Rushing to the next circle again, i come across a team up close, we had a build battle, got high ground, knocked and finished one, killed the other which was looting his teammates spoils. 
Rushing to next circle again, I, again, come across another team. They were somewhat far away, but their scars could easily reach me. I kept building, but they kept shooting down my base over and over. i lasered one, got him to 30 health but he killed me with a shotgun.
I made it top 3 by myself. Just imagine what we could've if my teammate didn't die.
I know what y'all are going to say. ""Oh, but everyone will be the same skill level, everyone will be good and winning will be less frequent."" I don't care. I rather have a fair fight every game with a 50/50 chance I win or lose than a fight that's not fair and has too many variables that decides if I win or lose. And here is some tips not to be a b****
Hey, don't edit yourself into my 1x1 base, use the mats you got from the guy I killed that you looted and build one yourself. 
If you are new to this game, please play duos, don't ruin the game for other people.

Seriously, all of their writing prompts somehow turn into Fortnite. One of them is preparing a speech on Fortnite and its popularity. These kids mean the world to me, so I downloaded Fortnite in hopes of understanding what they were going on about. I ended up getting addicted to the game. 

The problem is that I suck at it. I consistently come in top\-15 in solos but solely due to camping. I can't hit a moving target. I can't build. I'm just Bad lol. I've been playing with a trackpad from the beginning, but I'm about to get a mouse since I've been told part of my problem might be that I play on the trackpad. However, I used my housemate's mouse to play the other night and it felt so clumsy and awkward. Somehow, I'm better with a trackpad than a mouse. 

I love Fortnite the way that I play it now, but I'd like to be able to get in on the action. I wanna drop at Tilted and not die instantly every once in a while. So if there's anyone that would like to play with me, either duos or squads or whatever, once I get a mouse and give me pointers on how to become a better play, I would greatly appreciate it!!!

Also, even if you don't want to play with me, which I totally understand because you'd have to carry me 99.9999999999&amp;#37; of the time, if you have any tips or tricks you want to let me know, just leave them in the comments. Thanks, everybody!",FortNiteBR

my team and me are presenting our Fortnite Challenge Website. We've invested a lot of money and time creating our website, providing Fortnite players fun and competitive challenges with, most importantly, a lot of rewards.

You guys will be able to have a go at our challenges which will be released weekly / daily depending on the difficulty and when a winning submission has been submitted. We don't have a lot of rules, no teaming, no exploits and no cheats are allowed, the Gameplay needs to be achieved after our challenge went live. We require your replay to verify your win. Our team will check the footage and also a secret method to avoid fraud. We will check the date when the gameplay has been recorded. Everything else will be listed on the challenge itself.

You can win money, hardware and more. Currently there are cash rewards and the Razer Electra V2 Gaming Headset up for grabs for both PC and Console Players. Special thanks to Razer who hooked us up.

The current iteration of the Website was created by a friend of mine (/u/pka_challengegg) due to time constraints from my side. It is very rudimental and merely a draft of what is possible. In the future I'll work to craft a fully custom website to provide a much better integration and more features if it turns out to be well received.

You guys can check out our Website at https://challenge.gg Reminder: We are launching as a BETA, if you face any issues while browsing our website please contact us at admin@challenge.gg

If you have any questions feel free to ask them here, we will answer everything!

I want to thank everyone who is working with us right now, we are providing everything out of our own pockets to offer a fun environment with no ads.

We will try our best to make this project a fun experience.

GOOD LUCK!

&amp;nbsp;

•With the start of season 4, the main hype was around the meteor. But along with the meteor, movie sets appeared. I don't see much link between a meteor and a movie set but maybe it's nothing... This theory is based on this point in that this season is all basically a 'film' and we're running around the sets etc.

&amp;nbsp;

•After completing the #1 blockbuster challenge and receiving the loading screen, the description is as follows: ""Directors Notes: He was finally puckering up when it all came crashing down..."" In the background of the image you can see a meteor hitting the prison, almost as if the meteor there is part of a movie scene. My idea about this was that after more blockbuster challenges are unlocked, more things are revealed and we may just find out the truth about the meteor.

&amp;nbsp;

•The opening cinematic for season 4 is a movie trailer, saying things such as ""The World will never be the same!"" in a typical narrator voice. Rewatch the opening cinematic with this theory in mind and tell me it doesn't hint at the season being a film.

&amp;nbsp;

•There are green-screens everywhere... meteors in the sky could be edited in. 
On somewhat of an unrelated note, when replaying the cinematic, different words pop up very quickly within the first second, these are the words I've been able to pick up: 
Vindertech Universal Leader
Head
Picture
and an image of a triangle, a dinosaur skull, a planet and an eagle.

&amp;nbsp;

I know there are things that could counter this theory, such as what are the jump rocks and how do they link to movies, and what about the comets that hit the island in season 3 etc. But this is just a little personal idea of mine, maybe some of you can expand upon it!

-
Even after almost 1,000 matches, parachuting is not an exact science. Add that to the RNG of weapon spawns in houses, and sometimes you are left without a weapon in the initial seconds after landing. Starting with some materials will help combat those random immediate deaths and give more plays to escape/find a weapon. 

**(2) The amount of wood from farming should be increased slightly.**
-
Wood is the main fighting material. Farming 500 wood takes a decent amount of time at the current rate. At this point, build battles are only getting longer and consuming more materials. After a good build battle early-mid game, the winner can be left with almost no materials. Then a random guy watching the fight swoops in and kills the winner. The amount of wood harvested from objects should be increased about 20-25%. 

**(3) If possible, tie the spawn rate of launch pads to distance from first circle.**
-
I don't know if this would be possible or not, but it only seems logical. It feels bad to land at a normal, named location and get punished bc of early fights and a long travel to the first circle. (But overall, Fortnite has the best circle mechanics of any BR). 

**(4) Either limit the # of rockets one can carry, or decrease the spawns of rockets in the world.**
-
I don't think rockets alone are overpowered. They are a good yin to building's yang. However, sometimes it's just too much. There is no reason that a player should have 100 rockets, or a squad have 4 players who all have grenade launchers and 40 ammo. Increasing the materials harvested will help combat rocket spam, but overall, there should just be a limit and/or spawn decrease. The limit carried could be around 20 rockets. 

**(5) This is mentioned frequently, but vertical audio still needs improvement.**
-
I have no issues distinguishing above/below in PUBG, but in Tilted Towers high rises, it feels like guesswork. 

**(6) Slightly increase the distance at which you can hear other players build.**
-
I have had players build around 2 or 3 tiles away and the audio didn't register. You should be able to hear building from at least 5 tiles away. Building up on someone isn't a stealth play; it's an aggressive play. However, sometimes it works like a stealth play bc of the audio, and that should be changed. 

**(7) Maybe controversial, but remove the hop rocks/crystals from the game.**
-
The are not overpowered by any means, but I just find them unnecessary and contrary to the ""vibes"" of the game. Maybe the jetpack will replace them and be more in line with the feel of the game, but I would rather see the crystals removed in the meantime. ",FortNiteBR

Normally, battle royale games are made for ""hardcore gamers"" like my son and me. But, due to the cartoonish graphics, the emotes, and the other fun stuff in Fortnite, I just bought a Battle Pass for my daughter. 

My daughter has never played a shooter in her life. She's a complete potato, knows it, but doesn't care. She's happy because there are weekly challenges that she can complete and she has a full season to learn, practice, and get better at the game. This is a big deal because she has an anxiety disorder, is dyslexic, is a perfectionist, and gets frustrated easily when she doesn't do things well quickly. Fortnite is helping her learn that it's okay to not be good at something and to keep doing it so that she can develop a skill. Also, the alliteration of the names on the map helps her practice reading too. All of this stuff helps build her confidence and self-esteem while giving her something that she can talk about and do with me and her brother. This is a huge, huge deal in my family and it's great to see her tackle a challenge, giggle at all of the ridiculous cosmetic items in the game, and yell in frustration when she gets killed. 

TL;DR - My daughter who struggles with a lot in her life loves Fortnite and I'm really grateful she has the opportunity to play a fun game with me, her brother, and this community.  ",FortNiteBR

(E.g: possible burnout, drastic change in Meta, quiet moments are nice, etc.)

I believe the current match length is about 22-25 minutes (provided you make it to the final circle correct me if I’m wrong) and Blitz mode was capped at 15 minutes provided the final circle closes. An ideal game time would be around 18-20 minutes and using the idea of being able to see the first circle. The first 2 or 3 circles would be sped up to around Blitz length (slightly slower) while the final 3-4 circle speeds would remain the exact same (maybe like...10 seconds faster)

This would push the action together faster, promote a meta that blitz promoted where camping in 1x1s on the outskirts of circles with max materials isn’t the easiest way to victory, but still allow for quiet moments if you choose to land in quiet areas especially in the first few circles",FortNiteBR

They can make dozens of emotes each day, it's really not hard to make one. They should all cost 200V instead of 200-500-800.

You can sign the petition here and hopefully create a change: https://chn.ge/2IeqFYb

I know many of you are fed up with the poor rotation of the store i.e. Raven being released again for 2 days due to a new 500 v-buck emote being featured alongside it (while much requested skins are not being released e.g. Battle Hound).

Jump, build, jump build and jump build, then whip out the shotgun and see who's RNG is more favourable between the Jumping and Building.

Now, should epic wish to see some mild balance brought back or to witness players merely fighting each other without feeling the need to build a 1x1 iron mountain with petruding stairs from top to bottom.

To give the new players a chance against the no life wicks of the world that outclass builders on skill set of 10000000000 to 1.

It's simple, and here's my idea.

Termite grenades, wood louse rockets (where upon impact will immediately begin eating at somebody's structure until nothing remains, having a cool down period between building after suffering builders block - watching your MLG structure torn down would dishearten you for a rough 5 - 7 seconds.

This would allow players to instead flee, fight!


TLDR: a grenade that eliminates buildings and prevents the builder from building for a handful of seconds.  Letting you have a shootout instead of being Majorly outclassed by macroing no lifers?!",FortNiteBR

Even on console most people always double ramp up and wall block.

Do people even like this meta? Getting the jump on someone with an AR and then seeing them build 3 stories in 3 seconds doesn't seem particularly engaging.

And that's what I don't understand. We all know this game has taken over schools, and all these kids are playing, but why? This game hasn't been new user friendly for a long time. Those that play every day have gotten way too good and there's way too many of them. 

How do new players have a chance anymore? It might be free to play, but it's pay with your time to win. This game has fallen victim the same way other popular games like Hearthstone where the disconnect between people who play every day (i.e. 99% of all of us on Reddit) and the people who play a couple times a week is ridiculous.

Am I really the only one that believes making the building faster and faster just makes the game worse?

First, my stats are viewable [here](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/sc_oopr). I consider myself above average, unfortunately, some of you will consider my win totals low. To those who are in that school of thought, I have no rebuttal; I find that wins are like PPG in the NBA, they mean nothing compared to EWA(estimated wins added). Second, I'm 4 Seasons deep on Default button layout, I'm not switching unless my Fortnite career depends on it. This subreddit **begged** for a layout that allowed for faster building on console. I'm sorry but Builder Pro is an abomination and was not the answer. If I wanted to get into a build battle like what I see on popular PC streams, I would go play PC. Part of what makes console special is that IT IS different from PC. My love for this game has diminished slightly in the past few weeks because I rip someone's shields and by the time I put one shotty slug in the chamber, they have built 4 stories up and are drinking mini-shields. At this point, there's no going back, but adding in a different version of the layout to accompany those who want to maintain the default controls but benefit from spam building and avoiding gunfights like those highly-talented-Bob-the-Builder-wannabes would be appreciated.

Aiming sensitivity from distances is really difficult because the aim is almost ""grainy"". For example, when fine tuning my aim trying to hit someone really far away, I feel like it moves my camera in chunks of pixels rather than a smooth movement. It makes aiming incredibly difficult. I can't seem to hit anything (I'm also not good at kb/m). Can someone give me any pointers for settings that may fix this problem? Does anyone have really smooth aiming using a kb/m on the ps4?

I also am running into an issue where my kb/m randomly disconnects every few min. No warning, sometimes I'm not even touching it. Has anyone had that issue?

Thanks guys!",FortNiteBR

i will be honest i don't really understand how DPI works and while i have the option to have presets on my mouse, i don't want to bother moving it around so i just leave it at the one. 

I lowered my sensitivity halfway through last season, and i feel like this season i'm starting to finally play a little better. my KTD is slowly increasing, but i'm still losing some shotgun fights where i'm a tad slow (also my aim needs to improve). 

Building is also slow still. i can put up a corner (2 walls) and a ramp pretty quick, but i feel like i'm slow with the other 2 walls to close myself in. OTOH i feel like it's less important when i'm in the middle of a firefight to be able to spam. 

I got into a 'build fight' earlier today by which i mean i was jumping in, up, under and around forts with some stairs and floors trying to kill someone. i honestly think i did okay before i got blasted, but the other guy had 8 kills or something anyway. 

anyhow just curious if you guys can shed some light on if it sounds like i could use more DPI or sensitivity or not. i use a g602 and have a nice big xxl mousepad so surface area is not an issue.

It's a relatively rare skin due to how, less, legendary it is. It hasn't come back yet so it should remain as like, I was here at the start of Fortnite's rise.

Don't bring it back, theirs enough. Also let the people that made the mistake of buying it get a refund.

I'm sick to death of everyone complaining about double pumping but then endorsing this absolute scum play. I am sick to the back fucking teeth of being ""outplayed"" by some fucking 12 year old who thinks the best strategy is to shotgun rush and pray their pump hits for 95 before a fat swap to the tac to make up a scummy second hit for an instant pile of bullshit and a cheap emote showoff as if they did something incredible.

This update has completely sapped mine and whole friend group's enjoyment of the game with every match being dominated by some Ninja wannabe who has to use a cheap broken fucking tactic (which Epic did TRY to fix) to beat people. This game has become such a competitive shitbox in such a short amount of time that it's no longer enjoyable. Remember the fun of minigunning someone's base when that was added? Using impulse grenades to launch someone out of their base? The whole fucking game has become ""shotgun rush or spray a scar/smg for 3 minutes out of a 3 storey base"" simulator.

And don't even get me fucking started on the amount of fucking scum XIM users on console. I used to run into one maybe every few days. Now it's every hour there's some lowlife making very clear he's using a mouse after spinning 1400 times after getting the kill. Add on this update has increased character lag SIGNIFICANTLY and made anything above 100m near impossible on older consoles, it's clear all anyone cares about is the fucking battlepass.

I'm so fucking fed up of this community. It's toxic as fuck and anyone who voices legitimate criticisms are told to ""just build, lol"" or that they got ""outplayed"". The point blank smg spraying that only became popular because of people saw streamers do it with a mouse and saw the videos like ""SMG VS SHOTGUN MUST WATCH SMG BEST CLOSE RANGE GUN"". The ""OH THERE'S SHOTS NEARBY LET'S RUSH THEM AND GANG ON ONE TEAM"" mentality. I'd rather deal with fucking modders than this bullshit.",FortNiteBR

Basically, this only works on XBOX and it requires a few **Simple steps**. 

First, you have to go to Battle Royale and go to the Store for V-Bucks. Once you get there, you must click the package and click purchase. As the purchase is processing to the final menu to confirm the purchase, you make your XBOX go offline, then you go back online and go to Fortnite. If you get the timing correct, it will allow you access to Save the World. Now, you will have to do this everytime you quit the Save the World. I believe this is horrible and it is cheating out Epic Games.

I have used to glitch to test it and see what it can do. I found that it only takes a few attempts to get it working each time. I am worried that I am going to be banned for trying to test this glitch to report it.

If an Epic Games Representative can get this noted down, it would be amazing.

Thank you and my GT is Awesomeplayer27

I've learned so much from this sub with countless hours of laughs and entertainment - this is a very creative group of gamers. I would argue that we are the most tight-knit too. 

I know that a lot of you play this game because it's free and accessible to all - I know what it's like to game on a budget when all your friends have all the shiny new things. 

I've recently closed in on a big promotion at my job in IT and have a bit of expendable income. I could buy myself $30 in skins, but I think I'd rather choose a few guys/girls in the community and hook them up with the Battle Pass. 

This is where it gets tricky. I want to use the honor system and leave a comment below telling me your platform, Epic-name, what season you started, your first and favorite cosmetic item and your favorite Fortnite memory or something positive that came from you playing this game. I will choose one player from each platform. Please be honest and exclude yourself if you have the Battle Pass as I want to help only those who absolutely cannot afford it!

I will also choose ONE person whose story stands out to me and gift them the newest skin in the store. 

Love you, guys! Let's continue to make this the greatest gaming community online! Have an awesome day and remember to pay it forward!

433,2TapMcClap,1525553297,8haaw6,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8haaw6/accuracy_and_damage/,2,Accuracy and Damage,"I want to start this out by saying that no, i'm not the best at this game, nor am i claiming to be.  i've been playing since it pretty much first came out.  off and on, and i just came back from a 4 month break.  lets start.

RNG bloom in this game is still garbage.  We've all experienced it, we've all seen it.  Why is this still a thing? I get that Epic wants to cater to a casual crowd, but i personally dont get why you would create a shooting game, that IS competitive (you're competing to win), and say to yourself ""yup, lets make shots random!""

I remember the shooting test when it was leaked.  That...was AMAZING.  Shots landed, and it truly showed who was good, and who was lucky.  This ""first shot accuracy"" isnt cutting it.  Do they expect you to just sit, crouched, and have fights like that?  Cause the second you move, that bloom kicks in like crazy and there was no point.  Please, give us 100% accuracy with recoil and damage fall off.  Let us TRY IT AGAIN.  Here is my argument as to why i think it would be better.

Argument : Building would be more crucial.  Knowing that someone can three tap you will make building mandatory to survive and return fire.  That would raise the skill gap and focus more on the building aspect.  Cause honestly, if you're a good shot, nobody is going to be able to crouch in a field and two tap you while you're in a base.  No way.  So therefor, building would require more thought than ""i need the high ground"".  Keep the shooting model the way it is on mobile.  

Argument Against : It would turn off casuals because they would be running and get two tapped instantly.  Base camping MAY become the new thing to do, which is of course not fun.  (maybe to counteract it, make the buildings more fragile and make it so you cant just spam a wall in the place where yours just got knocked down).  

now, on to the damage.  one weapon in particular needs fixed IMMEDIATELY.  Shotguns.  IDGAF about double pumps.  I just want my shotgun to do CONSISTENT damage.  I 100% believe thats why the double pump rush was/is so popular.  Their first shot did 9 damage so they had to switch to get the rest of the damage off.  If the shotguns did a consistent damage, it would remove the need for a double pump strat (unless you want it) and free up some space for more items (people want more slots, nope).  Fix them...please.

So all in all, i want accuracy instead of RNG (its honestly a joke...cmmon now...) and shotguns to do consistent damage.  Like i stated before, i'm not great at this game, but even I KNOW when something is off.  BTW...i'm going to bring up accuracy every other day until i get an official NEW response.  I'm not going to let this go.  ",FortNiteBR

463,HexxDroid,1525548204,8h9qy4,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8h9qy4/replayroyale_dissapointment/,0,#ReplayRoyale dissapointment,"So i was just browsing through the winners and was getting the impression, by the way no offense to Epic or any participants.. Unfortunately it seems epic games has put literally almost no thought at all choosing the winners. 

Here are the criteria the judges supposedly based their decisions on.

* Up to 50 points for Mastery:
Did the video display a mastery of the Replay system?
Did you utilize the tools of the Replay system (i.e. - exposure, aperture, etc.)?
Was your video primarily composed using the Replay system?
* Up to 25 points for Creativity:
Did your highlights manage to represent the game in a creative or innovative manner?
* Up to 25 points for Fortnite-ness:
How well did you capture the tone of Fortnite Battle Royale through your highlights video?

And now take for example this video, it clearly portrays the tone of fortnite in an amazing light. is superior in cinematography, syncs the music, amazing transitions.. It gets put 20+ place. And then theres litteraly a replay royale that is basically someone using the guitar emote for 1 minute and 30 seconds and the difference between every scene is he at another location, sorry but almost no effort put in whatsoever, and he gets put 4th place??? Its a big bummer to see Epic didn't give a shit choosing the winners at all, and it looks like they just went with the one with most views scared they didn't let an underdog take a bite. Here's a [link](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/replay-royale-contest) to the winners if you're interessted.


[This is 24th place? c'mon Epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLwLBTtYFT0)

Where's the judging on creativity, **tone**, exposure, aperture, mastery of editing? What happened Epic Games? You guys aren't supposed to go with the masses. I see people who put actual effort in their videos get drilled in the ground by a generic kill montage with preset effects.",FortNiteBR

This shouldn't be the only method to fight in cqc but it is and it is slowly ruining the game for me.,FortNiteBR

I've had multiple games where I've been 100 Health &amp; Shield and I've gotten one shot with the Pump. I don't see how that's actually existing in the game. It shouldnt.

When you get that 100 Health &amp; Shield you're supposed to feel safe in a sense right? You're supposed to feel like its life insurance  in a way, because you have that extra health to fight back with. Well I don't feel safe at all, because you're still able to get one shot even with maximum health from a blue pump.

I don't know how this can be fixed, but I feel like you definitely shouldn't be able to get one shot with max health and shield. ",FortNiteBR

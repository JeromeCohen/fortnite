I‚Äôve played 100 matches and I‚Äôve gotten 2 kills. 2. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I‚Äôve tried a lot of different things and although I‚Äôm getting a lot better at the game I can‚Äôt aim for anything. It is getting really frustrating.  I could careless about winning at this point, I just want to accurately shoot someone. I‚Äôve watched players on YouTube, changed my sensitivity, practiced in playgrounds, learned which gun to use when, and I‚Äôve landed in Titled. Here‚Äôs the two scenarios that always happen to me: 


1) I land and I‚Äôm looting. It‚Äôs all peaceful and quit but then I I hear footsteps in my building. I freeze trying to figure out where they are coming from. It never fails within a couple seconds they find me and boom I‚Äôm dead. I might get in a missed shot or two but since I can‚Äôt aim I‚Äôm dead within seconds. My bullets seem to go everywhere but to that player. I might as well stand still and let them have the kill even easier than what it already was. 

2) I actually make it out alive after looting some, and I‚Äôm running/jumping/zigzagging to the circle. My goal is always to find a hill and build, and try taking out people by sniping. I don‚Äôt care about winning, I want kills. But this dream is broken by me getting shot in the back, 99% of the time. I swear only ninjas play this game haha. 

I started with a keyboard and mouse, but now I‚Äôm using a controller with my computer. I‚Äôve never played games on my pc and doing that has helped a ton. I know everyone says mouse and keyboard is better, but I‚Äôve gotten a little better with a controller. Anyway I‚Äôll quit rambling now. ",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôd love if there was certain ‚Äúpacks‚Äù in the item shops for pets called like ‚ÄúPet Packs‚Äù with different kinds of animals in them with 3 each. Obviously for some animals they‚Äôd have to be babies to fit in the backbling or for some they could just sit on your shoulder but yeah

Maybe like 800 v-bucks would be fair? Idk

My ideas for packs were

- Tiger, Lion, Cat ‚ÄúCat Pack‚Äù
- Parakeet, Seagull, Toucan ‚ÄúFlight Pack‚Äù
- Penguin, Polar Bear, Seal ‚ÄúIce Pack‚Äù terrible pun ik 
- Giraffe, Elephant, Monkey ‚ÄúZoo Pack‚Äù
- Deer, Bear, Raccoon ‚ÄúOutdoors Pack‚Äù

- Mammoth, Saber Tooth, Sloth (think sid the sloth from ice age) ‚ÄúIce Age Pack‚Äù
- Dolphin, Octopus, Shark ‚ÄúAquatic Pack‚Äù u/r32l_shiro idea


I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other packs that could fit into like themes but yeah I hope they‚Äôd do something like this.

Most of my playing time came on Friday and Saturday nights after my son went to bed. I finished season 5 with Tier 100, challenge skin (doing 7 of the full week challenges...I actually finished every single one except for the time trials - and maybe like....6 random wins under my belt (1 solo). I fell in love with this game. I'm awful, I don't even care. This is the only game I've ever been to play where I don't get upset when I die and just geniunely have fun all the time. Ok, I lied a little bit...I absolutely hate dying a minute into the game when I die without a gun because I didn't even have a chance lol. Anyway, this game brought me out of my single player slump because as a guy in his late 20's, a wife and a little man my video game time was almost non-existant because whenever I would try to play a multiplayer game my son would want me to play or my wife needed something so we all know you can't pause online games so I ended up just quitting them for a while.

So I woke up at 4am for work as per usual, and I turned my PS4 on and turned it back off in rest mode (to download the patch when it went live so I could play when I got home). I didn't expect to play yesterday, but things kind of worked out so I did get on at about 930pm EST. 

I ended up buying the advanced battle pass because my wife is going to have our 2nd son any moment now so I figure this season is going to get cut short, so let me try to get a little jump start on this season. So I play a few games, not doing so hot as I'm not warmed up and I was pretty tired last night. My last game around 11 pm I was duo'ing with one of my friends and we ended up winning. I got the Webrella early and out of the way (yes, it is fantastic looking in game as it is online) and I had one of my personally best games ever. I finished with 4 kills and my partner had 0, he probably had some assists but I was feeling myself this game (I think my record high is like 5 or 6 in 50 v 50 so that's not saying much) but it was awesome. I hit like 2 long snipes and won some gun fights after early panicking. We had to revive eachother twice because we got caught in the storm and took turns dying after reviving but we ended up surviving and taking the big ol VICTORY ROYALE.

Needless to say, it was hard to calm myself down to go to bed after that....and here I am less than 5 hours later I woke up again at 430am and drove into work.

I love you Fortnite, thank you making gaming great again.


tl;dr - I won a game on day 1 of s6, got the webrella in my best game and like Fortnite.

In season 5, they introduced a different kind of meta, shotguns weren't so viable anymore and SMGs got a little more love, which was an ok change for me (though I have to admit I loved double pump). Then there were experiments with explosive weapons regarding stacking size or ammunition limit. This is what I love about epic, they have no fear to try things and see people reacting (just remember trap damage buff from 75 to 150), even if it seems far of. 
I am really concerned about the season 6 changes and I hope it's some kind of experiment too what they have done with the mega vault, they basically took out items everyone enjoyed using (bouncer, I miss you so much). Instead of fixing these items and weapons if they thing they are unbalanced, they just took them away? That doesn't feels right to me. Instead, the came up with 
(Personal Opinion incoming, yours might be different) the worst Battlepass in the history of Fortnite which is basically a giant cash grab for kids. It's not about making a fun game for everyone, it's about making the most money. I mean pets, seriously? 
I am really concerned about the direction Fortnite is taking and epic has proven that they listen to suggestions and feedback a lot. So please, if there are more of you out there who feel the same, raise your voice, make posts and comments about this, don't let the only comments on Fortnites Twitter be ""when is Skulltrooper coming back epic plz""
We, as mature gamers are part of this Community too and I feel like we are underrepresented especially in this subreddit.

S5 completely changed the meta with double pump (for better or for worse), they added a whole new veichle that changed the game and they added a whole new region with several unnamed, and one massive named location. They replaced an old place with a completely new location. They overhauled an entire mountain with a whole new theme/area. 

S6, kind of did nothing. They added no new named locations, they changed the dynamic of Loot Lake pretty significantly, and added some dumbass Shadow stones. And some floating mansion. Not to mention vaulting several beloved items for no reason

This is more of a personal thing but the skins for S6 make me want to vomit, S5 made me really want to earn all the skins (with a few exceptions), there aren‚Äôt really any S6 skins that I want.

It is just simply inexcusable to have a 5 story height advantage disappear solely because your opponent has an item. You should have to build to me &amp; take highground, not grapple on to me, get blocked, grapple on to me, get blocked, grapple on to me, shotgun me for 125 damage, end up inside my box, and killing me. The item is broken. 15 charges was too much, 10 charges is STILL way too much, 5 charges would be too much, the item is hindering my ability to enjoy Fortnite to its full greatness. Bouncers were vaulted but not the grapple hook? What logic, what sense does that make? The bouncers were a diverse, skillful way of either navigating the map quicker, avoiding fall damage, making super jump pads, or taking highground (in a balanced manner.) the grapple hook instantaneously launches you 5 stories high and there is no delay when taking out the shotgun after using a grapple hook. The item needs to go. If you dont agree, explain why? Im open to hearing both sides. ",FortNiteBR

Always a sniper shooting at my back, or someone spamming an AR, I‚Äôm constantly having to build new walls behind me and around me while tracking my opponent. 

I have great situational awareness, I always know where I third party is coming from and where they‚Äôre located, mostly from playing R6, but that‚Äôs beside the point. 

Since mid last season I cannot even enjoy playing solos because mid fight there‚Äôs always someone shooting my builds and my opponents. Honestly it‚Äôs more annoying than a problem, and 80% of the time I come out killing them as well, but the times they do get me from cheap shooting me in the back or shooting us out of the sky it‚Äôs very tilting and just simply not fun because it happens so often. 

I understand it‚Äôs a battle Royale and the objective is to eliminate enemies and be the last person standing, but just wanted to hear others thoughts on the subject. 

TLDR; Solo‚Äôs feel more like a giant mosh pit of being shot in the back and spammers just slowing your initial fight down, as apposed to a few seasons ago they were 1v1, loot and move on to the next. ",FortNiteBR

We constantly get looked down upon by every other platform. Our platform is significantly worse than it was before the transition from season 4-5. Allow me to create a list of reoccurring or new problems since.




-The game‚Äôs textures are very low-rez. I know it‚Äôs a mobile device, but the textures sometimes look like how they do before they load in on consoles.


-Tying in with the last point, the graphics settings are completely broken right now. Not even the latest iPad or the latest phones can run Epic settings. This setting was also mysteriously taken away recently.


-The frames drop significantly at some points. Especially in cross-platform, the frames dip to a horrendous amount to the point where the game either freezes for up to 10 seconds or downright crashes. Not even playing on 20 frames helps.


-The audio and visualizer need to be reworked. There are many cases where the audio completely shuts off for a period of time and the visualizer also stops, which can result in deaths from behind that you, in no way, could be aware about. This problem is also very noticeable when voice chatting with friends.


-Voice chat also needs to be reworked. If you accidentally slide up or down depending on the device, pulling up a menu, even for a second, results in the game disconnecting from voice chat. Along with this, the game will freeze to reconnect too, which can lead to unfair deaths or just a heavy frame drop. Also when leaving the app and coming back, the game audio will get obnoxiously loud.


-The infamous ‚Äúinteraction bug‚Äù. This bug has been present since Season 3, which is more than half a year. Mostly happening to claw players, the game doesn‚Äôt allow you to edit, swap items, open doors, open chests, or use consumables such as mushrooms. This bug is downright the most annoying bug to encounter, and it is one that has been wanted to be fixed for WAY to long.


-No cape physics. A small one, but also pleasing to see. 


-There is no way to play emotes or pickaxes again in the item shop. Another small one, but mildly annoying.


-ATK and shopping cart driving doesn‚Äôt feel too fluent. Before Epic changed it, vehicles were able to be smoothly driven. Now, the control feels too slippery.


-Changing mats on accident. When tapping fast to scroll through traps, the game will sometimes switch to a different material.


-Small things that other consoles have. Things like the spectating eye and honking should be added. Even though they are small additions, Mobile players would still like them.



And now for the last one, which is important to a few while not to others.


Stats.


The main reason I want to bring this up is because of what Epic said in the State of Mobile post back in May. They targeted summer for release but failed to meet expectations. I would not be concerned with this if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that Epic has yet to acknowledge it again. Since May, I have heard no mentions of Stats anywhere. I would have been perfectly fine if there was a statement on why it was delayed.


TLDR- All in all, we mobile players are fed up. We‚Äôve been dealing with too many bugs and issues that Epic is yet to acknowledge.

(Repost because the greatest mod deleted my previous post because of prob the greatest reason ever) 

First of all, if youre a fortnite fanboy who can‚Äôt take any negative things about fortnite please do not even bother commenting.. just hit the downvote.. 

Allright, imo this season is the mark of the downfall of fortnite. Season 5 already was way to slow, nothing happend in the map, people stopped playing because of the spray and pray meta, the double barrel destroyed hearts etc. And dont get me wrong! Season 5 brought some amazing elements to the game such as Rifts (prob. One of the greatest game feature designs imo), ATK, grappler gun etc. 

But the let downs are huge.. large portions off the community fell of due various choices epic made. Such as re releasing super rare skins, nerfing the shotguns by adding a delay and a unneccary pallet hit overlay, nerfing wood so the spray and pray meta became even powerfull... i mean this actually ruined the game slowely. Fortnite was fun in its peak because of the constant changing gameplay.. nowadays u wont get far if u dont rock a shotgun-smg combo.

‚ÄúGetting shot at? Build some!‚Äù &lt; This isnt even a thing anymore.. we all die to the same situations over and over and isnt changing. 

And now onto season 6:
Okay cool they updated the map just a little bit, made some changes here and there. Cool. Now i know the story is even out yet but boy; the skins look so OFF, the battlepass rewards are getting worse. There is a contrail THATS LITTERLY 2 ROCKET EXHAUST FLEX TAPED AROUND YOUR WIRST. What happend???
The spray and pray meta is still here, the awfull weapon balancing issues are still here, they added shadowrocks or something like that... how does that even fit in a battle royale such as fortnite. Hop rocks was great fitted the whole game well.. this shadow thingy is pure bs. 

Getting to irritaded at this point, goodnight.

Season 2 was medieval themed, pretty cool for a 20 something guy. Season 3 we say an awesome space theme with John Wick, all around cool skin, as the reward for max battle pass tier. Season 4, I personally saw the decline in the skins offered in the battle pass with pretty much the only cool skin being the Omega, in my opinion. Season 5 was alright, more of a summer theme, understandable. Not bad, nicest skin would be the Sun Strider. Ragnarok was interesting, as in my opinion Fortnite was trying to make him too ‚Äúbadass‚Äù for the game, which makes me believe it was targeted toward a younger crowd that would think something like that would be petty awesome. In my opinion I would much rather play with a ‚Äúsilly‚Äù or ‚Äúfun‚Äù looking skin such as the Mullet Maurauder or Snorkel Ops instead of trying to look like a ‚Äúbadass‚Äù player with big, wannabe scary horns and face, in Ragnarok. Season 6, I am not a fan of any of the skins. At all. They are all very childish, for lack of a better word. I am almost tempted to not even purchase the season 6 battle pass because I find none of the skins would be worth the money.

After the start of season 6, I noticed, that while the skins and accessories were flashier than ever before, this season added nothing that interested me. At least Season 5 added riffs and a whole desert and ATKs, but now this game doesn‚Äôt feel like fortnite anymore. 
Change can be a good thing for games, but fortnite has been changed so much in its lifetime that it is a whole different game. Inconsistent gameplay is what comes to my mind, as this game can be painfully (very very painfully) frustrating one day, and I can be doing amazing the next day. I know how good I am at the game, and I know my limits. I‚Äôm not better than any professional, but I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm nice at the game. I die all the time to terrible players that are spamming an smg or using all of their materials to kill this one guy. And it is this unbalanced and frustrating lack of a skill gap that makes me want to quit. 
I should be rewarded as a player for learning this game. I‚Äôve spent over 400 hours learning and adapting... but I‚Äôd argue that I have to adapt too much. Epic constantly removes guns and features such as see-through edit walls or rifts so much, that if someone stopped playing back in April, it would be like a whole new game; a modded version of fortnite unrecognizable to anyone that hasn‚Äôt played in a month. Again it is a waste of time to learn how to use the pump shotgun or use the double barrel, only for them to change, nerf, or completely remove it. The meta changes too frequently, and guns should either be all balanced equally, or some guns should inherently be stronger (such as the shotguns in season 3). I‚Äôm not saying they should fix totally game breaking methods such as double pump or the Compact SMG/entire spray meta, but I‚Äôd just like consistency in the gameplay. 
Epics catering to new players, decreasing the skill gap to the point where there barely is one, is not only frustrating but insulting that I had to put time into a game only for it to not matter. 

Games should change, but constant change and frequent removal of weapons/buffing and nerfing is excessive. 
I thought Epic knew what they were doing, adding weekly updates that actually impacted the game and made it a better experience. Fortnite will eventually die. But it is not going to die because it got boring, it‚Äôs dying because Epic is killing it. 

TL;DR. Make the game more consistent, and stop changing everything. 
Don‚Äôt cater to new players or bad players and reward your dedicated fan base because they are the ones who put time into your game and they will be the ones that will stay when the fortnite trend goes away. 


I‚Äôm done playing fortnite. There are objectively better games out and games that are coming out this year that actually have consistent gameplay and know how to treat their dedicated fans. 
I should be excited to level up my new battle pass. I still have challenges to do and tiers to unlock, and it‚Äôs sad that I don‚Äôt want to play despite all of the ‚Äúcool skins.‚Äù 

Yeah Epic keep doing whatever I guess you‚Äôve made your money anyway.

Honestly, Season 6 has been so far the best  fun I've had on Fortnite since the glory days of Season 2. The battle  pass is pretty good, the map changes are great, everything's fine.

And then this happens.

I  was on 5 kills, last 15 people. I hear someone, so I start to look for  where they are. I begin taking damage out of nowhere, or so I thought,  and I couldn't see anyone.

Turns out there's this ""Arctic Assassin""TM  with an invisible playermodel that just killed me because I had no clue  where they were, and then afterwards proceeds to kill multiple other  people because they can't see this person's playermodel at all. So I'm  here wondering, is this just a known / rare bug or is it an exploit?  Either way, it's immensely unfair and needs to be fixed ASAP.

I personally don't think its okay either.. and I am almost certain there will be backlash once parents are aware of what has just been put into the game. If this game wasn't rated E for everyone I wouldn't bat an eye but you must understand it raises concern. 

If I am simply overlooking things please fill me in as to how and why.

When someone else had the Shadow Form, they can just easily sneak up on you and destroy you easily if they have a good gun, then when you have a Shadow Form, it just isn't fun to use, it feels \*incredibly\* slow (not saying that it should be fast tho) and boring because the phase ability is just a one trick pony, it sounds cool, but you can't do much with it other than tediously roam around (links to slowness) and sneak up on people or camp somewhere (which is obviously super unfair for players that just want to play normally and have fun (like meeeeeee)).

I ultimately just want to see it go, I returned to Fortnite today after not playing since Week 2, Season 5 and I just don't like the new direction the game's going in. I kinda wanna see a mode where you just go back to Season 1 or something and just play like you would in simpler times.",FortNiteBR

Especially the idea for pets, which i still havent tried out so i hope they do more than react when youre shot and react when you win. Sadly, while scrolling through the battle pass, although i was amazed, i kept a straight face for the entire thing and with each page all i could think was about how boring the fact that the meta hasnt changed is. I was almost sure there would be some variety added, but nope we are stuck with the same low skill requirement meta and there was no change to shotguns... I want every single thing in the battle pass, but im not sure i want to ~~suffer~~play that much especially now that ive started school. I might be acting selfish, towards casual players, for wanting a higher skill meta, but i got into this game expecting a **competitive** shooter. I think the best way for this game to go, is to add two meta loadouts. One would be good and easier,but something worse players could use and would slightly rely on luck, like it is now with smgs, and the other would be something much harder to use but would be more rewarding. Im probably complaining for nothing and im expecting responses such as ''if you dont enjoy dont play'' alongside downvotes which ive usually gotten over posts like these, but i miss learning new mechanics and i miss analyzing my deaths rather than saying ''should have been luckier'' **in some instances**. So i guess the only reason i continue playing, is because i know epic will at some point take a more competitive turn to the game to set the good players apart from the decent ones.",FortNiteBR

In this post, i will be talking about the skins and one emote. No gliders, no axes, no sprays, no contrails, no music, no loading screens, nothing but the skins and one emote. 

Lets just go in order.

DJ Yonder - he's decent, but just something seems *off* . Overall hes in top 3

Calamity - IMO, she just seems like the southern drift, since they both follow the trend of starting off with normal clothes and then evolving further in to a mess of carpet physics. Still, one of my favorites from this season.

Giddy Up - A mess of a confusing hitbox. overall this skin doesnt really seem that thought out, just thrown in as some sort of gag skin.

Fable - Anime Red riding hood. Again, something just seems *off* about it and it makes me uncomfortable. only one ima rate so 2/10

Dusk - By far my favorite skin. Its Halloween themed and doesnt look like a direct ripoff of the default skin with some new clothes on.

Nightshade - I shouldnt have to explain this one, its literally just Fate with a shitty mask on.

Dire - Basically tfue. I think its pretty disappointing teir 100 starts as a default. Sure, the unlockable styles are neat but they are so different from the level one dire in doesnt feel like they should be the same skin.

**BONUS** gotta go emote - A disgrace to our youth.

Overall, memeing aside, this season seems pretty weak overall. sure, we got the OG music, but that doesnt make up for the mashed up, nonsensical skins that are in season 6.",FortNiteBR

 \-charges the color of the black rings around the top of the sleeveless area, to a goldish

\-her fishnet is smaller. The holes are smaller and it looks wierd

\-a white bar has been added to her back, and the soles of her shoes are more white.

at least add editable styles for a skin you make changes to. Those of us that love power chord dearly would at least like an option to keep the old.

Lucky bloody Landing, the place where no man has been since it first showed up 6 months ago. Over and over I landed at this desolate town on the edge of the world, just longing to see another soul, but none would come. Game after game I landed at the tallest tower and kept watch but nobody was to be seen.  
That was until 30 minutes in, when the bus flew directly over Lucky Landing as its first drop, eager bodies poured from the sky straight towards this place and I jumped out of my seat with anticipation. This would be the game, this is the moment I get to complete my battle pass.  
Oh how wrong I was. I landed in the tall corner house, looted up and made my way down the staircase. Bullets were flying outside, there was explosions and death happening all around. I was eager to get into the fight.  
As i got to the bottom of the stairs my worst nightmares became a reality. The razor sharp points of a spike trap descended from the ceiling to penetrate my skull and crush not only my body, but my hopes and dreams.  
A cry of rage erupted from within me and I had to take a minute to recover.  
When I was ready to go again, the same cycle of solitude continued. I landed, nobody was there, I left the match and queued up again.  

After 45 minutes of this process (now 2am) i noticed something out the corner of my eye. As i was hopelessely gliding in for the millionth time, I recognised a figure below me, it was a Drift skin! He was heading straight to my usual corner house so i swerved quickly and landed at the house closest to the large pagoda. It was just me and him. He did not see me.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I swiftly looted the house, equipped with a Tac shotgun and a Hunting rifle I made my way to roof to scout my prey. I could not see him. I scanned the area to every inch but after 2 minutes I could not see him and just as I gave up hope of ever seenig him again he ran across into the big pink tree.  

Silently, I waited at the top of the roof, looking down the sights of my rifle I followed my prey every step of the way, execising every last ounce of patience I had, waiting for the perfect shot.  
Drift emerged from around the corner of the wall and time slowed down in an instance as the cold blood shot through my veins, I uncrouched, I lined up my crosshair and pulled the trigger. The bullet soared down onto him and with pinpoint acuracy it went straight through the mans skull, 225 damage. The one bullet which completed my fortnite season.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I satyed on that roof, hunting rifle in hand until the storm closed around me and took me to a place much better than I had just been. ",FortNiteBR

In my opinion, the regular SMG should have been vaulted, but that‚Äôs another conversation. I just want shotguns to be useful and not just being sprayed down by some no skin playing with a steering wheel. So here are some suggestions:

- Remove the delay when switching shotguns, keep the pump delay to allow slower double pumps or pump/tac combos.

- Makes pumps more accurate and consistent, maybe add in one pumps again?

I feel like SMGs on their own are in a decent place, sub 20 damage per shot, maybe a bit of a slower fire rate, but they tend to get annoying. Heavy shotguns are in a nice place, but I‚Äôm still a bit uncomfortable with the DB, but I can‚Äôt say anything since I haven‚Äôt used it after nerf. Let me know what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

So Before I put my opinion out there I should let you guys know that I have been playing Since late season 2 and have got the last 3 battlepasses(my fav one was season 4).
Now imo the new Battlepass is cool and all but it's nothing compared to season 3 or 4.
The skins just seems so boring (except for maxed out calamity and dire).
The pets are a cool new addition but I feel like once most of us unlock them, we're gonna forget they even exist.

Once again this is just my opinion and I would like to hear you guys' thoughts on this!

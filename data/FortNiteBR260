#The meta should not change for you, *you* should change with the meta.

Being a good player is about adapting to what is good and effective! You should know how to build and shotgun, but you should also be incorporating SMGS as they are the current meta.

I'm  fairly new to Fortnite BR and I have some questions towards random  stuff since I'm a noob and playing just for fun with friends:

\- Are there any free skins? (like the Twitch Prime ones, are they still avaliable?)

\- Will past Season skins (like the Reaper) be avaliable for V-Bucks purchase?

\- Are macros allowed? Primally for builing. If yes, any recomendations?

\- What does a Win do? Aside from you being happy. (more EXP?)

\- Weapons of higher rarity (green, blue, purple, gold) do more damage or is the precision higher? Maybe both?

\- I saw a crossbow in some videos but never encountered one. Is it still in the game?

\-  Is it better to jump out of the bus as soon as possible right into the  action or fly over an area with no one around for safe loot?

That's about it, since I could find other stuff on youtube or other guides.

I knew for sure that I’m at an incredible disadvantage because everyone is so experienced already, but as long as I have determination and perseverance at indomitable levels, I’ll exceed. Unfortunately, it has proven to be more complicated than it’s been, and the pressure about it keeps building and building.

I’ve always had a KD that is far from an awful one, nearly at a 2.0 KD overall. I get high kills in a good amount of games. One thing I haven’t gotten and probably will never get, is a fairly-strong record of wins especially solos. I’d constantly get second places not only in solos, but in duos and squads as well. 

I lost count of how many I have in total. In one night, I’ve gotten three second place finishes in a row. One of them would without a doubt be something that’ll curse me for the rest of my gaming life. One time I had an incredible high ground advantage over the last guy, and I brought down him to a one-shot with a scar. Before I could finish him off,  I slipped off my stairs and fell to my death, understanding that even amidst my games to win, I’d somehow still lose.

At this point, it’s no longer about “gitting gud” unless I’d intend to be a literal god at game. I was so determined at first, but now the pressure to win becomes even greater every time I get so close to winning, and my bad luck will always get to me, and so there I understood that solos are more impossible than I’ve anticipated. Players are still getting better and more confident to this day as I keep on faltering, I won't win anymore, and there's nothing I can do about it.

I need your guys’ help. I feel so insecure about this. Should I be cursed by this harsh fact for the rest of my life, or is there really no shame in accepting these series of losses, and be grateful I even have two solos and a fair amount of duos and squads anyways?",FortNiteBR

~ also, a note: before you turn away from seeing the size of this post, please bear in mind that other people might struggle with similar problems as me and that reading your advice and help could also help more players than just my struggling ass! :)

Hey guys. I know a lot of you are probably bored of these kinds of posts; the kind with the wailing noob that just complains about how the game is broken and that's why they're terrible, with a plethora of comments that eventually add up to 'get gud'. But bear with me if you can and hear me out, because I'm not going to go on a rant about game mechanics and blame the game for my own failures - in fact I completely understand that it's my own shit skill level that is stopping me from achieving any high kill games and wins. 


However, I understand with so little information it'll be hard to help me. Let me give you some background info.

* I play on PC, with nice good specs and no lag or any noticeable problems to do with my hardware.
* I've been playing since round about January this year.
* I don't really buy skins themselves however I have bought the battle pass for season 4 (and then used my earned V-Bucks to buy the season 5 one). Essentially, I've paid money on the game but nothing too wild. 
* I got to season level 68 last season, and completed all the week challenges so in turn got to tier 100 (RIP to all the omegas like me with the lights still locked). I tend to use this as self validation that I'm not horrifically bad at the game, but I understand it's not exactly a rare feat. 
* My highest kill game (not a LTM) was 7 kills, in a solos. 
* I can normally get about 2 kills a game but above that is not all that likely. A good game in my opinion is a game with ≥4 kills, even without making the top 3 or winning. 
* I have 3 wins on solo. I'm fairly certain one of them was a Thanos victory so that doesn't really count. I can only remember one of the others. The one I can't remember may well have also been an LTM. I have 1 duo win, which is ok seeing as I barely play duos, and 2 squad wins. So yeah, not exactly hard hitting.
* I can generally get myself into the top 10 of most solo games, however normally only with about 2 kills. I don't camp in bushes or buildings all match, but I'm also not all that fond of being out in the open.  
* I would describe my skill level at either average or just below average, but it really varies between the different frameworks of the game; at building and shotgun aim I'm almost absolute horseshit, but at sniping and the majority of other weapon use I'm alright/good. 



Now, I hear you saying to yourselves, ""well pat_456, that's all well and good, but how am i supposed to help you with this? what are you struggling with?"". But oho, my friends, *there's more*.


I also happen to know the majority of what I'm struggling with:

* **Building Defensively.** When I'm fired on, I can quick as hell make a nice little wall or 1x1. I can get the first line of defense up pretty easily, but if it doesn't end up as a sniper shootout, I'm almost always screwed. When I get moved up on, I rarely notice until they get too close on their ramps for me to do much. I normally go full panic mode and choke and then die.
* **Building (you guessed it) Offensively.** I struggle to make ramp-wall combos and to be honest when this sub was going through the phase where all the posts where about meme ramp push methods I was utterly bamboozled that people could even do that. I struggle with building up even on just 1x1s sometimes - but mainly only if they know I'm moving up on them. Whenever i ramp push and they copy me I have no idea what to do/panic without any real method, building walls and stairs everywhere. Similarly, when I ramp push and they end up higher than me, I have no idea how to counter it, and once again I meet with my old friend, panic-building. 
* **Shotgun aim.** HOW THE HELL DO YOU GUYS ALWAYS HIT HEADSHOTS?? My enemies always seem to move way too fast for me to really get my cursor over their head and fire. I understand shotguns are pretty much fixed and I don't have much of an excuse, so I figure that there must be a problem with how I'm doing it. One thing I do frequently is jump around hip firing, because you can't aim down sights while jumping. I'm not really sure how to break that habit. I tend to be the guy that hits off 20 of your health with a skim-shot before you one-pump his ass. Sorry bout that.
* **Panicking in the top 10.** Here's a funny story; you know that one win that I do remember? Yeah, well, I had no idea the last guy I killed was the last guy. The same happened for all the duo and squad wins I have. I seem to suddenly play like shit whenever I realise I'm in the top 10. I even tried a couple of times to actually plaster with a piece of tape over my screen where the player count is so I couldn't get stressed over it, but unfortunately that didn't help my aim nor my building skills so I still lost all those games.
* **Panic Building.** Oh gods, where do I start. Have you ever encountered one of those no-skins that builds stairs everywhere when you shoot at them, the majority of which aren't even nesscessary? Yeah, that's pretty much me but with a plain Omega or 3rd level Drift skin on. I don't know what it is, but whenever the enemy has the high ground, I'm too afraid of being shot from above to actually build up properly, and tend to end up boxing myself in halfway down the structure after falling off it somewhere. I think I make up about 25% of all edit-peek kills. And even when I do try to play ultra agressively, I tend to burn through mats pretty fast when I'm spamming random structures and I tend to have to play in a very risky way (shooting wherever on them I can when they try and shoot at me from above) as I can't build up. Ironically I survive most early-game fights when nobody has any mats - so basically I get kills from shooting straight, not building well. I know this community hates the whole nerf on mats because it caters to noobs, and to be honest I agree, even though I'm the kind of player that's directed to help. I understand that without building this game would be any other battle royale game but still, I find it a lot easier to get kills in open combat - probably a sign as to why I'm so crap.
* **Shit reaction times.** I envy all you people who can pull off trickshots like nobody's business, cause I really can't. It takes me about a second to realise I'm in combat with someone, at which point they are already building up, and another second to process each of their different building pieces. I'm not dumb (I don't think) but I definately struggle with reacting to problems quickly and making split second decisions. I don't know if I can ever fix that tbh - it sounds like something biological that I can't really change, but hey, prove me wrong, please, I'd be glad. 


So yeah, that's the majority of my problems. It feels good to write them down, even if this post has become an absolute behemoth. Sorry about that. Nobody is under any oath or obligation to respond and give help, but if you could spare me some of your time and help a struggling brother out, it would be very considerate. I want to get better because I feel like a bit of a burden for my friends and teammates in squads, and also to this community which has such a high skill level. I just wanna join you guys a little further up the skill ladder is all, and finally feel like I deserve the kills I get and the skins I wear. If you've read this far, thanks, and thank you to anyone who gives me some help. Hey, maybe with a bit of advice and confidence, I might even get my second real solo win. :)",FortNiteBR

I used to play with a full team of friend almost every night. They all had the battle pass, so grinding up was really easy with the addition of each bonus even if we were not really good. I recently found a job and i can't play as late as before with my friend. So now i mostly play in solo mode. I'm not the best player but i have a pretty descent level. I play safe spot in beginning of game because i don't like the RNG of the landing and getting the best weapon first. I would say that my average of kill by game is 5 and i'm getting one victory in 5 games in general.

 So why am i telling you this ? Cause i've done some maths to see how much games and Xp i have to do daily if i wanna reach 500,000 Xp. Based on my average, a game with 5 kills + victory royale will give you something like 1500 Xp. All the weekly challenge done will give you 50,000 Xp. So you have to make 450,000 Xp by playing to the game. I have actually 60,000 Xp. 20,000 from the weekly challenge and 40,000 by grinding up. I have 390,000 Xp left to make
and there is 64 days before the end of the season. Quick maths thanks to the calculator gives me 6,000 Xp to do every day. So this means seeing my average that i have to do 4 games with 5 kills +  the victory royale every day. Spoiler alert, i never done 4 wins in a row so i have to do more games than just 4. A game lasts usually 25 min so i have to play almost 2 hours every day + being good and doing kills if i wanna be sure to reach 500,000 Xp.

Epic could we please know exactly what gives Xp ? Could you please buff the 50vs50 mode and give as much Xp than the other modes ?And please Epic, add more Xp weekend for solo players like me, most of players are not pro player and can't play every days for hours..",FortNiteBR

So I designed a rough idea for a challenge system that would accomodate players of all skill levels","One of my all time favourite games is MW2, the challenge system was so in-depth and fun it kept the game alive long after its release. So my idea is roughly based around that system.


All these challenges will scale. So they will have multiple parts. E.g. medic #1: heal a downed teammate 5 times, medic #2: heal a downed teammates 10 times etc. Etc.


weapons: Every single weapon will have its own set of challenges from the bolt-action to revolver. These challenges will be no different to daily challenges for weapons. So get X amount of kills or X amount of damage. This will encourage some variety in gameplay. The ideal reward for this is gun camos. The challenges will scale between 5 kills to 250 kills for rarer camos. If you unlock all camos for every weapon you get a new camo (or another reward to incentivise using different guns- a skin inspired by the punisher would be amazing)

Medic: This will be your bandages, med-kits and all the shields. These challenges will also be straight forward. Just drink or heal X amount of times, there could also be 'revive' challenges which requires you to heal your teammates X amount of times and/or drop these items X amount of times for teammates to heal and shield up. The rewards for these could be a first-aid backbling and a pickaxe resemblind any number of a doctor's tools.

Throwables: This will cover clingers, C4, greandes and stink bombs. They can be cause X amount of damage to structures/players. Clingers could be unique and have a challenge for sticking players. The reward for this could be a green emote like juggling, except with bombs.

Tactical gear: at the minute we only have bushes, but if jetpacks or eye of the storm trackers return this could be included. E.g. survive X amount of cummulated minutes as a bush, fly up X amount of cummulated metres with the jetpack. 

Vehicles: again pretty straightforward. Travel a total of X amount of metres in a shopping kart, same for the ATK. Other challenges could be freefall X amount of total metres and survive. Rewards could be items to customise carts and atks. You could also get a toy thats an RC car or paper airplane.

Explorer: this could be search X amounts of chests, parachute/travel X amount of distance, land at every POI X amount of times, find all the random artifacts scattered throughout the map. Indiana Jones skin as a reward, umbrella glider with the map of the world on it.

Builder: gather X amount of wood/brick/metal, construct X amount of wood/brick/metal structures. Jackhammer emote, maybe an upgradeable construction worker skin where through the stages he grows a beard, hard hat, safety glasses etc.

Game modes: outlive X amount of opponents in solo/duos/squads, place top 25/12 etc. In solo/duos/squads, eliminate x amount of opponents in solo, duos, squads. Rewards could be a flag pole pickaxe and you can then unlock flags to customise your flag pole. E.g. a llama, a nationality picker and a black skull and bones flag for completing all 'game mode' challenges.

For completing every single challenge there would be a secret reward set. Whenever new LTMs come out, release a set of easy challenges which allows people to earn 'participation rewards' such as flags, throwable emotes and banners. (Throwable emotes should then be included in customising vehicles.

As you can see these challenges are no more difficult than daily challenges and it would allow all skill levels to fairly grind it out. This would be exclusive to battle-pass holders and progress will carry across all seasons. Ideally this would be a lengthy grind where it would take weeks upon weeks, for even the sweats to complete everything.

2. Add a weapon swap timer to smgs as well to prevent pump or heavy to smg, which would be too strong.
3. Remove the pump's weapon swap delay to make it an even more viable close range weapon.

My first suggestion would be to make the pump and heavy be able to one-shot again. You might say that pump to smg will be too overpowered since you can just use your smg if you miss your pump shot, but to counter this, smgs should have a swap delay like the shotguns do, so that using a pump is a risky play, but can be very rewarding. 

The equip time animation when pulling out your pump should also be removed, since with the timer double pump is not usable anyways. This would make edit plays and quick reaction plays possible. 

I think the smgs are fine, but you shouldn't be able to use them in combination with a pump, hence the swap timer.

In conclusion, you shouldn't be able to use a combo of a shotgun and an smg. They should both be a viable close range gun on their own. This would not only diversify the meta but add inventory space so you can carry and extra medical item, sniper, rpg, c4, grenade etc.",FortNiteBR

But now, I ditch ARs for SMGs or the drum gun. Sometimes I don't even take a scar to have those beasts of SMGs. Plus now the Bobcat (from STW) is going to be added as a purple/gold SMG I guess so the meta will just kill ARs.

In order to compensate for the SMG domination I think the AR should have a bit more accuracy when shooting, thus less bloom or spread whatever you want to call it. I'm talking about gray, green and blue ARs especially. Scar seems fine but if this SMG thing will need a scar rework too I don't mind.

I think they should give the last man standing an ultra buff to make it more fun for everyone. 

So if there is more than 10 players left on the winning team last man is activated. 
Rift sucks him in and gives 50 shield for each person remaining. I.e if 10 remain then you get 500 shield.

No. I agree it sucks having blooms randomness mess you up, but I think that’s where the most unique aspect of this game comes into play, building. This allows people that do not excel in weapons, to redeem themselves with building.

3. Scoped AR rarity (The gun is never used, I think lowering it down to green and blue would be better, I hate finding a damn purple one of these in a chest)

4. Grenades, Clingers etc. (The items only show when you hold down to throw or when you throw. I think just hold out the grenade in your inventory should show in your hands like any other gun.)

5. Canoe or water transport (I'm keeping this one simple, loot lake is crap when your stuck in the middle and have no materials. I'd like another way to get across.)

6. Pump Shotgun (Now in my opinion, I hate the way Pumps are right now. The delay on the pump to pump is slow as hell, if your going to add that timer upon switching shotguns, then make the pumps pull out time like it used to be.)

7. Airdrops (Can we just have confirmed traps, heals and one gold gun. Along with that a load of ammo for that certain gun. It'll be helpful I promise)

8. Tomato Town (I've seen many posts of concepts for this and I really agree. Just make it a real town, the loot is trash compared to other places, especially if you've just come from Waling woods or Riskey Reels.)

9. Changes (Epic, if you would make changes to things thinking it'll help, just test it first, not saying that you don't. But maybe a testing server might help?)

10. Hand Cannon/Revolver (These guns are great to use, but I just hate the little amount of damage you do, it might not need a change but I still feel like its just too weak.)",FortNiteBR

When turbo building, the first piece takes 0.15s to build, and at a fire rate of 0.05s per shot, that’s 3 bullets immediately before a piece builds. 

Turbo building is also at 0.05s after the first piece, so interesting to see if bullets can still pass through the walls between placements.

Personally I hope that there’s no FSA and has bloom like the LMG so this weapon won’t be too overpowered; otherwise we’re looking at a even heavier smg meta.

Few years later majority of the casual players will most likely leave, and the remaining players will be the ones who enjoy this game for what it is (or was).

I’ve seen a lot of complaints from veteran players about the current state of the game and I’m honestly annoyed. I Understand why veteran players are angry about the current shot gun meta. They spent months investing in an ability to effectivly use pump shots guns and double shot gun shooting methods. It takes actual skill to consistently hit head shots with a pump, especially on console. It takes a lot of time of dying to opponents with tac shotguns and smgs  until a player can consistently win with pumps. In other words, there is a cost of learning. EPIC has recently decided they don’t care about the learning costs incurred by veteran players and ITS FINE. It’s also the RIGHT call. Double pump building wars were fun, but they also got stale. 

Currently, There is a variety of weapons that can be effectively used in close quarters. Before I retired I stopped carrying ARs. I have a very aggressive play style and the updates have actually allowed me to get more kills and wins. Why? Because I build better than most people on console and rarely get hit. During the golden age of pumps, I could out build an opponent, jump down, shoot him in the chest, and immediately die after getting shot in the head by a pump. Now, the winner of a battle almost AlWAAYS lands more shots on the loser, which is how a shooting game should be. 

But why are veteran players REALLY mad ?
Because They can no longer rack up 15 kill wins by murdering a bunch of noobs that just started playing. The average skill level has consistently gone up around the mid point of season 4. As the number of new players joining the game began to decline, easy kills became harder to find. Most  people playing the game today are average to hard core players that love the game and NOT a bunch of noobs who can’t aim or build a simply structure. The addition of builder pro on console also allowed average players to quickly approach the highly skilled players’ ability to build. 

Also, People have been complaining about getting spammed by smgs in build battles and in most cases it’s people in favor of pumps that are doing the complaining. It’s funny because a good builder can outbuild an smg spam, but an average building who is super talented with pumps cannot. Thus, we see the problem. Good players who rely too much on  1-2 shot kills with pumps and have effectively failed to learn how to use any other weapon or use basic battle strategy are now AVERAGE players.  THIS is a good thing. Players that are good at building, strategy, shooting, etc. can now out class someone who is amazing with pumps and average at everything else. 

The overall skill level needed to win games has actually gone up since the numerous pump nerfs 

The pump supporters are doing nothing other than complaining that they aren’t relatively as good as they used to be. 

So, for those of you who want the pumps to be reinstated back to their former glory, get good and stop complaining.....",FortNiteBR

Full credit to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4454XqyOC8) video, saw it and thought I'd make a post about it! You can follow the steps here or watch the video!

Step #1:

Go to [fortnite.com](https://fortnite.com)

Step #2:

Scroll all the way down until you find the yellow button that says ""Sign up for fortnite news""

Step #3

Click this button, and then proceed to hit the Subscribe button in the popup.

Step #4

Wait a few hours to a day and you should receive the banner!  


This works for most users, but some might not get it. You will have to contact EPIC support if you don't get it and hope the person gives you it. Saying something like ""I signed up for the newsletter but didn't receive the fortnite banner that was promised"" should get you it. Half the time they will give you it, while the other half they will say ""We do not give out this banner anymore."". This is a lie, as they get so many requests (I assume) every day.

With the latest push they've made splodes and smg's incredibly powerful and made shotguns (or assault rifles) less necessary to use and pushed them out of the meta. This push I believe is to create a meta where skill isn't required, because lets be honest, using ridiculously powerful explosives and holding forward with a 50 round SMG requires no skill at all. 

Building is slowly becoming pointless because everything shreds almost immediately and this is even more apparent in duos and squads, but still solos as well. 

When the BR mode first released Epic probably didn't think it would do so well, it managed to get a niche group playing it and we found ways to make it competitive, and quite frankly the skill ceiling was much higher in the older days. But as the game has gotten older and Epic has made it's push towards ""we want all play styles to be viable, just not building"" they are slowly killing the skill ceiling making it stupid easy for anyone to win. It's sad to see that this game is turning into a ""just hold forward and spray with drum gun and shoot rockets"" type of meta, but even now with a P90 coming out, it'll probably continue to get worse. 

I can only hope that Epic realizes the cancerous meta they are creating and makes a lot of these changes better.",FortNiteBR

- if the replay system show your gameplay ( from the start till the end ) why did he need to edit his video and skip some kills ?!!!

- 2nd kill + 12 kill + 23rd kill was skipped from the video because it was suspecious that's why he didnt want to exposed.

- some of the players were carrying shields and hiding ( they were one shot ) so obviously when you are one shot and you have 50 shield you will take it instantly when you are hiding. I want to know how idropz knew their exact places where they were hiding and waiting from him to come and kill them.

- i've never rushed someone who has highground ans he knows that im coming and he didnt even try to shoot me down. 

- it was soooooo obvious when he rushed players who were in their bases and instead of shooting him they start building higher and far away from him so idropz can make them fall and die ( fall damage )

- 4 players were in their bases , and when idropz rushes them they gave up easly and went down giving him highground and when he starts shooting them 2 of them were just switching weapons and jumping.

- imagine 15 players of 24 kills didnt even try to shoot him back ( epic i need that lobby right now ) 

- you have to see the video before commenting. 

- im not the most stupid person to believe that game was a real show. sorry epic , you got robbed, and for me the winner is cloak ( im not his fan btw ).",FortNiteBR

These people are securing spots on the leaderboards by doing this all-day. This is becoming more widespread with the introduction of Nintendo Switch which people also use. Players that have 8 kd's with 6+ kills per match that are verified mobile server players are bragging their wins and stats when they earned them by pub-stomping a lobby of mobile players. 

Why should someone who plays a 3-man of console try-hards be allowed to earn wins counting towards leaderbaords against mobile players? I tried it out today and our first game of duo-squads we dropped 28. 

Now let me get this straight. I am in no way saying that people that play crosss platform with Nintendo Switch or Mobile or even PC should have their stats not count. Stats should count no matter what you are doing. I just have a problem with players grinding Switch and Mobile servers and achieving top 50 on the leaderless. 

TL;DR: Wins achieved in cross platform should not count towards leaderboards that are centered around a specific platform.

If you don't have explodes or an smg you're fucked. You should have sold the rights to your game a long time ago. The direction of your game clearly shows through the first 2 events you've put on. You have no grasp on what people want or how to manage your game.

-First tournament was a lag fest. Great server capabilities and preparation. What has all the billions of dollars you've made been funneled into?

-Second tournament was won by someone who didn't stream and now we can't see his gameplay. His stats don't add up to the performance that he put up and from the clips I did see he was launching to people that he someone knew exactly where they were and they happened to have 100 health and just holding onto shields and never shot back. If there was foul play you would 100% cover that up because the mockery of week 1, can't have something like that 2 weeks in a row.

-The gameplay has gone downhill. You've countered any skill based strategies by making explosives and smg's godlike. 

-The whole debacle with Sony locking accounts.. what if I break my PS4 and wanted to play on my Xbox. Well I guess I'm SOL and lost a couple hundred dollars because of your's and Sony's greed.

All you want to do is cater to below average players so they don't have to put in the time or effort to get kills or win games along with stuff your pockets with more money. It's a joke the direction your game is going, but hey at least there's cool skins. I know I'm gonna be downvoted to all hell but it's so disappointing seeing such an amazing game that I've put so much time into turn to shit. You're gonna lose big streamers, competitive players and a lot of casual players because your decision making team is subpar. That's probably why you've flooded so much money into the summer skirmish and invited so many streamers, give them an incentive to keep playing because the gameplay certainly isn't gonna keep people around for long. The reason people started and kept playing was because of the building, now if your opponent has a grenade launcher, C4 or and SMG (tommy gun included) then you can't outplay them with building. You have to hope you don't die from explosions and that bloom is in your favor during that fight.

People will eliminate your teammates just to make the game misrable for you and it lowers your chance of winning by a very big chunk, when youre just one player down.
A suggestion as to how this would work, could be that eliminated players have a 10 second timer, where if helped up by simply pressing e once on them, they return to their knocked state and are given another chance. This would incourage their teammates to rush and try to save their teammate.

This suggestion wasn’t the main focus of that post, so I wanted to give it some more attention. 

Many people are upset with the current state of explosives. Most will agree with the *idea* of lowering the explosive ammo cap and buffing damage to structures. 

The problem is that they may be *a bit* overbuffed at this point. 

Personally, I would hate to see the C4 go back to its original state. At the same time, I understand the frustration of a player with a 7 box wide 3-tower being completely destroyed by only 2 of them. 

Currently, **wood** is *by far* the most useful material in the game, due to its quick building speed.

Brick and metal are nice of course, but have a slower build time, and really only offer greater protection against small arms fire. Explosives are powerful enough to destroy them at generally the same rate. 

As a solution to the current issue of explosive strength, I propose Metal and Brick be buffed to block more of an explosives splash damage relative to Wood. It makes no sense that explosives penetrate Wood and Metal to the same degree.

This would incentivize the harvesting and use of stone and metal, which are currently undervalued in comparison to wood. It would also provide a significant buff to building, so that if a player prepares for it, they can create a base that offers somewhat more protection from explosives. 

I’m not a master-builder, and personally I’m not overly bothered by where explosives are at, but it’s noticeable that they went a little overboard with the buffs. I don’t think this is a good idea because I’m angry about explosives. 

I think this is a good idea because it would create much more dynamic gameplay, and add significant value to farming certain mats. ",FortNiteBR

2. Introducing more risk for taking far shots (more likely to miss).
3. Having luck save your life (bad reason).

5%- I like the power chord, and also have the vbucks/money I can spend, so I will buy it.

But now this is how the fortnite community is aware that the power chord is the rarest legendary skin:

90%: I now coincidentally love the power chord skin and am willing to spend 83829393 vbucks and open another credit card for it(but I swear it’s not cause of its rarity but I now love the skin)

5%: To be fair, I was going to buy the power chord but I would of been short on vbucks when the Raven came out(and I regret buying the Raven early because I could of bought the power chord and bought the Raven when it had come back to the shop the second or third time)

5%: I have the skin and wear it sometimes, but not cause I love it a lot, but just to flash how much of an og people will think I am when I 1v1 them or in the lobby or friends.

I’d respectively understand why the 5% percent would want to buy the power chord skin and would be cool with that and call it a day, but then everyone else who made fun of power chord and called it trash are going to be the same players who will deflate and crash the value of the power chord, become the default skin and end up refunding it because everyone will realize how plain the skin is and just start trashing it like when it was first released.

The vast majority want power chord because it’s rare, not because they like it. This is what’ll happen if it came back, they’ll be hyped, get vbucks and buy the skin, and a few hours later come on this sub and check the [rarity index spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vsascLSC9ynd6JFEgaIbolFPSYUXz-xgigvTjiANxkU/htmlview#) or the lobby and see how everyone now has the power chord skin and realized it’s not rare anymore and just wasted $20 on a skin they only liked because, wait for it, it was once rare.

I’m not saying that the power chord shouldn’t go back, it definitely should, but imo don’t buy the skin just because it’s a rare skin, but because you actually like it and don’t mind about the rarity of skins. Same goes for the rock out emote. Don’t buy it for the rarity, but because you like it and don’t mind the rarity aspect.",FortNiteBR

Here me out, to all the LMG fans (if any), I don’t hate this gun. But I do believe it is time to vault the LMG.

For starters, what is the purpose of it? Me personally, I don’t carry it long term because it wastes a lot of medium ammo that I’d rather use on assault rifles. It used to tear at the beginning of matches, but now with the new SMG meta, the buff, why would I grab one of these over a more easily acquirable SMG. Or the Drum Gun that uses the same ammo but is better than the LMG. Some may say it carries 100 ammo at a time it’s good at wrecking bases. But why use this to destroy bases when you can use the better minigun that doesn’t even reload?

Like I just see this gun now as a waste of space. I feel like it would be better off hitting the vault sooner rather than later. I’m not sure how many of you agree but let me know your thoughts on this gun! ",FortNiteBR

388,Barcaroli,1532291481,910s5j,16,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/910s5j/new_battle_pass_system_you_have_to_choose/,53,[New Battle Pass System] You have to choose different branches to follow (Like classes). Each branch with different skins and other rewards.,"TL;DR: Suggestion for a new Battle Pass system, with different branches to follow. As you choose your path throughout your Battle Pass, you get different rewards. 


At the beginning of every new season, the circle starts over, and you see everyone with the same skins.

That takes away much of the identity a cosmetic can provide. Take Drift as an example: A very nice looking skin but its recurrence over the lobbies makes it less enjoyable.

That also makes the Battle Pass very predictable. At the start of every season you know where things are going to end for everyone. It can get boring.

What if you need to choose which ""Branch"" or ""class"" to follow as you level up your Battle Pass?

In season 5, for example, you could have modern skins in a branch, and ancient skins on the other. And create sub branches with even more different rewards.

Of course Epic doesn't have to limit it to just a few choices. They can create multiple branches, each with a different purpose and story, its own emotes, dances, backblings, gliders and skins.

(And don't worry, you wouldn't have less rewards: at the end of a season you should have at least as much cosmetics and rewards as the current battle pass).

 This offers, in my perspective, several positive effects over the Battle Pa,ss.

The first and most obvious one is that it will create some sort of identity to your battlepass: as you choose your path throughout your battlepass, you get different rewards. This will create a diversity amongst your friends and the lobby in general.

It will also create more interactions with the battle pass. Depending on how well Epic works on this, choosing a branch can be a hard choice. One with rewards but also regreats. And people will discuss which is the best branch for as long as the season goes by.

Finally it will generate a sense of rarity on skins. Specially if this new Battle Pass system have multiple branches. If you choose a branch, you WILL be missing out on other skins and rewards, and those are not coming back. Pros and Cons, buddy.

Hey, if you want to get crazy, you can even create some requirements for certain branches. Like the challenges, but, you know, better. (By the way we could use some better challenges, couldn't we?)

Nowdays, the only alternative to the Battle Pass is the store. While I'm sure the store has financial benefits to Epic, I'm willing to bet a more interesting Battle Pass will get a lot of love from the community. They could even think about increasing the price, if the new Battle Pass is worth it.

What do you guys think? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

If you like the idea, please upvote so this can reach Epic.

I died to some of those of players, and while spectating them their movement seemed off. Imagine like a mobile player playing with PC players, but in reverse. 

I don’t really think that it’s fair for people to use their keyboard when playing against other players who are only using a controller. Playing with a mouse gives you so much more of an advantage when it comes to aiming. Not to mention, most of the best Fortnite players play on PC, which shows the limitations of playing a game using only a controller. 

This issue could easily be solved by completely removing keyboard and mouse support, or by redirecting keyboard and mouse users to a PC lobby. 

I know Fortnite isn’t PUBG, but back in April, PUBG commented on the use of third party devices on the Xbox, “Although usage of these devices is statistically very low, fair gameplay is core to our experience, and we will be communicating our plan to curb the use of these devices very soon”.

I'm still a srub but hear me out.  


\- First off, shotguns. They're balanced right now except for the pump. Heavy finally belongs to the legendary and epic categories and tac is pretty much for people who can't aim. As for the pump, it was suppose to be a weapon with high damage being offset by a slow rate of fire. Applying the deploy delay to the pump makes it worse but understandable to counter double pump. However, the recent update has destroyed double pump/shotguns so the pump deploy delay is unnecessary and meaningless. The pump has become useless and using the tac with ADS is better (imo).  
**TLDR: Please remove pump delay.**  


\- Second, SMGs. Implementing SMG buffs was a great way to try to discourage a shotguns meta. However, this has pretty much led to spam with the new SMG and the drum gun (which is an SMG, don't give me BS that's it's an assault rifle). Building has been torn to pieces by this kind of spam and with the combination of explosives, ""just build lol"" can no longer be countered by ""no u"" and can be countered with solid evidence of clips I've seen on this subreddit.  
**TLDR: Nerf something about SMGs and the drum gun.**

\-Explosives are my favorite type of weapons but even I'll admit it's a bit OP in its state right now. I think the C4 buff was needed to earn respect and the nerf with the amount of rocket ammo held was excellent. However, given SMG spam and the fact that explosives can now damage everything in a large splash radius, there's no counter to it except having a launch pad and getting the f\*ck out of there. Carrying 2 or more grenade launchers is also ridiculous because the grenades bounce randomly and the large splash radius pretty much negate building in the area until every last grenade explodes, taking you with it.  
**TLDR: Remove the huge splash radius and add in a delay if someone's holding multiple grenade launchers just like shotguns.**  


Since playing season 1, the most fun I've ever had was when building started to become popular. Building is a core aspect of the game and one of the few ways you can survive in fortnite. However, with spam and explosives as the current meta, I rather get double pump since I know the guy that killed me had to at least aim to get one good headshot instead of spraying and praying.   
Keep in mind, I'm still a scrub at this game despite playing almost everyday since season 1. Take my opinion with a grain of salt.

For those not clear enough, this meta is all based on SMG spraying, RPGs, grenade launchers and C4. Its the only thing you'll see mid-late game.

The purpose of this current meta is literally just to negate enemy building. This isn't what this game's about. Building is a core mechanic and sure, you can and should have counters to it but these counters are way too strong right now. You can't build for high ground now. Your structures will get melted and the problem is that you can't do anything about it.

Yes I agree the double shotgun wasn't so skillful either but the skill level for this SMG meta is laughable. You spray, you pray, and you win if the bloom goes in your favour. Accuracy won fights before, now it's who sprays the most. Imagine if they brought double shotguns back with the new consistent pellet spread update. The game would easily be at its best state.

The skill gap and the overall enjoyment of the game was so much better managed before Season 5. They have killed shotguns out of relevancy, and I really hope they make a return.

ATKs have a bug where if you ride it long enough you sort of desync and sit in place (ie Tfue dying in the summer skirmish). Exploits such as the fast farm method to farm materials faster. If you switch from meds to quick, the sound of it going off happens, and your blue/hp goes up, but immediately goes away. Sometimes you're unable to build if switching too fast.

Some guns have bloom that shouldn't. (Hunting rifle is one example), other guns shouldn't have such severe damage drop off (deagle, revolver), and explosives need a nerf of their damage radius (my opinion).

Another opinion of mine would be to return the damage drop off of shots to building.

Fortnite has been on the Nintendo Switch for over a month, and while it’s an amazing game, it’s almost as if Epic doesn’t want us to play it. The lack of support for the console simply isn’t fair to those who have invested money into the game and expect to enjoy it in full on the Switch just as players on other consoles do. For example, there is still no stats page, and feats achieved on Switch (such as wins and eliminations) don’t update the stats pages on the other consoles. It’s almost as if achievements on the Switch are treated as not relevant enough to be included in the tally of things achieved elsewhere. This is very discouraging for Switch players trying to play with their friends on other consoles; after getting a win, the other players can enjoy seeing their stats updated with their new achievement, while for the Switch player, nothing ever happened. They still participated in the victory, but it’s as if they didn’t. 

The most egregious example of the Switch being undersupported is the V-Bucks issue. V-Bucks on an account shared between Switch and another console do not switch (hee hee) between consoles. For example, if you were to buy 1,000 V-Bucks on your Switch, then 1,000 V-Bucks on your Xbox, all on the same account, you would not have 2,000 V-Bucks to spend. You would have 1,000 and 1,000. It is a great annoyance to see something you want in the Items shop and enough V-Bucks on your account, but have them spread between consoles so that you can’t get the item without buying more V-Bucks, even though you have enough. 

You may say, “Well why don’t you just buy all your V-Bucks on one account, dummy?” While I agree with this, it’s not always that simple. Using myself as an example, I don’t buy V-Bucks outside of what I use on the Battle Pass. I don’t like to spend more money than I have to, and I don’t really have the money to throw around on extra skins besides the fun I have getting the ones o the Battle Pass. I only buy extra items with the V-Bucks I earn on the Battle Pass, so it’s important to maximize how many V-Bucks I get off of it. Unfortunately, it is very easy to forget what tier you’re creeping up on and accidentally earn 100-200 V-Bucks on the console you aren’t using for V-Buck storage. 

For example, I recently decided to play some Fortnite on my Switch, and in my first game I reached a tier that gave me 200 free V-Bucks! Yay! Unfortunately, I have 800 V-Bucks on my Xbox, and now only 200 on my Switch. I have enough to get a 1,000 V-Bucks item, but it’s spread out between consoles so I can’t do it. I won’t get 200 more V-Bucks on my Xbox in time before the item leaves the shop, so I therefore have to spend money on V-Bucks that I have already paid for in order to get the item in time. This is very damaging to the fun of Fortnite, because I often have to avoid using certain weapons on the Switch in an attempt to not get to the next tier and waste more V-Bucks. 

If you’ve read this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to my dumb complaints, but I really think these issues need to be examined. Epic, I love Fortnite and I’m so grateful to you for letting me play it on the Switch. It’s allowed my brother and me to play together for the first time without having to squabble over whose turn it is on the Xbox, and has been a real blast besides these issues. I know PlayStation players have a lot more issues involving cross-platform than we Switch players do, but it would be great for the whole Fortnite community if we could be more connected to it.

TL;DR Switch Fortnite is great, but not having a Stats page and splitting V-Bucks between consoles are real issues that take away from the gameplay experience and need to be looked at.",FortNiteBR

Sure smgs might have a little more rng especially mid range but even the old shotguns had rng. Unless you’re just standing still letting someone laser your head then smgs actually require aim and tracking about the same as a shotgun.

Think about this shit, I used to *maybe* carry around a tac smg, then they buffed the shit out of the suppressed sub.  Okay, that's fine, I can roll double shotgun suppressed sub which is pretty dope and not too OP cuz of the fire rate.  But uh oh, here comes the drum gun, a gun which completely replaces the suppressed sub with increased fire rate, damage, and larger mag size.  That's fine, whatever, just means more people will be running spray loadouts...... but wait a minute, Epic has an idea, how about... another smg?  An smg that replaces the tac sub, has a very high spawn rate, insanely high rate of fire, and superior spread to the tac sub.  Now wait, double pump is gone, explosives are buffed, and spraying weapons are at their prime?  This game is turning into a game of ""who can blow up the enemies base and fire aggressively at them until they die first"".  I was an avid user of double pump, and while many people may argue against this, I believe double pump required skill.  And yea, while shotguns may still require skill, even more skill now, you know what doesn't require any skill and can shred through basically anyone if you're slightly lucky?  SMGs and explosives can, and it's absolutely ridiculous.  Now, Epic is adding another smg, one that seemingly will be better than any others in the game.  I mean, come on, this isn't even a game of skill anymore!  I've had countless games end in recent days due to someone just spraying their heart out on me then just walking away as if nothing happened.  I miss cool kills, I miss skill based kills, everyone has been complaining about fortnite being too RNG based for a few months, and this is just making it more RNG based!  With the low rarity of the suppressed smg the smg and the drum gun, it is almost guaranteed that you'll come across someone who is just spraying and praying their way to victory every game, and it works!  I'm terrified for the day the new smg is released, and frankly, if you're not and you don't wanna take action against it, the game is only gonna get worse.

Also I'm typing it on mobile so the formatting might be subpar.

We all know that not having Mats endgame is a struggle, and it's been happening more recently than it has in a while. This is mostly attributed to material nerfs and people just getting better and building more; but it can also be traced to the fact that the below average player has no incentive to farm more than 200-300 Mats, because they simply don't build as often as more experienced players.

My proposed solution is to give *XP* to players who farm. ***Here's a breakdown:***

**Wood**: Every *125* wood you farm, you get *1 XP*, capping at *10 XP* received, or *1,250* wood farmed.

**Brick**: Every *75* brick you farm, you get *2 XP*, capping at *12 XP*, or *900* brick farmed.

**Metal**: Every *50* metal you farm, you get *3 XP*, capping at *15 XP*, or *250* metal farmed.

It should be noted that you will **ONLY** get the XP when you yourself are farming the mats, **NOT** from just picking them up. Also, you **SHOULD** still be able to receive the XP even when you have max materials.

This should be *relatively*^maybe easy to implement because they already have a stat for tracking how much materials you've farmed, as seen in the S4 free pass for farming them.

It absolutely shreds any guy and from medium distance, let's say max 50-60m, it will slay any 'noob' still using an AR, and he will have no chance of defending unless he's got one as well. The firepower+firerate is so high that it penetrates the enemy and he wont even get a chance to react. 

Now, the reason I'm posting this is to try to get as much karma as possible /s. But on a serious note, I am scared of what the new P90 will do and hope it won't replace the AR for good. Leave me your feedback and what you think about this whole situation.



TL;DR: SMG is currently a bit OP, and shreds any player from a certain distance. Unfortunately some won't get a chance to react to that, and I think in some cases when versing a player using the new SMG you NEED to have it, otherwise you'll get de_stroyed.",FortNiteBR

I average 1-2 kills per game . Anytime I see someone and start shooting at them they start building like crazy and rush me. Its very hard to build in that situation. I start spamming random buttons on my keyboard and end up with an emote. My aim isn't bad in this game the problem is building . How do you learn to build in the game. In almost every encounter all I'm able to build is a wall and a ramp and by the time I'm done my opponent has built a 4 storeyed structure and a few seconds later I'm dead. Any tips and help would be appreciated. Thanks ,FortNiteBR

Is it just me or does the gun actually have bloom even when scoped? I often miss while moving and firing so I'm starting to think this is the case. Can someone do some in depth testing on this?,FortNiteBR

The first things that spring to mind are:

* Find meds
* Crouch walk
* Don't engage
* Engage someone you *know* can kill to grab their loot/heals.

Other than that, i'm not sure how to fight back ?",FortNiteBR

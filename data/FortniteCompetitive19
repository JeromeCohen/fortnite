I play casually but in a competitive manner. I'm at about 200 pts now and I love the fact that I match against players who are at my skill level. Sure there are a few bots and few super good players at times in the lobby, but generally speaking, I see people making the same mistakes I make, miss their shots, give up high ground, peak at bad times etc.. It only helps me get better because I see that mistake and also see what they could of done better to actually kill me. I am sure they also feel similar when they die to me or get killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think best way to get better is to play against similarly skilled players. not bots, not super good players. Because those battles end too quick..with no work arounds/creativity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing I think we need is higher bus fare and dropping down divisions. I certainly wouldn't want to keep playing this mode in champs if I am not good enough. ",FortniteCompetitive

This is exactly what’s happened: comp has more lower level and intermediate players, and Pubs has had a noticeable reduction in completely dominant PubStompers relative to the week before when the 1week tourney was going. This is clearly exactly the change that epic desired and has certainly reduced the sweatiness of Pubs and increased engagement in Comp. I’m not sure why bad and average players are clamouring for its return when it benefits them. I do see why higher level players complain as it makes PubStomping high kill games higher, but reverting it (at least the health portion) would probably be detrimental to the long term future of the game. 
I do think a boost to farming would be beneficial however, +\- the mats on kill. ",FortniteCompetitive

I have edited for language to keep to the point and not get deleted, so enjoy a good laugh at my family friendly edits 😊

I kept this as complete as possible even though there was some repetition as I think some people have just seen a 30 second clip and thought he was being sarcastic. I have bolded the key takeaways.

&amp;#x200B;

**“I think this last update was healthy for the game”**

&amp;#x200B;

\*chat can’t tell if he is joking\*

&amp;#x200B;

“Bro, I hate almost every single update, and I honestly think this is the only good one they’ve done, straight up. I just think they need to do something about the balls now”

&amp;#x200B;

\*chat still thinks he is trolling\*

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m not even trolling. I literally said that was stupid before they added it, that *stuff* does not belong in public games at all.”

&amp;#x200B;

“The only people that are going to complain about it are the people that are getting hit. Listen buddy, why don’t you get good at the game and not get hit? Then you don’t have to deal with it, ok? If you complain about mats just don’t build; that’s what I do, people are just *dookie* dude.” \*/s this statement was made in a clearly sarcastic tone\*

&amp;#x200B;

“Bro, **I want nothing but longevity for this game. Reverting that was probably the best thing they could have done for the game. People that want health and mats per kill are people that want the game to die. That’s nothing but facts and I’m not trolling.** **I think Epic messed up big time, I think they should have never added mats and heath per kill. They should have never added it, because now people are so used to it they take it away and people don’t know how to play the game. Bro, this is a** ***freaking*** **battle royale dude this isn’t** ***freaking*** **team deathmatch bro, you feel me? People need to understand that.** Go into creative and play deathmatch dude.”

&amp;#x200B;

\*reads chat\* “everyone’s agreeing with my opinion”

&amp;#x200B;

“Bro people are just dumb. I’ve been playing battle royales for so *freaking* long like I know what is good for the game and what is not good for the game. It is simple bro, I literally was there when H1 started, I was there when PUBG stated, I was here when Fortnite started. This isn’t my first rodeo dude. All these people that have never played a BR before in their *freaking* life, they don’t know how games even work. They are like “dude I just want to hold W the whole game.” No. This isn’t *freaking* Call of Duty . You are stupid. **I feel like mats per kill and shield per kill definitely belong in competitive dude that’s a no brainer. That totally makes sense. But in regular pubs it is stupid, it is dumb, and it will kill the game. I think that Fortnite was stupid for adding it in the first place** because when they take it away people are going to be mad butt hurt. If they just never added it in the first place it wouldn’t be an issue, **but they realized they*****messed*** **up and obviously it’s better to take it out now than never. Better late than never.** People are just stupid dude, I see all this *stuff* on twitter, like c’mon dude.

&amp;#x200B;

**“As much as I get mad when bots kill me, like ill get** ***pooped*** **on by** ***freaking*** **like timmy73969ttv dude, and I’m pissed at the time but at the end of the day that guy** ***pooped*** **on me and he had fun** ***pooping*** **on me and that’s healthy for the game. At the end of the day if a bot** ***poops*** **on me dude and he had fun then we chillin’ dude.”**

&amp;#x200B;

**“There are two types of streamers: there are the people that want to see the game die and then people that want to see the game have a long healthy successful life. That’s why you see me late game letting these** ***crappy*** **players win dude because** **I want them to have a good time and I want them to keep playing the game and I want them to use my Fortnite support a creator code in the item shop!** *C’mon* bro. Some people are just so dumb its insane. I’ll literally watch someone stream and they will have the biggest bot ever in a 1v1 and they will just *poop* on the dude. They will bully the dude and *poop* on the dude. At least when I bully people, most of the time, like I’ll let them *freaking* win. **People just want to beat this game into the ground just like every other game.”**

&amp;#x200B;

**\*falls and dies to fall damage with a scar\*** **“Dude, honestly I hope a bot gets my scar and** ***messes*** **that lobby up bro, lets go!”**

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Tfue thinks mats per kill and shield per kill in pubs is not healthy for the game. This is because without these bots have a higher chance at success in game. Bots playing Fortnite, enjoying it, and sticking with it is how Fortnite has a long and successful lifespan. He thinks the streamers who are disagreeing with this are shortsighted and not considering the overall health of the player base.",FortniteCompetitive

So long story short I've been playing since S2 from Xbox one, to PS4, and now to PC just because I needed a computer. Lately it is extremely demotivating to play on the PS4 because of how buggy/glitchy it has been. I've been literally on just the brink of quitting overall. So I finally saved up for a gaming laptop which i needed since I didn't have a computer in general. Then at the point I figured hey might as well see how the game feels compared to console, and........WOW. FN literally feels like a new game. So like any anyone else if I die to someone too good i respect that, note it and move on. I HATE when I die because wanted to edit/build or move then it freezes/glitches. It happens so much less on PC literally if any compared to console so far. I noticed how significantly less frustrated I have been playing on PC just because how much cleaner, and crisp it runs. Also it feels so much better competing in the cups now. The only downside is I've gone down stats from a 3 to roughly 2.5KD since switching i think just because there is a higher skill range. Now I'm only a bit hesitant now to make the full move over to KB&amp;M just because I have been playing controller games for so long.  So for any console players thinking about switching in the future just to reassure you........ IT IS WELL WORTH IT. Really made me love the game again. Cheers!",FortniteCompetitive

In order to force them to play arena, they made pubs nearly unplayable/much less enjoyable for everyone in the game. What Epic should do is to improve the experience of playing Arena by decreasing the amount of RNG and getting rid of things that are detrimental to the end-game, such as the baller. Another thing they could do to encourage people to play Arena modes would be to reward players for improving and moving up divisions with v-buck rewards or skins for hitting landmark divisions. This would encourage people to play Arena because they enjoy it, not because it's the only mode that they can play without having a bad experience by getting bad RNG early game, then doing nothing but farming mats until the end game.

Please forgive me but none of my friends play so I don’t really get to talk about competitive Fortnite much, if at all. Downvote for a shit post if you want, I couldn’t possibly care less. 

I switched from a standard Xbox controller to elite controller 3.5 weeks ago after playing on a standard controller since late season 2. I thought I was “decent” at the game, accumulating a 10% lifetime win percentage in solo (the only game mode I play) with close to 300 wins. In reality, I had been a bot the whole time. My highest kill win was an 8 bomb...

Once syphon mode was added back in to pubs, I finally decided I wanted to “stomp” and not play so passively anymore, going only for 2-6 kill royales so I made the switch to the elite controller and I can’t even begin to describe how much of a game changer it is. There is no doubt a learning curve but after a few days I felt like I was hitting my stride. A few days later I dropped my first 11 kill win (pathetic I know since I’ve been playing since S2). The difference in using paddles vs playing non-claw with incredibly extremely prohibitive button binds is hard to describe if you haven’t given it a chance. 

I also purchased a 60hz monitor which was a huge upgrade to the 5 year old 40 inch TV I had been using prior. This also allowed me to sit closer to the monitor which has made a tremendous improvement to my aim. I couldn’t recommend buying one (only cost me about £85) if you are a fellow console player using a crappy tv. 

Have managed to get up to 207 points so far in arena mode via solos only. This is my first attempt at competitive tournaments as I never felt worthy or capable enough to give it a go but it’s nice to be able to hang around so far in the tournament! Good luck everyone ",FortniteCompetitive

The current system might work for a while because it's new and players haven't settled but this isn't a stable state and I'd argue that the arena isn't actually ranked at all and only functions as an elaborate timegate into division five (currently approximating ""ranked"").

I think arena should be set up so that if you are an average player in your division, you stay in your division. If you are better than average, you should move up in the long run and if you are worse than average you should move down. Currently the max number of points dealt out in match is 118 points for placement + 1 per kill so a maximum of 217 and in practice probably a bit above 200. So an average player (in the division) is expected to net a tad above 2 points. Thus any bus fare under 2 will eventually result in the average player ranking up due to point inflation.

As average players in a division constantly go up in rank, that will make the higher division less skilled in the long run (if we exclude new player influx in our analysis). Eventually almost everyone will be juggling between divisions five and six.

The vast majority in division seven is expected to de-rank quickly and also most in division six although not as quickly. This will push almost all players eventually in division five and will corrupt the whole point in ranked.

(The highest tier needs to lose more points on average than it gains. So division 7 should have a bus fare of 3-4 points)

I have a hunch that Epic might have implemented this to ensure that higher divisions have enough players right of the bat at it would take considerably more time to fill them with enough players (and thus increasing queue times) with the increased bus fare in lower divisions. This will eventually bite them in the ass if they don't introduce higher bus fares for lower divisions.

87,JWPapi,1554108298,b7zlbk,101,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b7zlbk/real_explanation_why_the_competitive_system_is/,200,Real Explanation why the competitive system is not competitive,"I'm gonna start with a **tldr,** because it will be easier than to understand my following points:

&amp;#x200B;

**A competitive system should not be just here to determine the best players, but it should be a way to measure a players skill on all levels. The current system fails for this completely. High Points in Arena in Gauntlet or in Arena means nothing except that you grinded a lot and sit in a hamster ball.** 

I think almost everybody who is patient enough to play lame as fuck can amount it to a tremendously amount of points, since there will always be players that play not play competitively and just wkey for fun. As again points are more of a hours played measure than a skill measure. This was different for the pop up cups.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just the beginning tho. I think EPIC really think they should change the person who is designing the ranked and competitively mode. There are so many flaws in it, that it is tough for me to list all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- That you can't below 0 points. I see reasons for that but it turned out that in most games like chess or other games it never worked out, because of the inflation of points distributed to the system =&gt; Solution start with points and pay in for games. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- It gets even worse. You can't loose points in 3!! divisions. There are sooo many points created every game, supporting the grind factor. Sooner or later everybody will make it. Solution =&gt; Make like one entrance division to join the league and start fresh from it after. Don't let those point influence the other points.

&amp;#x200B;

\-4th division it makes way more sense to play duos then solos since the net generation of points is ( 100 people pay  (-1) + 200 elimination points(every elimination times 2) + 100 elim points = 200 + points per game , but solos just give + 100  since not every elimination gives 2 points ( to both partners)

&amp;#x200B;

\-5th division wtf its way better to play solos now since you pay 2 in duos leading to a net 50 per game and a net 100 again for the solos. To put that into perspective, we still generate +25% and +50% of points per game, this is super inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-6th division is the only kinda fair division, since the net points are generated are about equal

&amp;#x200B;

\-7th division is designed to have no games. If points will be really worth anything a lot of people shouldnt play it, since your average should be making 4 points in duos and 3 in solos. We have net -100 in both duos and solos. It might be slightly better with 80ppl lobbies. However if people care about there points there shouldnt be games.

&amp;#x200B;

\- YOU can not move down. Once in Champion you will loose 4 points per game as a duo and 3 as a solo forever. That means if your I would guess not in the top 1000 players of your region you will loose points forever till you eventually gone to 0.

&amp;#x200B;

\- ++ Patience in Hamsterballs is not a measure of skill for me

&amp;#x200B;

\- Arena Points as a measure of skill is completely inefficient for ALL Levels

&amp;#x200B;

\- Pop Up Cups were a measure of skill. You could try to beat your own high score all the time and had a chance to evaluate your skill level. The downside was it was just 30 games and 5 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

=&gt; I dont have the perfect solution, but I think we are going into the completely wrong direction, we don't want a grind game which rewards who is playing the most. I can just play farm simulator meanwhile. Right now I'm feeding my competitive spirit by beating my times in edit courses and records in Kovaaks, since unfortunately there is nothing except the 10 games only luxe cup which measures my baller qualities.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should split solo and duo days again to make it easier to pair equally skilled lobbies and queue times have to get higher at a specific level, right now its definitely too broad! And Please don't create and inflationary point system.",FortniteCompetitive

Just an opinion. (almost me just venting and letting others know what happen if you take it too seriously when you're at this average to above-average level.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an above average console player who likes the settings on ranked. In console pubs, I'll win about 10% of the time with 5 - 7 kills. I've never gotten more than 10 points in a pop-up and actually stopped doing them back in December because I was getting mad at how I couldn't get past 10 points. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to get it out of the way, I have no intention in trying in any of these tournaments or for money. I just like the siphon rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've obviously gotten better than December but not anywhere close where I should be with almost 200 points. I'm good at rotating and third-partying.   I know that sounds like bitchy things to be good at but I promise I'm not hiding in a bush or even in a baller the whole game.  I can shoot well (thank you COD) and building is good for console level but once you throw editing and multi-person fights in there, I'm done.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at the point now in Arena where as soon as see a person I know I'm dead though. I reached that 175 points (think that's division 6) and can easily tell a difference in the players now. I'm getting scroll wheeled on and editing 5 layers down there 90 like Symfuhny and can tell I'm getting laughed at on their side lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly was fine with Arena and doing well until around 100 then just went entirely for placement after that. Still landing Paradise or Happy and contesting it but once the first circle closes, I'm usually already in top 25 and close to getting top 15. I thought I was doing well and gaining all these points and now I just feel like I'm getting shit on at this new division. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should get better and working on it. But I've never scrimmed in my life, only edit to get out of a 1 by 1, never done turtle wars or that other crap and obviously playing on PS4 doesn't help. I've actually never even 1-1 someone in playground or whatever. Most I do is warm-up courses and practicing builds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly if I could go back, I wouldn't have tried my hardest to get up in arena for no reason.  I'll land now and 1 out of every 10 games, I'll make it out of my POI and get 3-6 points and then go in a circle. I honestly think bus fare should be more at this level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: the only ""good"" thing that came out of this is now I feel like my console pubs are too easy. Played pub duos with a friend (he's really bad) and I was getting 10+ kills a game and it wasn't even close to fair. It wasn't like that before but now I feel like I can't even practice my gameplay in my pubs now either :/

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm kinda in this weird spot where I'm just gonna get laughed at at my level in Arenas, pubs is boring and also won't help me progress at all, and I only play at the most an hour a day so I feel like turtle wars and scrims would be more annoying than anything because I'll play one and then have to get off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda just wondering if anyone else is in my situation? Not good enough for Arenas anymore but bored and silly to do pubs for longer than a couple games. Kinda wish I could restart my progress in ranked or something. ",FortniteCompetitive

1.Saf and Zayt. I put them above Zex and Vinny due to the fact that in the most competitive tourney ever, they came out on top.

2. Zex and Vinny. 3rd place at katowice and TwitchCon. I wouldn't be suprised if they end up being better than saf and zayt, but im putting TSM 2nd for right now.

3.Aspect and Animal. They were 7th at katowice, but what really sets them apart is their placings in the recent cups. There style of agression is great in the new scoring system, and I would be SHOCKED to see them not at worlds. Out of all these 3, I would put them at most likely to qualify for worlds,then tsm, than Saf and Zayt. Sentiniels are sooo underrated.

Honorable Mentions

Bizzle and Dmo: Good, but the placements aren't as good as the others

72 and vivid: We haven't seen much of them yet, (due to them not streaming as much)but theoretically this duo should be amazing. They also seem to be more concerned with comp. then their streams. Look out for this duo!

Tfue and Cloak: They got 1st at TC, but seem to be focusing more on their streams that comp. I'm not saying they aren't competitive players, I'm just saying they care more about their streams.

* Reverted Material farm rate and materials dropped on kill to a pre-patch 8.20 state in all game modes. 
* Reverted 3000 material cap to 1500
* Added an adjusted form of health per kill to all public matches.
   * kills will now grant 50 healing, but with a maximum of 25 to shield and 25 to health, this will help prevent snowballing, while also still granting a means of surviving after battling multiple enemies.
   * In duo and squad modes, knocking an opponent will apply health as the opponent bleeds out, 1 health per tick of bleed damage. (u/Jyp\_C) This will still apply a maximum of 25 shield and 25 health.
* Removed individual ammo spawns from floor loot.
   * spawn rates for weapons have been adjusted to take the place of ammo. 
* Adjusted pull out time for all shotguns to match the faster pull out rate of the purple and gold pump shotguns prior to update 8.20.
* Added a ready indicator for all guns.
   * works exactly like the delay indicator when switching between shotguns. 
   * will provide feedback for players switching to a pump shotgun and not being able to shoot. 
* Increased the range of the tactical shotgun to more accurately reflect its heavy variant. 
   * Previously tactical shotguns were always beaten out by a pump shotgun. This should allow both variants to be viable and used in different ways.
* Editing a structure to break down an opponent now properly grants kill credit. 
* Cannons now work properly
   * direction facing will be accurately displayed on the map
   * turning the cannon will now properly shoot you in the direction you are facing
* Infinite dab duration in lobby is now *actually* infinite.
* Added ability to disable pre-editing in settings
   * reworked editing to preferentially edit the structure you are looking at regardless of which build is selected.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Audio Changes**:
   * Added a unique wall break sound effects to player owned walls near the player. 
      * This should allow players to gain more audio feedback about the builds that are protecting them, without polluting the overall audio quality with constant wall breaking effects. 
   * Audio clipping now properly prioritizes audio inputs. 
      * Footsteps &gt; Wall Breaking &gt; gunshots &gt; building placement &gt; Audio queues (clinger beep, trap place etc.) &gt; Explosions &gt; Vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Performance/Stability:** 
   * Removed 0.15s turbo build delay again. 
      * Steve accidentally put it back in. Steve is now fired. 
      * Our intent initially with this change was to slow down the pace of the game slightly, however the resulting effect was further exasperation of high ping and causing players to be unable to defend themselves right after shooting.
      * 0.15s delay will remain while swinging the pickaxe. Wall replacing will still be possible when shooting a wall, but will allow for more consistent and predictable counterplay when turbo building to defend yourself. 
   * Added option for Console players to disable shadows! 
      * Blame Steve that this wasn't added earlier.
   * Fixed a bug causing traps to place in unintended locations.
   * Added a 'Buffer' zone to the edit tiles. 
      * Gaps between edit tiles will now be clickable as extensions of the outer tiles. This should make editing feel more consistent without reducing the 'skill' aspect of editing.
   * switching weapons right before picking up an item will no longer replace the wrong item in the players inventory.
   * enemy walls will no longer incorrectly display the option to edit. 
   * Ghost hit markers:
      * Added a new system to properly track hit markers.
      * when enemy has placed a build which has not registered on the players screen, hit markers will no longer be displayed for the shooting player
      * when an enemy is running and goes behind cover, damage from the player shooting will always be prioritized. 
   * Phasing rework:
      * Players will no longer phase through ramps and instead will slide to the side which the majority of their body is on
      * Players will no longer phase through floors when only their head is near or touching the bottom. At least 20% of the player model must be through the floor to initiate phasing. 
      * Pushback on walls will now preferentially move players away from each other, preventing players from over abusing wall phasing to push into other players builds. 
   * Multiple performance changes:
      * changed how player builds are rendered while in the storm to make unusable builds much less compute intensive
      * fixed an issue causing random spikes in ping
      * Implemented optimization changes which should allow players to see FPS increases across the board. FPS for players on console and on mid-range PCs has drastically decreased each season, this should help to make the game perform as well as it once did on mid to low end hardware.
      * fixed issue causing textures to not load properly on console. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Arena Mode:

* Removed some fun, but non-competitive items from the arena playlist.
   * Ballers
   * Heavy Sniper
   * Turret
   * Thermal Scoped Assault Rifle
   * Rift-to-go
      * While the Rift-to-go is highly utilized in competitive playlists, it creates a specific playstyle where players who are carrying a Rift-to-go are able to take much greater risks or avoid risks all together. 
      * Adjusted launch pad drop rate to compensate. 
* Adjusted loot pool to only spawn uncommon rarity or better weapons in this mode.
* Materials (50/50/50) will now enter a player's inventory automatically upon killing an opponent.

&amp;#x200B;

* Future updates will attempt to improve competitive integrity and mitigate the effect of early game RNG, however we are waiting until after the World Cup to test and implement these changes.
   * All players will now drop in carrying a grey pistol.
   * We will test the removal of all vehicles, as they can sometimes artificially inflate the number of players end-game contributing to lag. 
   * removing certain items with no counter play such as rocket launchers and snipers. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Every player spawns in with 200 health - reduces RNG.

2) Med kit time is lowered to 7 seconds.

3) Decrease small pot to white and shield potion to green rarity.

4) Decrease the revive timer - make squads playable again.

5) Spawn with 150 mats.

6) Add a respawn feature for squads, wiping a squad to leave yourself alone with no health and quitting the game is getting boring.

&amp;#x200B;

Arena modes - being completely honest this was the biggest disappointment in my eyes

1) Add trios.

2) Let us see our stats in a HUB tab.

3) Have a league - you play 15 games - you need a minimum amount of points to maintain your position in the division - if you don't reach that minimum you get demoted - likewise if you exceed a set point total you get promoted - along with that if you reach an even higher point total in them 15 games you receive a pin or something to actually show your achievement.

This initial test will allow anyone on PC the ability to grab, and view the full replays of some of the high intensity matches that occur during the Luxe Cup. We’re excited to see VoD reviews, montages, highlights, and other creative content from the community during this first public test. 

Replay files of every Luxe Cup match this weekend will be added to the Google Sheets below. (Please note, as these files are quite large, they may take some time to load).

Anyone is able to tune into these matches for their own content; simply save the desired available match replay to the replay folder. Follow the guide below to get started:

* Click on the desired replay file from within one of the sheets above.
* This will open a browser tab, which will start an automatic download of the replay file.
* Navigate in-game to the “Career” tab then “Replays”.
* Click on “Open Replay Folder” button at the bottom right to bring up File Explorer and the replay folder.
* Move the downloaded replay file from Step 2 into the folder opened in Step 4.
* The replay should now be able to be played in-game, by going to “Career” then “Replays” on the main menu within Fortnite Battle Royale.

Remember, our replay tools are still a work in progress and have some wet paint, so please give us your feedback as we work to polish and add features over the next few iterations. We’ll continue to add more replay files here as the Luxe Cup progresses, and will have more replay links available on an upcoming blog post early next week!

I have a ryzen 1600x and a gtx 1070. My question is, for anyone who understands well enough how this works, why are both my chips operation at only 40% when my frames are suffering?

I was expect CPU or gpu to be a bottleneck, like one at 90% and one at 40% or something, but they both operate lower than 50% at all times, BEIN LAZY.

Anybody with experience know what's going on here?

For what it's worth, I tested my PC on a benchmark software, and compared to other 1600x and 1070s, they both performed in the bottom 25%. I was fine with that, but I don't understand why they aren't using their full potential. Am I missing something? Or is there something I should fix?

If you havent watched any of the stream yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's a huge step forward.

Hadn't seen much about this on the sub, but just wanted to encourage anyone that hasn't already to at least peak in and watch some of the stream on the official Fortnite twitch channel. 

Out of nowhere Epic has taken the same spectator system used at LAN events and now has it able to switch seamlessly between different ongoing matches one after the other. That they have now expanded the spectator client to be able to tap into these online qualifiers and tournaments live seems like an awesome initiative and step in the right direction. 

At the same time Epic is showcasing this, Twitch has also released their ""Squad Streaming"" capabilities. I wont speak too much on this, other than to say I think its INCREDIBLE software development, and a huge step for esports and streamers as a whole. I dont know whether Epic was involved in the process in any way, but it appears as though they have already incorporated it into their livestream. While not providing the viewers the squad stream option, they have shown several live segments where the screens are staggered in the same 3 tile manner, and shows the overall action in the main screen while focusing closer on individual action between two teams in the other tiles. Not only that but the casters have several times made comments such as ""let's see if we can get a view of what's going on from up top"" or ""let's close in to watch this action"" and the stream almost immediately fulfills the casters requests. 

Having the casters able to request the footage live is a major upgrade from previous endeavors, wherein the camera would change action without notice and may end up showing a team sitting in a box instead of 2 teams actively fighting. 

Overall, Bravo. Plenty of improvements still to be made, and I'm in no way trying to ignore others missteps on Epics behalf. However I think it's worth appreciating steps like this that are taken, that vastly improve the spectator experience and provide a product that shows they are learning and striving to improve.",FortniteCompetitive

So there should be more room for being accurate. This was done on xBeak's new map:  1624-1148-8943 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried mouse as well which I will explain in the ""Explanation"" section.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem:** Fortnite ramps their stick acceleration exponentially, which makes flicks incredibly inconsistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explanation:** To better illustrate what I am talking about here is a screenshot from Apex Legends: [https://imgur.com/a/TxsVJDH](https://imgur.com/a/TxsVJDH)

If you look at the bottom right, you can see that the graph is not a straight line. If it was, if you move your stick 40% of the way, you can expect your speed to be 40% of your maximum. If you move it 80% of the way, the speed will be 80% etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Going off of that graph, moving your stick 50% of the way, gives you about 20% of your max speed. Speed is the Y-axis, your stick movement is you X-axis. The line starts late because of his deadzone setting but the point still applies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fortnite's curve won't match that graph exactly but it is still exponential. This is somewhat similar to mouse acceleration on mouse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plugged in a mouse (sens was put at 0.06 at what I am assuming is 800 dpi) and after a few seconds I was already more consistent than controller. Literally no joke. Controller aim is good when the targets are near each other but once you need to flick, the exponential curve will cause you to overflick. Same applies for mouse acceleration. 

**Solution:** Either give us something akin to Apex's incredible aim settings or give us a simple ""Response Curve"" setting that has exponential (which can be called Classic) and linear as its two options. 

Best solution would be both lol.

Land medium drops, farm mats, loot heals, play for end-game and don’t fall asleep even though it’s a god damn snooze-fest.

Temporarily stop going hot drops. It will only confirm that their changes worked. We, the higher skilled players, are killing eachother early game leaving bots a chance to win.

Disengage a good player and only fight if you have to. Double ramp a low-skilled with unhealthy amounts of aggression to intimidate them.

\-Balloons &lt; DONT BELONG IN COMPETITIVE what the hell man if I drop L's at tilted and get balloons and my opponent in the other L gets blue pump 100 shield. WOW! He has SO MUCH MORE SKILL THEN ME!!! I sure did learn a lot! Ill definitely do something better next time and improve!

\- Ballers &lt; DONT BELONG IN COMPETITIVE Hey lets just all avoid each other and fly around and hide for points going EZ mode and abusing the momentum to shotgun people flying past in unpredictable movements.  
(example [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b7bty3/challenging\_endgames\_be\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b7bty3/challenging_endgames_be_like/) )  
\^Scrims shouldnt be like this. What kind of game are we playing? Pinball?????? literally the worst gameplay what were you thinking Epic. the only reason people arent complaining as bad as the planes or boombox's is because its a PASSIVE issue. So everyone can abuse it passively So even though its pissing people off there just doing it back to feel ok about it. its not cool. Everyone I know says the same thing, They dont belong but they have to use them cause other people are doing it for points and it works.   


\- ITEM RARITIES &lt; DONT BELONG IN COMPETITIVE, either they are all purple or blue or nerf them to be inbetween so everyone is at the same grade of weapons. its already BS that my enemy has a pump and i get a pistol now you want to give him a blue or gold variant while i have grey? Yeah sick meta dude. ESPORTS READY! after I lost that fight I definitely thought off what I could have done differently!! outpeak him 10 times and get that headshot with out getting hit once!!? roiiight....... Thanks for showing me how to improve!!! (- begs the next chest for better loot-) &lt;&lt; thats about all I learned.  


\-Weapon Spawns &lt; FIX!!!! another example because its the best example I can think of; is the L's at tilted; one of them will have 2 pumps and the other has none. im not saying make the same spawn points, we dont want it like halo where everyones fighting for a house that has specific loot. but houses near each other should have close to or very similar loot. H1Z1 did this best by putting ARS and AKS everywhere now I understand its a BR and we need to scavenge for loot but Fortnite is so fast and the map is so small its not right most people drop right beside each other, and its not fair when one guy get shield and a purple pump and other buddy gets a grey ak and balloons.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Health/Shield on kill &lt; NEEDS TO STAY or something similar needs to be done. The map as I said before is too small. It forces players to each other very quickly especially with the vehicles in the game. With this being the case you are constantly getting 3rd partied, you cant possibly deal with the guy behind you after you kill the guy your on because you have no more HP now again you are on a \[unfair\] fight, which is what it comes down to. When trying to make a game esports ready you really need to eliminate every possible chance of making something unfair. ONE THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT&gt; People are saying they get thirsted more when the update for shield and health came, but realistically. It stopped you from getting thirsted by 3 quarters of the lobby. because if a 3rd party or anyone that didnt kill you sees you down they dont wanna finish you cause they will give health to the enemy who is up. This means only the person or team who killed you would want to finish you, which is how it should be anyway. I personally got thirsted less when it came out.  Maybe thats just my playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

\^ With that being said,

Mini's 50 Shields and Slurps need to be treated with more rarity like in supply drops and only from chests not found on the ground. again its not fair when someone drops beside you and gets minis and you dont, but if he kills you and gets shield. he DESERVES it. that shield is his momentum of the match that he deserves.  


\-Bring back the OG BOLT / VAULT the SilenceSniper&lt; There was nothing wrong with this sniper. If there was a damage issue then just adjust it, dont remove it. its an iconic sniper from most games that people are wanting and comfortable with.  


\-Fix the edit scroll reset trick   
OR Make instant reset a functional addition to the input list. period.

its not right that half the community doesnt know about this and is being heavily effected by it.

Here's my reasoning:

- When customs came out for creators during the STL event, everyone was happy about it, but some streamers used them in an effort to earn more money. E.g: subscriber customs. If customs are out, I don't feel like the creator should be allowed to limit the player base to only those who are paying him/her.

- With the arena mode just out, players will be looking to get to champions division. As far as I can see, when there isn't a tournament on, the majority of big streamers are just doing customs. This means that anyone looking to play in the champions arena will struggle to find matches, leaving the champions division fairly dead. 
- In it's current state, I'm not sure the servers are even able to handle customs at the moment. 

That's just my feelings on customs but I'm open to others opinions.",FortniteCompetitive

They dont represent the casuals or the competitive side, they're the ones that are better than casual players but don't want to (or cant) play competitively.","I'm going to be saying some controversional shit here so get ready for a fun time. 

Daequan, Dark, Ninja, Lupo, Tim, and probably more I don't know of are apart of the smallest group of individuals who were impacted the most by removing siphon/harvesting in pubs. Because these individuals have such a strong fanbase and their opinions seem to be favored more than others people are believing that this patch was the worse one and that Fortnite is going to die because of it. 

All the players listed above (except tim, sorry dude) are better than me. I might be throwing a little bit of shade at them, but they've been in the light for too long and a little darkness wont hurt. These players do NOT constantly play competitive and I'd say most of the whole community don't think they're ""sweaty players"". They primarily find their success in pubs, especially playing squads together and just casually pubstomping, and there's nothing wrong with that. But now pubstomping is incredibly harder, and some of these players cant just casually stomp anymore. Because they cant casually stomp they dont want to ruin their images of being a good player so they just opt out to not play the game at all. 

 These pubstompers have no where to go, and why a certain few are super upset and have decided to play other games on stream (Uno). But just because the pubstompers are upset doesnt mean YOU have to be. You have your own opinions dont let the people you watch influence your mind.

Casuals can play normal modes while competitive people can play arena. ""Well what about me, I'm better than casuals but dont have time to crank 90s in creative servers all day?"" Guess what! You can casually play Arena mode. Eventually you'll be at your own skill level and you can just enjoy the game. Being competitive doesn't just mean learning every new mechanic, cranking 90s/1v1s in creative or playing kovaaks for 8 hours a day, you can casually play competitive fortnite. 

We all know the playerbase has gotten A LOT better than previous seasons and this isn't a good thing for pubstompers. Each season players are getting better and that's making pubstompers have to play less casually and more intense. Even PK said a while ago that when playing Solos he cant just chill and read the chat while playing, instead he has to focus on the fights. If a player like PK says he cant casually play, how do you think Timmy (casual player) feels? This is why Epic implemented the changes.

Siphon allowed the pubstompers to casually stomp even though the playerbase was constantly getting better. But now that's gone they either arent good enough to compete or they're but they dont want to make it look like they're sweaty. Ninja, Lupo, and Tim, are casual pubstompers. If they try to hard they'll be seen as being sweaty, if they dont try enough they'll be seen as less skillful. The changes forces these players in a tough position and while I do feel for them. No matter what the patch would've said at least one group would be upset. Best thing Epic could've done is piss off the group with the lowest amount of players, the casual pubstompers. 

But this isn't me praising the patch. It had its ups and downs. My suggestions for Epic:
- Seperate loot pools for Arena Mode

- Revert Harvesting Rate

- Add new items to pubs FIRST then later for arena mode

- Add FNF with siphon BUT the same loot pool as pubs.

- Please add back chill traps I fucking loved them

Anyways, here we are. My controversional and unspoken/unpopular opinion. If you actually read the whole thing then cheers hmu on epic for a fun time ign: 6ft4 255lbs 5in.

Then S5 comes along. There is rifts, which can get you 1/3 of the way across the map in just a few seconds. We also get ATKs, which is the first true vehicle added to the game. This thing was pretty fast. You could get from location to location in under 20 seconds.


Then we get quadcrashers, which are very fast and allow you to boost. Then players find ways to fly with them. You can get all the way across the map in a matter of 25 seconds.


Then rift to go gets added, meaning that you can take a rift with you anywhere.

Then we get S7, and there’s a fucking plane, which is even faster than the quadcrasher.


Now we have driftboards and ballers, while not as fast as the plane, still faster than anything before S5.

So my idea is to give people rewards for reaching certain milestones and challenges in arena. The rewards can be skins, weapon skins, sprays, dances and emotes etc.
Milestones can be things like:
-Eliminate x amount of people in arena. 
-Eliminate x amount of people in Champions division 
-Qualify for contenders division, prospects division, champions divisions. This could just be a spray that say the division you qualified for with the shield that you count points on. 

-Win X amount of arena games. Win x amount of games in contender/ champions.
They can even add quirky things like win a game with x eliminations. ",FortniteCompetitive

Anything mentioned here is obviously followed at your own risk. Eventho this is written as tho it is aimed at people who just now built their PC, you can just as well follow it if your system is already up and running.
Useful tool: [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/downloads/cpu-z/cpu-z_1.88-en.zip) (Can be used to find your mainboard model, as well as to see if your Ram is running in dual channel)

##So you just built this juicy gaming rig and are ready to install Windows, right? **Wrong**

Here lies the most common thing to mess up: Make sure your ram is installed in a dual channel configuration. Ideally you’re looking to have two sticks installed in slots associated to the same (and first) channel, they are usually color-coded. Additionally, make sure to enable “XMP” (Extreme Memory Profile) in the bios. Where this option is located exactly differs from mainboard to mainboard, on MSI mainboards it’s in the overclocking section.   
Bonus Ryzen processor edition: Make sure to buy fast ram. Ryzen profits from quick ram, around 3000Mhz is usually going to be your best option, beyond that you have diminishing returns.

Altho rarely useful in regards to performance, but more so to stability: While you’re at it you might as well update your bios. The process differs from mainboard to mainboard so check your manual if you need to figure out how it works for you.

##So now you’ve installed Windows and are good to go playing games, right? **Wrong**

Go to the website of your specific mainboard model and install the latest networking, chipset and audio drivers. Stuff like ""Intel Management Engine (IME)"", ""Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST)"" and probably others are useless and can be left uninstalled. Eventho your system might be running, it is likely that it is running using Microsofts stock drivers which do work but are obviously not ideal. Obviously, install your Graphics driver as well and any peripherals that you happen to use depending on which of them actually have first party drivers (Mouse, …) When all this is done, reboot.

##Can I play some games now please?

Almost. There’s people out there that will now suggest you to set your windows powerplan to Maximum Performance and your gpu’s as well. Altho this *can* possibly help with rare FPS dips, I usually advise against it. Doing so will prevent your CPU and GPU from clocking down while in idle and thus waste power. Your hardware is smart enough to not clock down when it’s not idle. **but**, there’s a couple of things that you should change in your powerplan.

1. Open your Powerplan settings (Press Windows+R, type powercfg.cpl, press enter)
2. Select balanced, edit that and go to its advanced settings.
3. The powersaving features you will want to disable: Hard disk, USB, PCI Express. If you happen to play on wifi (Which you should not) change the wireless stuff to high performance.

##Do you really think anyone will read this wall of text?

Up to you, but we’re not done yet, here go the controversial things that **can** help with performance but are mostly a nice-to-do thing.

#####Overclocking
This isn’t really some magic tip but kinda obvious, make it run faster and it will run faster, duh. Overclocking your GPU will probably not give you as much of a return as overclocking your CPU does as most games are CPU bound (Especially since everyone plays on mobile quality graphics).

#####GPU Fan curves
A thing that I’ve noticed with my particular graphics card (Palit Super Jetstream GTX 1070) is that, for some reason its stock fan curve will, as it heats up, favour clocking down as opposed to ramping up the fans to keep the boost clock (Eventho it easily can do so while staying quiet). I’ve fixed this by downloading MSI Afterburner and applying a more aggressive fancurve. Occasionally, afterburner will fail to auto-start, giving me a noticeable performance hit ingame. Even if you do not suffer from this issue, It could also help with the fact that the less aggressive fan curve would make the air within the pc hotter, thus increasing the temperature of other components like the CPU and VRM’s, possibly causing a performance hit for them when / if they decide to thermal throttle.

#####Windows 10
Most of you are probably on Windows 10 which is a bloated piece of shit os by default, but you can cut down on that. There’s [this script](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater) which aims to make this process a breeze. **Read through what it what it does**, don’t just blindly execute it. Disclaimer: I’ve not used this, better than doing that is outright not using Windows 10 at all as I do, still got a year of lifetime in my windows 7 ;)

#####Autoruns
Age old advice still holds up, the less there’s running in the background the less stuff can possibly interfere with what you’re doing. You can Download [Autoruns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) and disable any things from starting up which you don’t need to actually run all the time, these will obviously vary.

#####And now for the hottest controversial thing that’s currently going around, this post from a couple of days ago
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b5tat1/smoother_gameplay_on_multithreaded_cpus/   
Neither on CSGO nor on Fortnite have I gotten any noticable performance gain from following that (And it makes sense since hyperthreading does not really work as outlined there, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj9cuHuTNVU) for a video on the matter), no matter what I tested: 3 threads, 4 threads, all threads, low resolution, native res, zero difference. I can see how this could possibly work for Ryzen processor users due to how their architecture is designed but I just don’t see how it would do anything for Intel users.

If I happen to have forgotten something, lmk. Unlike some people who try to believe you that theres a magic trick out there only known by one person in the world that magically increases your fps by 100%, there is not, save your time.

And add this to arena:

- quadcrasher 100% spawn rate
- chests 100% spawnrate
- can only get green or higher rarity out of chests
- heavy shotgun in green and blue rarities to compensate for tac vault
- grenades to compensate for clinger vault

The regular scoped AR can also beam people from slightly shorter ranges but it is a more automatic gun and will also beam people with more accuracy and no bloom if scoped in.
The reason for this seems to based on the fact other guns are way better than it. For example, the heavy sniper can do a 150 damage body shot! That’s ridiculous considering that on top of that it can break walls in one shot no matter how built it is or what material it is. 
Point is, are the scoped AR’s dead guns? Or do they have a viable use, or chance to be used if buffed in a certain way.

https://i.redd.it/l6cjz6rw73p21.png

# Motivation

With the qualifiers coming up, and in light of recent concerns regarding the lack of a customs-phase to qualification (pros think there should be a round of customs to determine qualifiers), I wanted to know how fair the qualification process is. To answer this, I modeled and simulated the entire qualification process, including individual games of fortnite.  


# Results

The result is the above graph. The X-axis represents player ELO, and the Y-axis represents probability. The blue dots are the probability that a player with a particular ELO qualifies in the top 3000 for the Sunday final (assuming 30k people manage to get 300 points in arena). The orange dots are the probabilities that a player at a particular ELO qualifies for the world cup.  


# Takeaways

Looking at the individual data points, the minimum ELO to be a shoe-in for the Sunday's round is \~2100 ELO (top 350 player, top 1.1% 300+ point players), which is 4.5 standard deviations above the average 300+ point arena player.  


The minimum ELO to have even odds at getting into Sunday's rounds is \~1750 (top 2500 players, top 8.3% of 300+ point players), which is 2.75 standard deviations above the average 300+ point arena player.  


The probability that the top 10 most skilled players qualify is as follows:

|Rank|ELO|Probability to Qualify for World Cup|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2748|0.94|
|2|2660|0.78|
|3|2636|0.7|
|4|2623|0.64|
|5|2581|0.52|
|6|2578|0.41|
|7|2570|0.43|
|8|2565|0.32|
|9|2565|0.31|
|10|2520|0.21|

  
That doesn't look great to me. There's a solid 6% chance that the best doesn't qualify, and a even-more-solid 22% chance that the second best player doesn't qualify. Mind, this is for a single event, and there will be multiple weekends to qualify.  


# Methodology

The hardest part to all of this is modeling a single game of fortnite. In order to do that, we simplify the game to 99 lethal 1v1s. I understand that people are better or worse at avoiding fights, and better or worse at picking fights, and better or worse at different stages of the game. Rather than attempting to model all of that, we wrap that all up into ""how good you are at winning a fight"". That should encompass picking good fights, avoiding bad fights, positioning, having high ground, etc. Ultimately after a game, there's 99 deaths caused by other players (ignoring the storm and fall damage), and that's what we're modeling here. If you're really good at third partying, then you're technically good at killing other people.  


Then, to simulate a game, we choose 2 people from the pool of alive players randomly, make them fight, put the winner back in the pool, record the results, and repeat until there's one man standing. We determine the outcome of a fight based on a player's ELO.  


At the beginning, we create a population of 30000 players on an ELO curve from a normal distribution with mean 1200 and stddev 200. Then, for each of the 10 games, we sort all of the players by their current point counts, partition them into chunks of 100 players (top 100 plays against each other, next 100 plays with each other, and so on), play the game, record the points, re-sort, and repeat. The top 3000 from the first 10 games moves on to play 10 games again, with the same methodology.",FortniteCompetitive

Companies making less money than Epic have better performance in their game. Epic are lazy, why do I say that? They took months to fix the issue where you couldn’t see teammate eliminations.

It should not be possible to build faster than the speed of turbo-building which I feel either turbo-building should be increased or there should be an alternative for Controller players.

Not sure if a lot of people see this as a problem but any Controller player playing in the Contender League will definitely have countered this at some point and it shouldn't be fair to know you are even more at a disadvantage.

I’ve done about 100 damage to player A but my duo has also suffered a lot of damage and player B is coming to wall replace him. If I go to help my duo, player A will quickly rush and attack us from a different angle. Should I:
 a.) push player A and try to quickly end the fight and rush to help my teammate
 b.) continue to fight player A at a normal pace and hope my teammate can survive his situation
 c.) rush to my teammate and both engage player B together
 d.) rush to my teammate and turtle together.

In this sort of situation should we be in separate boxes or simply react faster to the zone and immediately rotate with the same path? Does the answer change if enemies have explosives or stinks?

Now the fun begins .. they added ARENA MODE similar to pop up cup ... we SEA were fucked because we had to play on japan server... 150 + ping.... but we get less ping in EU than in Japan.. now guess what all the SEA players are going to EU looby to play ARENA . now this may not seem much but there are few good players in SEA.. they will climb rank and they will qualify (i have) and ruin your game as well as theirs..

now just imagine a few SEA players get to play in LUXE cup where you have 10 matches or even worldcup qualifier they already have bad ping so what will they do

I think the qualifiers should get to a LAN event with 4 groups of 100 players each, top 25 of each group would qualify for finals?

The groups could be made by 4 different seeds of 25 players, based on the qualifiers performance (like this you won't have stacked groups)

A tournament this size could be hosting a group a day during the week. Doing finals in the weekend.

Also, top 25 of the final should have direct invite for the next World Cup. Like many other esports, doing well in majors will grant you a spot in the next major.

Ever since I’ve been almost solely working on my mechanical skill. Now that I’m starting to get comfortable with M&amp;KB, I’m looking to try stretched out. There’s a ton of tutorials out there that explain how to stretch res on PC, but I can’t find any decent information for laptops. Anyone out there on laptop that knows how to do it? I can adjust my res in Nvidia GeForce Experience but there are no ‘popular’ resolutions available there (none of them is x1080). Wanted to start out with 1600x1080 and go from there, but can’t find it in GeForce Experience.

I’m using an MSI laptop with an RTX 2060 and an i7-8750H. I also use an external monitor.

For those wondering why I’m on a laptop: I travel a lot for work so I need a decent laptop to work on. That’s why I get a good budget from work to buy a laptop, which I can also use for private stuff (such as gaming). 

Any help is appreciated.

https://twitter.com/tsm_zexrow/status/1111371810522578944?s=21

I think the whole basis of the point was about the fact that its open and not actually customs with 100 player lobbies and qualified players. 

I get his point and it makes sense. If you read in the comments he says himself its best to do open qualifiers and then customs. I get this because it literally will but players in the tournament environment like in previous events. You would play 4-6 games(yet i would assume 10 since thats been the recent norm) and accumalate as many points.

In my opinion its not how i think it should be done. Completely understand what he is saying and he would know better than me but hear me out. Personally i would see it a little unfair if your lobby was stacked full of pros and your chances of qualifying are thrown out the roof. But not only that, it also can throw a lot of pros chances of qualifying out the roof too because they could all be in the same lobby. I feel the format now as open qualifiers makes sense. Because it literally will highlight the top players within the time frame. 

I wont say customs are something to avoid but for the nature of it being a ‘World Cup’ its a good thing to make it this way and gives everyone a fair chance of qualifying. Those that perform exceptionally will be the ones to make it to the grand final. ",FortniteCompetitive

It’s goal was to nerf double shotgun, which it did successfully. No one uses double shotgun at all anymore. However, this change in turn also made swapping to the same shotgun stupidly clunky. Why don’t they just restrict you to one shotgun and just remove shotgun swap delay entirely? Simple, easy fix. They already set their stance on running multiple shotguns, so this change would still be in line with their philosophy and make shotguns smoother to use. This change hurts NO ONE, and I don’t think would be a very difficult a change to make. They already have single item holding with glider redeploy, and shotguns didn’t have swap delay in the past, these fixes would be great and simple improvements.

TL;DR: Remove shotgun delay, only allow to hold one shotgun.

I run a youth program for gamers - providing esports, camps, tournaments, birthdays etc for kids as young as 8 and as old as 18.  As an avid follower of competitive Fortnite, I thought it would be interesting to get the opinion of the kids I work with daily on their thoughts with 8.20, specifically with the reverted Pop Up Cup changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they get enough credit really.  Some of their passion for the game rivals that of the enthusiasts / competitors on here.  Some kids are just trying to have fun - completing challenges and unlocking battle pass tiers.  Either way, keep an open mind, and be mindful of the children when you talk about why patches are implemented.  It's not always the ""squeakers"" that drive what Epic decides.   Here's what they had to say:

“Casual” more accurately describes those who don’t know when/what the patches are, play the game whenever they’re bored, and don’t know any of the more popular figures, strats, or events.

Let me make a quick outline of what you should expect in each division for starters.

**Disclaimer:** Give the system time to work. We need at least a few days for people to settle into their divisions. With that said, I am speculating a bit here, but I expect in champions, **we will eventually see very good scrims.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Division 1-4 (0-175 points)**

This is going to be an unhealthy aggressor fest. If you are below 175 points and you're complaining about people pushing you for no reason, don't be stupid, that's how the points system is setup. There is 0 bus fare in open, and only a -1 bus fare in division 4. Expect 30 people to drop first POI, and everyone to push everyone. It's gonna play out like a pub. So if you're at 160 points and saying ""I WANNA SCRIMMM"" stop. Keep racking up those points, you're not there yet.

**Division 5 (175-225 points)**

This is where I'm currently at. The bus fare for solos is now -2. That means in solos, points inflation is no longer a thing (duos is another story...but I'm going to just discuss solos for now). What this means is that players that on average score as many points as the whole lobby will stagnate and never get past this division. This filters out exactly one type of player. Those average unhealthy aggressors who think they're gods, but in reality they're not that good. It **does not** filter out unhealthy aggressor gods. They will still be racking up points. Therefore, expect to still get pushed by psychos. However, players who are not unhealthy aggressor gods will back off a bit, and start scrimming. This means that in this region, you get your 15-20 man end-game scrims, which is what I'm experiencing. They are shit scrims, but at least it's not a pub.

**Division 6 (225-300 points)**

Now understand this is speculation, but I'm fairly confident about this. This is the division that should start to get interesting. **A lot of players** are going to find that they can no longer drop hot and push mid-game, and still increase their score. This means things are going to become more scrim-like. There will still be those psychos out there, but the successful ones will be few and far between. Essentially, this means you will still run into these players in this points range, but the higher you get in division 6, the less and less you will start to see them. I expect in this points range, scrims should start to become decent, maybe 20-25 player end-games.

**Division 7 (300+ points)**

I want people to understand something here. Getting into division 7 should not be your goal. **Clearing yourself high above 300 points should be your goal if you want to scrim.** Now we don't know Epic's matchmaking system, and exactly how it works, but we do know it expands over time. The further away you can get from division 6, the better. **Example** \- there are 2000 players region-wide that are above 400 points. Then you will often get matches with almost all players being players who have successfully grinded champions. It's going to be nearly impossible to unhealthily aggress in champions, and continue increasing your points. Therefore, you should have matches with tons of players who actually scrim as well. If you are around \~300 points, you will have a ton of players who are still in division 6, who can still w-key and not lose a ton of points.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tldr;** Do not expect scrims so early in Arena's introduction. If you want top tier scrims, you should grind well above the Champions threshold. Champions should filter out unhealthy aggressors naturally. This will take many days, perhaps more than a week (even for good players), but I have faith the system will work.

The armrests on my chair wouldn't lower to my standard. They were so high that I couldn't get them to go underneath the desk when my desk/chair are at an optimum height (Uplift v2 Desk; best desk on the market). I hated when the armrests would bump into the desk because I couldn't sit close enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I removed the armrests from my chair and tbh it feels great. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do your elbows sit on the armrests while gaming?!?!?  I use a combination of arm/wrist aiming and my arm mainly sits on my desk.

Please let me know what you guys do and please recommend some gaming chairs for me that have armrests that can be set really low!!!

What we know is that there is a -3 bus fare for solos and -4 for duos at the highest level. We also know that lobbies can now start with 80 people again for the sake of queue time relief. We also know that, most importantly, being in Champion league the week of a given World Cup qualifier is the **only** way to play the weekend events starting April 13.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, in an 80 man lobby, there are 240 points lost to bus fare, with about 200 points to be won (125 for placement, 75-79 for kills). This leads to a -40 net loss of points every game. Spread out, that's at least 13 people who are -3 per match, at least 5 teams in duo playlists. 

  
With placement being the only way to fully guarantee you earn your points back, 25 people in solos are staying put at a net 0 gain, with others in that top 25 gaining 1 or 2 points a game. This rough calculation leads to this TL;DR: **At least 15% of Champion is going to be fluctuating between Contender 3 and Champ.**

  
This doesn't seem to be a problem because that's how ranked works, right? Wrong. Because once you reach Champion, you are qualified for World Cup and **have no incentive to play games in Champ other than for practice**. In most ranked games we have natural ELO decay, a punishment for a week or so of inactivity. There's also leaderboards, and as some have mentioned, they don't appear to exist in Arena.

&amp;#x200B;

From everything I have seen, there is no punishment for simply making Champ and **never playing a game except for the weekend qualifiers.** You will never lose points to bus fare, and you will always be qualified for the WC qualifiers. The best players will still play and leaderboard climb, of course, but that 15% of Champ that is repeatedly losing points (which will still be a huge portion of the player base) has no incentive to play.

&amp;#x200B;

What this will lead to is a disingenuous Champion league where a bunch of players aren't even playing. The counterargument is ""oh well then how will they practice?"" The workaround is that they can easily make another account, grind Arena, and be perfectly content fluctuating between ranks.

&amp;#x200B;

As a snowball effect (I checked and Arena does not require 2FA to participate in), these players will care less about games (they've already reserved their spot in Champ so why bother super tryharding!) and will practice what they want. That could be endgame, but it could very well be w-keying, thus ruining the experience for others.

  
Not to mention, the above side effects could lead to the same person having two accounts in Champ, effectively gatekeeping someone else out of Champ and definitely griefing the games of those in Contender 3, desperately sweating to make Champ league. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think can be done about this? To me, this is a huge problem and oversight that we're going to see become an issue as more people make it to Champion over the next week or so.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** *Champ league has no incentive to play for the player pool that is at risk of dropping out, potentially leading to a dangerous snowball effect and a highly inactive Champion league for those that do want legit practice for endgame and WC.*",FortniteCompetitive

The past few days I'm so pissed, it makes my blood boil.

They are doing a WORLD cup and right before it they are only letting one region (pros) practice for it in customs. 

It's 3 consecutive days that I see Tfue streaming customs with pros. They literally have staff in other regions and only care for one apparently.

They are getting many great matches, getting experience and getting valuable meta information (as you should in practice).

What a joke it is to invite all regions and let only one practice. They can't even use the ""testing"" excuse like in the other 10 times they gave customs to NA.

That's it. We from other regions are fucked. We have to do scrims (ranked != scrim) with bot countdowns and pray to god we all get into the same match (spoiler: we don't). Oh wait: we don't have that either because they changed the public matches now and it's a totally different game to practice.

Please, if you're a NA PRO, I'm not criticizing you, I'm just begging for Epic's help.",FortniteCompetitive

While I don't support the patch completely I believe there is some reasoning behind it that has not been mentioned.

The removal of scrim discords from the competitive community
is in both epics and the community's best interest, because it allows us to have all the competitive players in one que. This reduces que times, and puts more focus on their new arena mode, making it the first accurate measurement of a players skill, since stats haven't been able to do so in a long time. 
Scrim discord no longer have an impact since nobody wants to wait in a chat room for a countdown, to play in a lobby that doesn't even come close to mimicking a competitive match with its casual friendly format. I don't really see any other reason besides trying to force players into arena let me know what you all think.

Again, not saying I support this but instead of yelling and tweeting ""REVERT THIS"", lets come up with a solution to keep all comp players in arena que without enraging the rest of the community.

My thoughts and possible solutions to the issue. REPOSTED,"I had to repost this bc it was taking down for asking for upvotes, so I’ll say it this way, if you agree please show that you agree!


This post is about the many recent concerns about competitive matchmaking on console with regards to pc players. Let me start off by saying I am not a competitive player, yes I want to be better and yes I enjoy playing the game but I really don’t free enjoy competitive because I’m simply not that good. The changes to casual modes hurt at first but I think there’s a chance that it is for the better and I do understand why it was done. I have no problem playing competitive to get back those benefits we once had in casual. But please for the love of everything holy let us console players only play with each other. I know there have been other posts but they haven’t gotten as much traction as I’m hoping this will. I will go into a bit more details in a bit but I just want to restate that please if you agree show it!Epic seem to respond to posts that garner lots of attention!!

DISCLAIMER: I’m aware that this got very long but I encourage you to read it all the way through I put a decent amount of work into it and I think I make some valid points. 


Reason 1 - Stretch Res:

Clearly there are many things that give PC players the advantage over console such as custom resolutions. Stretch res is almost universally considered to be a large advantage over anyone on native as seen by almost all major streamers now switching to stretch such as tfue and many other competitive players. This is impossible for console players to achieve so even at a 100% even skill level the PC player has the advantage in that respect which is completely unfair to the console player. Also these custom resolutions can result in a higher frame rate in the end game especially which is a disadvantage to a console player who is stuck at the same frames no matter what which are often too low already. 

Reason 2 - Custom Graphics: 

Similar to how they can control their res, PC players can obviously control their graphical settings such as shadows and motion blur. These are also widely accepted as an advantage that when done increase your skill. So to again have something that would increase PC players skill that a console player could not do is just not a fair competitively. 

Reason 3 - Aim:

Obviously PC players have better aim and a lot more stability due to the use of their whole arm when aiming. Obviously epic has tried to combat this with things such as aim assist but even with that it’s just not the same. 

There are im sure more little reasons that I’m even unaware of but I wanted to just do an overview of a few of the major reasons that it is unfair to pair these player groups. I now want to address some criticisms and concerns.

Criticisms and Concerns:

Concern - If this ranked mode was split then how would tournaments such as qualifications be impacted?

Possible solution - I think the best possible solution would be to have a ranked mode where pc and console are mixed and one that is purely for console. If you chose to play in just the console one you wouldn’t be able to qualify for tournaments you would just be playing it to enjoy playing other console players at your skill level. Then if you feel like that’s too easy or that you want to qualify for tournaments you join the other playlist which would be the same as the one we have currently. 

Possible solution - this one would be less ideal but if epic would be totally against this due to something such as server stress of having two separate playlists that are basically the same or something like that (I don’t claim to understand how it works but I see it as something that could be a concern). Then I would ask that console just have a console only playlist and that perhaps only the top few, a more selective few, would be able to qualify for the events and tournaments from this ranked mode. If players on controller wanted better odds they could do as many other competitive console players (gronky, nickmercs, etc) have done and go play controller on pc. But this would obviously be tough because not everyone can afford an expensive super PC. But I think that giving a few less spots for the console only comp playlist for qualifications would also work. 

Criticism - if you think console is at such a disadvantage then go play on PC.

Response - while that is great in theory, not everyone can afford a PC and some people prefer to play with their friends on console who may also not want to play PC.


I would love to hear feedback or constructive criticism from anyone who wants to discuss in the comments and again I can’t stress enough how important it is to show you agree if you do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. 


TL;DR: I think that give the numerous advantages PC players have that even players of same skill level on different devices are not equal. I think a decent solution would be for console to have two ranked playlists, one for only console players that doesn’t count for qualifications, and one that’s mixed that does count for qualifications. 
 

Edit from first post - removed part about learning new style, any player that switched to Pc would likely stay on controller. ",FortniteCompetitive

Yes, we are in the competitive sub, and we *did* finally get a (hopefully) permanently implemented ranked mode, which I'm sure most of us are incredibly grateful for. This ranked mode does have very obvious limitations, though. For one, you can't play ranked trios or squads, so if you want to play with more than one friend, you're limited to squads. Secondly, if you're in a separate division, you can't queue together anyway, so if you want to play with even just one single friend who isn't in the same division as you, you're gonna have to play pubs. Also, not everyone frequenting this sub are top tier players, many just come here for tips, tricks and updates on competitive Fortnite. To think that only the top 0.1% would know about or care to visit this sub is preposterous.  

Another important point is that not everyone wants to ""tryhard"" all day, every day. Sometimes you just wanna chill and have fun in pub games with friends and not care so much about the game. Some of the most fun I've had in this game has been in solo/duo squads challenging myself (which is now much, much harder), but I get that Epic can't center their changes around solo squadders. 

Now, I do see where Epic is coming from with these changes, but I think they went about it the wrong way. The siphon does promote aggressive play, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially as the current meta is turtling. Remember the time when everyone towered up in tall 1x1s in pubs? Siphon defeats that kind of playstyle and also drastically reduces the penalty of taking a fight and getting third partied. With siphon, I would almost think that I was at a disadvantage third partying someone who just finished fighting, as they're likely high on both HP and mats. Now, I know for a fact that as soon as someone's done fighting, I can easily third party them as they're probably all low. I third partied an early fight in retail yesterday where I picked off 6 people by just spraying with AR from mid-range while they were fighting. Those kills were not a result of amazing positioning or game sense, they were a result of poor game design where taking early fights/getting pushed is heavily penalized and third partying is heavily rewarded. 

The ranked mode is something this game needed and has been in need of for over a year's time now, but its implementation is overshadowed by the huge amount of gamebreaking bugs that currently exist within the game. There are so many that I could make a full-on list, but I won't have to, because all of you are painfully aware of them all. I think most of us get that some of these bugs are hard to replicate and thus fix, but even just having Epic acknowledge these bugs and let us know that they're working on it would give people some peace of mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Not everyone in this sub are top tier players, and not everyone wants to play competitively all the time. If you have friends, odds are you can't play with them anyway due to there being no ranked squads, and you can't play with people in other divisions.** ",FortniteCompetitive

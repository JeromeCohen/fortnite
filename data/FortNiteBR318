It wasn’t until about the middle of Season 3 that I learned about Builder Pro controller layout, which drastically improved my game. However, I cannot get a hang of aiming in this game. It is so much different than every other shooter I’ve ever played (which is most of them), but I think I have figured out what the problem is. I think it is a combination of:

1) Aim-Assist kicking in before the reticle is actually over the target AND
2) Look Sensitivity being slowed down WAY too much when Aim-Assist kicks in

There is a particular scenario that has happened to me several times while playing that I think highlights that there is something wrong with the Aim-Assist. When someone that I plan to shoot is running perpendicular to my field of view and my reticle starts behind them, it takes a lot of effort to get the reticle on them. It always plays out like this... I zoom in and move the reticle to the target, the aim assist kicks in when the reticle is not quite over them, I start shooting because I feel the Aim-Assist kick in (of course landing zero shots because the reticle is not yet over the target, but rather 1 virtual foot behind them). Then because they are running away from the direction that my reticle is moving and because the Aim-Assist slows the Look Sensitivity down sooo much, it’s much harder than it should be to move the reticle actually onto the target. Then the element of surprise is gone, and it’s a fair fight.

This scenario makes it apparent that there is something off with the Aim-Assist. If anyone else feels like Console Aim-Assist needs some work please comment with your thoughts on it. Anyone else please comment with some aiming tips for the rest of us. ",FortNiteBR

Nerfed Shotguns: A builder's favourite weapon. I don't disagree with this nerf so much, pump/tac shotguns were too powerful.
Buffed Miniguns: The one thing that stopped people using these against builders was how weak they are, so they made them stronger.
Jetpacks: Do I even need to explain this one? Even if it's limited time they're a joke.
Llamas: Getting a llama early game helped good builders(and good builders only). So why nerf them, they were never massively overpowered, were they?

Why does a shotgun that shoots 3x slower than every other shotgun, has a delay, and bodyshots for 10 more dmg than a white tac that can headshot for 130+? The tac and heavy tac is now the only viable option for shotguns. If you push someone who has a pump and you have a tac, you now automatically win for free since you can never get one shotted with full shield and you can just put 8 shots into him before he can even shoot twice.

Building takes a lot of skill and practice to be good at there is no reason to make it harder than it already is by always having less mats. Back in season 1 you got like 60 wood from the small pines, what was wrong with that? Imo they needed to buff the mats not nerf them. Build fights are the only reason I still play this game and if they keep making them worse idk how long I’ll stick around.

Who was complaining about the pump being overpowered? Being one pumped is annoying but most of the time it’s good aim and not dumb luck. In my opinion, headshotting people for 22 damage from 2 meters away and dying because of it is way more annoying than being one pumped. Epic said they felt shotguns were overpowered for close combat. Of course they’re gonna be good at close range, they’re useless at every other range! They already nerfed the pump takeout time and made the stronger pump rarer, I don’t understand the further nerf.

Traps were too weak at 75 but wayyy too strong at 150. I think 100 would be perfect but anyways who in the first place was complaining about traps being op at 125? Realistically it’s your own fault if you walk into one lol. 

Some people argue that now the pump is worse than its rarer counterpart the heavy shotgun and this is how it should be. I think that they were already balanced because the heavy gave you less damage but more range. Seems fair to me.

Epic need to stop shortening the skill gap with every update. They shouldn’t cater to the shit kids because they buy every skin, dance and pickaxe that comes into the store. Really hope epic rolls back these retarded changes.",FortNiteBR

We’ve had lots of laughs playing it as a family and even managed a lucky  and much celebrated win last season!

It’s been a great learning process for them about how you behave online. Seeing different behaviours on 50vs50 vs those in solo or squads have sparked some really interesting conversations between us all so it’s all helping them learn their way in gaming and understand the dynamics of this particular game in its different modes. 

However their chat and messaging has always been disabled as we (my husband and I) will not allow them to talk/msg with people they don’t know in real life and that goes for all online gaming not just Fortnite. Am sure the majority of people are lovely but they’re our kids and we’re trying our best to keep them safe online as much as we try to keep them safe in real life.  

That all said, many of their school friends play as squads in a party and the boys are telling me that if they were in a party they can only hear and speak to their actual accepted friends. I’m prepared to spend the time verifying that friend requests genuinely tie up to people they know so I’m not worried about that but more about how it works in play. 

I spent yesterday afternoon trying and failing to get my head around parties on the PS4 and would love an idiot mum’s guide to setting this up and what the pitfalls, if any, are.   Is there a way of locking the PS4 and Fortnite settings down so that they can only hear and speak to their accepted friends in a party? Can friends of friends join a party and if so could my sons hear or speak with them?  I also can’t see how once these settings are unlocked how they could play 20vs20 or other similar modes without chatting to those non-party friends in their sub squad (if that’s even a term) or would it just be a case of telling them to select no fill if their friends are unavailable at that time or can you toggle settings for parties vs purely Fortnite squad play. 

Sorry for the lengthy post - I really am genuinely confused and would love some help and advice from this community.  Also I really hope it’s obvious that I’m not criticising those who do have purely online relationships and enjoy playing  Fornite together but it’s just not something I think my kids are mature enough to handle just yet.

So I came up with this cool idea for a squad based LTM. If you guys like this idea, please leave an upvote as we all know Epic listens to the community and we can get it implemented! Also bear in mind this is just a concept that I put together, so leave any feedback/suggestions in the comments and I will add them to the post.


**Here's the idea in a nutshell**

So there is 20~ squads as usual on the map we all know and love. Except in this mode, instead of 1 circle there will be roughly 10 circles and NO battle bus. In each of these circles there will be only be 2 squads, each spawned on opposite sides. These 2 squads must fight to the death 4v4 in each individual circle. Once the opposing squad has been defeated, you will move on to the next circle to duke it out to the death against the next squad. This cycle will continue until there is only one final circle left and only 2 squads remaining to battle for that sweet victory royale. 

**How this will work^(I've thought about this too much)**

*AGAIN, this is just a concept. I need the communities help and feedback to make this great :D*

This game mode will be focused solely around combat and building, and no farming, looting, or exploring will be done.
At the beginning of round 1 every player in the game will start with full health + full shield + 200 wood + a gray pistol. After the opposing squad is defeated in round 1, loot, ammo, and materials will be spawned for your squad to share. Each round should be fairly quick, the circle will slowly but continuously shrink as the round progresses. These circles will behave a little different in this game mode and destroy any structures outside of the boundaries, to avoid people camping in sky bases. This storm should also be a near insta-kill for the sake of keeping each round moving quick. After your squad has won your first battle and looted up, a teleporter will spawn that will take you to your next battle. At the start of this next battle any eliminated teammates will respawn and all health and shield will restore to 100%. No heals should be in this mode. Yes you heard that right, no more getting cucked to RNG of finding shields &amp; heals... in this mode atleast lul.

At the end of each round, the loot drops should progressively get better leading up to the final round. 
Ie.
Round 1: Green weapons + 800 mats
Round 2: Blue weapons + 1000 mats
.....
Final Round: Gold weapons + 2000 mats


*Side Notes*

No Explosives should be in this mode^imo

Naturally in this tournament style mode there will be ""bye"" rounds as the game progresses. If a squad is hit with a bye round, instead of just sitting around they should be able to spectate the opponent squad matches.


**That is all**

I can understand them removing the rockets but there’s no reason to decrease the materials in them, and the materials you get from floor loot and chests. If anything I think we need more materials in standard game modes to help make the game quicker but it seems like they want it to be slower. More proof that they seem to want this is the shotgun nerf. I’m not completely against this nerf honestly, but I don’t think it was necessary to change it so suddenly without saying anything. As annoying as it is to get one pumped, it rewards accuracy as can save you in a vital situation. Epic have been so good with the community, evident with the trap buff, and we need to speak up about these changes if we don’t like them. The weekly updates are great in theory, but they bring lots of bugs and sometimes contain unnecessary changes. The amount of updates need to be changed, if too much is changed it will destroy the game like what happened to H1Z1.

For example, I would love to get the Party Animal pickaxe in the store today but because I have already bought a couple of items this season, I am saving my v buck for Ventura, Airfoil and the glider instead, but I would consider buying both if it didn’t all cost so much.

The new fortnite update is good for the game (shotgun and building nerf). Here's why:

I'm sure everyone agrees that there is an inherent problem with gun balance in a game, if roughly 70&amp;#37; or even more of total kills are made with one weapon type (shotguns). The meta is all about getting up close, building, and shotgun fights. That is fine in itself, but the reasons for this meta are questionable: 1. mid range and long range combat often ends in two or more players being stuck at distance without being able to kill each other due to building. The only solution to proceed is to close the gab, and engage in a building shotgun fight. So little viability is not good for a game. 2. The game doesn't punish bad positioning enough, due to instant building. One can stupidly run in an open field, asking to be killed, but in fortnite, that is not a concern. Positioning is mostly only a concern in close quarter and building fights. Once again, the meta is forced to this. 3. The meta is all about shotguns shotguns shotguns, but the weapon hitreg is broken, which they said they aim to fix soon.

The update should shift the meta (1) slightly away from only one gun type to dominate, and give room to mid range combat, and (2)countering building (minigun buff and fewer mats etc.). is now a more effective strategy, meaning clever positioning is more rewarded. Overall, both tracking aim, and other valuable skill fields such as positining, are more rewarded now, rising the skill gab, rather than lowering it, even if the gab between excellent builders and deceng ones is lowered (learning building took us enthusiasts about 3 months, good aim with other strategical qualities of shooters take a lifetime).

All this does not mean the game doesn't have shotguns and building anymore. It's just more balanced with other viable options and strategies now. This is an excellent and really thought through balance update for the game. For the first time the devs are not just simply seeing where the game is going, they are balancing it, which is what the balance team is for.

If you disagree, please explain why. Double pumping was fun (which is still insanely strong, and I do too), is not a good reason to argue against this balance update.

1. Weapon delay:  
Disable weapon switching until the next shot can be fired (or the gun has to be reloaded). This will also mean it kills double pumping. So unless you find another reason to carry 2 shotguns, you will not be at an advantage.  
At the same time it does barely impact any other gun in the game (maybe the burst), but makes switching to a secodary after sniping faster.  
Also deciding to use a slow firing but hard hitting close range weapon is now more impactful, since you commit to the switching cooldown when pulling the trigger, wich hopefully makes the SMGs viable close range options.
2. Pellet patterns:  
Since I am unfamiliar with Quake, I will reference TF2, wich uses the same system in competetive mode:  
""Fixed weapon spread is enabled.  
This means that pellet-style weapons (Shotgun, [...]) fire pellets in a nonrandom pattern. The pattern is composed of 9 hitscan paths spaced like a 3x3 grid, with one extra pellet going down the center [...]"" ^[\[1\]](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Standard_competitive_format#Weapon_Spread)  
As seen in [the example image](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Standard_competitive_format#/media/File:Fixed_weapon_spread.png) (To provide scale for the distance: normal movement speed (for example the pyro) is 300u/s).  
I think there is not much to say about this suggestion, since in my opinion more consistency is always better.

What are your thoughts about this? Do you think schotguns will be in a good place after the nerf? Do you think Epic should continue fiddleing with the weapon mechanics or have you had enough?",FortNiteBR

Before I start my rant, I played H1Z1 and PUBG for a heavy amount of hours before Fortnite came out. And I've played the BR mode for Fortnite since day one of it's release. The only reason I mention this is to give some sort of credibility to what I'm saying. I'm by no means a pro player but I'm definitely a veteran to the genre.

In my own opinion the building in Fortnite has gotten out of control and it ruins the game. When it first started no one knew how abuse it. It was simple, build a wall if you get shot, put up a ramp to get on a house, etc. It was a nice change from other BRs and aloud room for some out plays. Then people started building 1x1 structures mid combat, building high towers to establish high ground, building ramps aggressively to get a fighting advantage. To me this was great and the last this game was actually fun. But now... everyone and their grandmother watch streamers like ninja, and myth, and OPsct, etc. And what do they do? build these wooden monstrosities into the sky until you can get a shotgun advantage on your opponent. So of corse this is what everybody does now and it's a boring Pvp experience . This game has turned into ""who can out build each other"" rather than being a better shot. 

""deer hey buddy, then why don't you go play H1Z1 or PUBG?"". Because those games on a technical level are broken. Countless glitches, bullet registry being unreliable, needing multiple keystrokes to interact with guns, doors, and cars.  When the Fortnite BR came out it was a fucking gift because finally a AAA studio made a game in this genre THAT WORKED. It's smooth and fast paced and the devs care about the product they are giving us. Which is even sadder why I find it hard to enjoy this game just for the building aspect, because that wasn't always the case. 

Obviously I don't expect this to change. I'm sure Epic sees the building mechanics as part of the reason why it's blown up in popularity. But It'd be nice if there was a rotating game mode that removed building. Or in a perfect world if they just nerfed it down to being able to build 2 or 3 blocks high off the ground. It really feels like it's gotten out of hand even more than they ever planned to happen with the building. 

Again, this is just a rant of my opinions and I'm overall curious if anyone els feels the same.",FortNiteBR

TL;DR \- Make shotguns consistent, then nerf them over time. Being able to one shot at very close range with a perfect shot = good. Pump nerf makes it much harder to win when outnumbered. However, double shotty should't exist.

The main reason I don't like the changes to the shotguns is simple: it feels bad to play with them. Was the pump overpowered? Probably. Should it have been double nerfed in the same update? Probably not. 

A big problem I have with this update is that they decided to nerf both base and headshot damage of the pump *before making shotguns consistent*. How many times have you lined up a shot and you don't get the full damage because of random pellet spread? This is the first thing that should've been done before even touching the numbers, since the power of the shotguns will change yet again once they implement this. Changing headshot damage of a blue pump from 237\-\&gt;170 feels very jarring and unrewarding. By far the worst shotgun right now imo.

Also, after the update, none of the shotguns can one shot. I know people complain all the time about getting one pumped, I believe that this is a healthy part of the game. You should be rewarded for hitting a perfect headshot on someone very close range. However, I do think the old pump was a little too powerful in that regard, and I would've liked for them to reduce the range a tad and make a perfect headshot be just a bit over 200. This would reduce the amount of ""random""/""lucky"" one pumps that you receive, while still making you feel rewarded for a well placed shot.

Another major problem with the pump was the ability to use a second shotgun to completely disregard the drawback of the pump (fire rate). Regardless of whether the current nerfs stay or not, Epic should make the weapon swap time MUCH longer (think 1.5x or 2x) when switching from shotgun to shotgun. Running two shotguns should not be as prevalent as it is.

This whole update seems very knee jerk to me, much like the trap nerf. Instead of nerfing over time, they overnerf in one update and then fix it later. Slowly nerfing or buffing is the way to go in online games, as it allows much finer tuning of balance. 

In conclusion, I think they should nerf double shotty, buff the pump to do slightly about 200 dmg for a perfect headshot, make shotgun spread consistent, and reduce the range of the pump. Discuss with me in the comments, I'd love to see the community's thoughts on my proposed changes/the current nerfs.",FortNiteBR

The only time I felt the nerf is when I use the tac and man I wasn't happy. With how inconsistent I felt the tac already was with this nerf I think I'm just not going to touch tacs anymore. Also the fact that pumps can't straight up one shot people is just bad. The only reason I use pumps is for that one shot power but now that's gone (the pump nerf haven't affected me today but I know I gonna get into that one fight where I really need to one shot my enemy and he'll just survive the head shot and kill me. 

So basically I feel tacs are just dead and pumps can lead to your death if the guy has full hp and shield and you aren't double pumping (like most people). Honestly this has been some of the most disappointing patch I ever seen in my time playing Fornite. Also since pumps can't one shot anymore anyone got tips on how to double pump :)",FortNiteBR

It was fun as hell and had only minor issues. As more and more people started to play, Epic began to add new features to the game. This was understandable because they want to make the game more enjoyable. However, this has not stopped and they have not focused on the many issues that are making the game less and less fun. I can't even remember when the issues with shotguns being inconsistent began. We have voiced this over and over yet it hasn't really been addressed. They just keep adding more things that have their own issues that come with them. With this most recent update, shotguns have become even more unbearable. And it isn't just that. Building has so many issues such as players walking right through builds, not being able to place builds, or not being able to build if you build too much. As a game that is based on this building mechanic, I would think they would want to fix all of their issues as soon as possible. The lag has been an issue since the game began and players are frequently hit with random spikes of connection issues. I'm not suggesting remove adding things all together, I just feel that this thread is filled with suggestions for them to add weapons or items or whatever when they seem to be ignoring these crucial aspects of the gameplay.  I find the people I play with and myself have been becoming more frustrated when we play. When it comes down to it, I want a game that functions properly and doesn't make me think there is randomness to if I'll die every second.",FortNiteBR

I do not want this game to become H1Z1 where they drive it into the ground with all of the changes.  There is a reason this game is fun, because of the content and in my opinion, the skill gap.  I took pride in being able to one pump someone because I build higher and out play them.  The 9's weren't even a big deal, I wouldn't get them very often.  I really wish EPIC would just let the meta stay, and not mess with it every single week.  It's getting repetitive and stale because the skill gap gets smaller.  

This probably won't gain ground on this sub, but please if you see it, lmk what you think.  ",FortNiteBR

For example a bug the has been occurring for a long while now is when the game loads me into a match when the bus already reached the end and I am forced to get off. Another bug that has been happening that is critical to me playing the game in a stable condition is the fact that sometimes my teammates and/or opponents and/or buildings placed by other players go invisible. Another critical bug is sometimes the option of me picking things up with my E key is not possible since the option doesn't appear I can't pick things up. As well as when I get into a match at times my pickaxe doesn't load in so I can't break or farm anything. Not only that but since the addition of the new shopping cart whenever I hop on (passenger or driver) my screen turns blue with the only thing visible is the hud and the chest noise plays at max volume, this also happens sometimes when I'm killed and I'm spectating another player. My mac specs are below. Please someone help me fix these problems.

The past week has me thinking otherwise. First off in the week, they nerfed llamas and material stacks. Why would you do this? If the battle is building, as it states in the trailer, why are you trying to get people to run out of resources. I’ve been playing this game from the beginning and I know how it was before everything. You can’t tell me anyone asked for this. That there was overwhelming support for a nerf in materials. If there was, it was obviously from the beginners who just started playing. So okay, who cares, just farm more. Then today they decide the pump and tac were op. They claim it’s “weapon balancing” but last time I checked everyone has the same guns so in turn it is balanced. With someone on 100 health, 100 shield, the pump still takes 3 hits to kill someome (all body shots). So okay it stays the same no harm, right? No. The tac has become a nerf gun with their “improvements”. So the new nerf decrease headshots of shotguns to only a 2.0 headshot max. So at point blank range, a rare tac shotgun that does 74 damage on a shot, can’t even kill someone with 150 health (with it doing 148 damage). So yeah, everyone knows the tac sucks right? Well what about the pump? Well an uncommon pump can only do 160 as it’s max headshot, at point blank range!! And the rare one can only do 170!! So tell me epic. Who asked for this? Headshots are one of the best things in the game, they keep you in the fight and help you from taking loads of damage. Stop nerfing guns that nobody wants to be nerfed. I don’t see you in the patch notes fixing the jump through wall glitch... or even the 9 damage pump glitch. Everyone who agrees with me please show some support. The developers need to know the people are unhappy. If want the old pump, tac, and llamas back, speak up. Cause quite frankly, I don’t want to play a game that is no longer enjoyable when you are sure to die when getting pinching by running out of mats, or getting a point blank headshot and not killing someone.

I tested out a smurf account, and within my first game I had racked up 8 kills and a fairly easy win. Their were many bad players and bots, and it was honestly a cakewalk. I played paragon, and SBMM is what drove me away from it. I fear that with recent changes, they are catering to new players.

What did they do? They listened.


The game was going all good imo until season 4? Dusty was the most fun I had but thay was for 2 weeks only and after that, the game is stale.

I loved weekly updates, but even that is kinda gone now, wtf is a boost pas?

Yeah let’s take something out and add it in a content update later on.

This game is going horrificly now, Idc either way because I play save the world, and the only reason I’m on fortnite right now is because no other game interest me, I’m a cod player and left ww2 for fortnite, but bo4 will definitely take me back, but this game is getting praised so much it’s stupid.

None of my friends even play it anymore, I have friends that left fortnite to play brawhlhalla, assasin’s creed origins, and even warframe.

Why the fuck did they even change the llama’s are they sick in their heads?

Yeah we only
Have 3 freaking llama’s in the WHOLE MAP so finding it should be rewardi... oh no! 500 materials is too much jonesy, lower it
Down immediately! *or else it will be op!*

If thy’re going to keep on going like this heck supply drops will include common pistols.


Idk if anyone of you knows but all epic want is less building, I got a simple fix for that, a SIMPLE fix, I name it...
Wait let me first introduce the style we put it in, LTM ‘the thing where they test stuff’ why not add a gamemode where you disable building?

“Limited time” things.

Dusty Divot, the Jetpack, and Hoprocks and all long overstayed their welcome for starters. I don’t know why Dusty can’t be updated weekly. 

Materials/Traps

The Llama nerf was pointless, they’re rare for a reason. Reducing the chance of material stacks to spawn was pointless aswell. If they’re going to make them spawn only 1/3 of the time they used to, they could at least boost how much material you get from it. I also don’t see how Epic could nerf traps into uselessness, see everyone begging for a balanced damage output of 100, and then decide DOUBLING the trap damage to 150 is the “balanced” decision. How can you go from thinking 75 is balanced and 125 is too much to thinking 150 is a good middle ground?

SHOTGUNS.

Jesus christ, I get shotguns are a big part of gameplay (as you’d expect from a game that revolves around close courters building battles) but what was the reasoning in nerfing the headshot multiplier AND base damage? Epic has nerfed the headshot multiplier on the shotguns before and it was received poorly so they reverted it, why would it be any different now? What makes this change 100x worse is their reasoning behind it. Epic claims that making the shotguns come out slower somehow increased the shotgun usage. How does that make any sense? At all? If you’re going to nerf shotguns at least fix the inconsistency issues first. Last thing, when will epic realize that nerfing the shotguns damage only makes double pumping more necessary? Nothing they do to the shotguns will make them any less used unless they nerf them into the ground. It’s just how the game plays. If they want to fix double pumping they can go for that, not the shotguns in general.

i made some calculations about the shotgun meta right now, the blue tac does 74 dmg /148 in the head (Fires alot faster then a pump, even double pump) where a blue pump does 85dmg  /170 in the head and goes significant slower then single tac. 
So my thought was that it isnt even worth to do double pump now but rather a single blue tac is better dmg wise. Single Blue tac is shooting 1,5x where as double pump is shooting rougly 0,9x a second so the DPS of the weapons is noticeable and more convenient with 1 shotgun.

Blue tac DPS    = 111 (not taking headshot dmg in)
Blue pump dps = 76,5(not taking headshot dmg in)

Blue tac headshot DPS     = 222 
Blue pump headshot DPS = 153

With these past few updates, Fortnite is beginning to remind me of Destiny.  I logged countless hours into Destiny, and it was my favorite game of all time.  I used to play it for hours every day.  Then, they nerfed secondary weapon ammo, completely ruining the game.  I didn't play once again after that update, and neither did half the community.  I see Fortnite going down this road with the material, shotgun, and trap nerfs (and buffs).  I am extremely frustrated by this, and I don't want to see Fortnite fail for years to come.  Fortnite is all about building, and it is (arguably) the main mechanic in the game. Why nerf materials?  The community is what brought Epic Games its massive success, and this is the opposite of what *we* want.  Why nerf shotguns?  There are already massive complaints about shotgun consistency problems.  Why make them do *less* damage?  Why nerf traps to an (in my opinion) healthy 75 damage, and then *increase* the damage to 150? This is the exact opposite of what the community wanted. I think this quote from the recent update notes sums this up perfectly. ""For awhile we felt that Shotguns promoted healthy close quarter gameplay, however with the recent equip time changes, **Shotguns are being used more often than we like**.""  This is the issue I see for developers with successful games.  They take it upon themselves to change the game to what they think is better, ignoring what the community wants.  Don't get me wrong, I love the constant updates to Fortnite.  I just feel like for this game to stay successful for years to come, the developers need to truly listen to the community that made their game so successful.

-Shoots faster
-Same damage potential
-Further range
-Faster switch speed

Now that the pump does 2x headshot, with the heavy still doing 2.5x. So the heavy can do about 180 damage vs the blue pumps 190. In any battling situation, they're both nearly killing the opponent but not quite if they have full shield, so there damage is effectively the same. Since the heavy is superior in all other aspects it is now a better option in any situation.

I dealt with the no-building glitch. I dealt with the gun teleporting out of your hands glitch. I even dealt with kids glitched under the map in several locations and killing me. 

But glitches aren’t what is making the game as bad as it is now.

The constant need that Epic feels to add toxic items and buff them repeatedly is what is ruining this game. So I’m gonna make a list.

- Clingers.

You can throw them extremely fast, extremely far, and they do a decent amount of damage. I’ve seen them blow people up through walls several times, and I’ve completely missed somebody yet it somehow stuck to them. Clingers were a mistake. 

- C4
C4 was fine. They did good damage to structures but not too much against players. But then they increased the blast radius. You could then blow up an entire house with a few clicks. But then they buffed them AGAIN. You can now destroy the entire Tilted castle with only a few of them. You can damage someone several meters away from them, and they can blow up in mid air now.

- Minigun
This gun was already toxic and it caused everyone to roll their eyes once an enemy started using it. But then they buffed it... again... and again... and again... and AGAIN. Now it’s ridiculously powerful. If an enemy team combos this with a nade launcher don’t even bother building. Just leave the game lol

- LMG
This thing isn’t too bad... unless the game just started. If you get one of these you get 100 free bullets immediately while everyone else is struggling on ammo and has little to no mats. Have fun shredding through an entire team that has no mats to build without even having to reload. They should only start out with maybe 50 bullets and you have to load the rest in yourself later. 

- Materials

Epic has yet again nerfed materials. You used to be able to get so many mats very quickly back in season 1... and that’s when nobody knew how to build. But now tons of people can build and Epic thinks it’s a good idea to make mats drop less... where is the logic? Oh, right. They have to cater to the younger fan base and try and reduce the skill gap. Otherwise who will be left to steal mom’s credit card for skins?

- Crack Rocks and the Divot

They were fun at first... but it’s ridiculous now. You can snort some crack and still have it by the time you get to Salty for some easy cleanups. 

The Divot is literally a giant stain on the map. I really hope that it gets filled in and Factories come back. Or maybe just make it smaller. 

- Traps

This one blows my mind the most. They nerfed the damage from 125 to 75, which may have been a bit much, but then they made them activate more quickly and it was perfectly balanced imo (as all things should be). 

But then out of nowhere they increase it to 150. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY. Did they forget that they made them activate more quickly?

- Shotguns

They nerfed the Tac and Pump shotgun. Their reasoning for this was that the pull out delay made people use shotguns more... how does that make any sense? Nerfing something makes people use it more? 
Anyway, this means that the heavy shotgun + tac SMG is the new meta. I can live with that. But you know what else this means? Someone can place a trap under you at Tilted, you pump them to the skull, but you still die first. Lmao

- Damage fall off vs. structures 

There is no longer damage fall off when shooting at structures. Yet again building has been nerfed. Are you having a crazy build off with someone? You better not be because a guy camping in a bush 250m away is shooting you down as we speak. 

- Jetpacks.

Not much needs to be said. I think we can all agree that they were the worst thing to ever happen to this game. But when you combine everything above with the Jetpacks... you get some broken monitors. I liked the fact that you could save yourself from a fall, but we have bounce pads for that now. They should’ve stayed in LTMs and never been added to the normal mode. Close Encounters was actually really fun, but sadly I barely got to play it since it got removed after complaints about skybasing. Really? You have the power to build and a jetpack, what’s the big deal? And I love how they can act that fast for an LTM but not for bigger problems in the base game. Epic finally announced that the Jetpack is being removed from the normal gamemodes, but we still have to deal with it for now. 

Oh, and I know I said glitches aren’t the big problem with the game right now but don’t worry, there’s still plenty of them! 

Do you agree or disagree with any of this? Let me know. Don’t just upvote or downvote blindly, let’s have a discussion. ",FortNiteBR

But now with materials and shotguns being nerfed, the game doesn't feel the same. It already feels a lot more defensive than before, and will probably get worse as people adapt to the changes. Rushing people has been nerfed now that shotguns aren't as good and you have to conserve your building materials (unless you go full lumberjack simulator for the first 10 minutes of the game). I had no problems with how the game was before, I almost never got 1 shotted by the pump, and all the building was fun. It just doesn't feel the same, rushing people is a much worse option than before, especially if you don't feel like gathering materials most of the time.

Just feels like Epic is trying to please the new players by sacrificing what made the game great in the first place.

Here are some of my opinions and I wanna hear your guys's thoughts as well. Let me know if I missed anything

Jetpack/HopRocks/BouncePad

-Jetpacks
I know Jetpack was LTM; but hopefully the Jetpack never comes back; it just disbands the whole building process of Fortnite and just makes an easy out for players that can't build which is just unfair to the players that can. 

-HopRocks
I feel like the Hoprocks are only in-game because of the meteor hitting Dusty and it's all apart of their story capture and an easy way to get out of the divot and I'm cool with that but I'm hoping these rocks aren't in-game for later in the Season or the future seasons because the hop rocks again create an unfair advantage to the builders again and in which they can just fly over their building. 

-BouncePad
I don't really have too much problem with this new item because it seems fair and balanced. But it really is another unnecessary item to add. Not too much to say on this but just an item that needs to given more time in-game to see the FULL cost of it.

New Shotgun/Trap/Material changes

-Shotguns
Honestly one of the worst nerfs I have seen because first; the double pump nerf was good enough to reduce the factor of quick burst but now Epic you are trying to switch people off the shotgun meta which is just ridiculous. Revert the shotgun changes. I think most of us can agree that this is one of the bad changes that they could've done. 

-Traps
125 was a perfect number; traps did not need to be touched. 75 was too low; 150 is just a huge spike. Yet again it's a pleb move to bump into a trap but 150 is just too high. In my eyes, 100 is a good balanced ratio if Epic wants to meet halfway.

-Material changes
WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU EVER NERF THIS IF ANYTHING BUFF THIS?! You are implementing so many items that counter building you need to balance it out by adding more material to the games man. 

OT: Epic you're going the opposite way right now with this recent changes, thank you to anyone who has viewed my opinions.

I know some people complained about getting one pumped, but in my experience i’ve only been one pumped a handful of times in about 1,500+ games. My thought was always that you put yourself in the vulnerable position to get shot in the head, and your opponent hit the perfect shot, so if thats the case then you deserved to die by the pump.

C4.
When the C4 was introduced to the game, it felt weak and unreliable but a patch changed all that by buffing it. But the 4.3 CU completely made the C4 actually OP to the point where it would literally obliterate a single house into dust.

Suggestion: Change the C4s back to the patch where it was only slightly buffed.

Shotguns. 
The double pump meta has changed the game in a bad way but Epic Games now encourage you to use DP because they made the shotguns much weaker. You can no longer get 1 shot kills by using the shotty. If I have my pump crosshair placed directly into your head then I should be able to kill you in one shot. The tactical was okay the way it used to be, don't nerf it as well.

Suggestion: Fixing the Double Pump meta will be a controversial one. I don't know how Epic will handle the problem but they handled it very poorly with this update.

Llamas and Floor Mats.
Finding llamas as a blessing. They are so rare that it should give you a lot of mats but unfortunately, they nerfed the llamas by only giving 200 mats each and less ammo. I'm neutral with the ammo being lessened but the mats is unforgivable. I thought Epic knew what made Blitz mode so great. I thought they would buff the material gain rather than lessen it. We want more build battles and less hitting of trees. Farming mats is one of the most annoying things that you can do in Fortnite.

Suggestion: Buff material count and change the Llamas so that they give 500 mats each rather than 200 or make Llamas more common.

Jetpacks
Remove it permanently. It ruins the flow of the game. Someone who has a jetpack being able to fly up to your face and you building against him is just- STOP. It's annoying to have to cover all sides just to protect yourself from a flying enemy coming from everywhere.

The Storm of 20v5

I feel like we need some transparency in how testing is done prior to these changes going live, if any testing is done at all.


**Shotguns**

A large part of the community agrees that shotguns are in a very powerful spot currently, Epic has adressed this previously, but have come up short with a satisfying solution so far.

Not too long ago they introduced pull out animations to punish swapping between weapons, this made the game feel very slow and took a while for Epic to get it to a somewhat acceptable state. This could have been avoided had the change been properly tested beforehand.

On the 6/6 patch they nerfed Pump shotguns headshot multiplier from 2.5 -&gt; 2.0 and reduced it's base damage from 90/95 to 80/85 because and I quote:

&gt;*""Shotguns are being used more often than we like""

This is while Double Pump is alive and well and the strong shotgun meta is largely due to the fact that you can swap between shotguns with little to no tradeoff. Was the Pump too strong? perhaps, that's not the point im trying to make here. What I am saying is that there are a lot alternatives that should be considered before nerfing the maximum damage of a weapon by ~40%.

**Traps**

Everyone remembers the trap nerf from 125 -&gt; 75 damage, a huge nerf and one that made traps feel unrewarding.

The community came to a general consensus that 100 damage would be a better fit, making traps viable and rewarding without being too strong.

With the 6/6 update Epic has now buffed traps from 75 -&gt; 150 damage. At this point you should just have left traps alone from the get go. 

It really feels like Epic is using the Live version to test ideas, instead of having a testing environment or perhaps making more incremental changes. One can't help but think they are doing this on purpose to keep things ""fresh"" and cater to a larger audience.

**Materials**

Materials were recently changed in the 6/5 patch, reducing floor stacks from 30 -&gt; 20 and reducing the materials from Lamas from 1500 =&gt; 600.

Yet back in March, [Epic stated that they were considering increasing material gathering overall](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/85v0qf/blitz_ltm_building_material_change/dw09wu4/), yet now they make this change with virtually no justification. 

The material levels definitely need to be monitored as you want farming materials to be a conscious decision and a tradeoff. Having materials 24/7 without much thought makes farming obsolete. In a competitive manner, being able to manage your materials is a very interesting aspect.

Therefore there should be some transparency in the goals of these changes when they are implemented, instead of us having to rely on individual comments from Epic.

The point I am trying to make is that drastic changes to core gameplay mechanics should be tested, documented, justified and explained more in detail.

They changed so many fundamentals of the game that made it fun, its depressing. lets start with the general materials change. First off, everyone was suggesting UPPING the amount of materials because they were unhappy with the amount of mining required, now, they made it HARDER to get materials, what?!?!  i dont think a single person asked to lower the material stacks from 30 to 20. Second off, WHY would you change the llamas? if there are only 3 in the entire game, I WANT GOOD LOOT. and why get rid of the rocket spawn if that's a huge part of the llama?!?! now i cant give less of a shit if i find a llama or not.

 Secondly, lets talk shotgun damage. i definitely agree with the pump being nerfed and the headshot multiplier being reduced, but why touch the tac, in fact, why not buff it? i think we can all agree the tac is a pretty shitty weapon that hits 6s's left right and centre. so please dont nerf a shitty weapon.

  Thirdly, ive seen people get annoyed over the 75 damage trap, and i agree with the buffing of it. but what in the actual fuck 150 damage?!?!? i thought 125 was a bit much for walking in totally silent trap, but now even if i take a big or 2 minis, i still die, what the fuck? this devalues minis and shield potions alot considering they can be negated by a fucking green trap. thats retarded, a trap does more than an RPG to the face. K.

  Lastly, the fucking C4 radius got even BIGGER?! like damn 2 c4's can take out a house now its one c4. not too bad of a change but still very questionable.
PS. dont forget how retarded removing rockets from llamas are.

TL;DR: Epic shit the bed with this update and ruined many things that we found fun with this game. things like increasing a fucking traps damage from 75 to 150 (this pisses me off the most) or changing material stack to 20 for some reason. all these changes are going to ruin or change many of the fundamentals of the game",FortNiteBR

The shotgun change on the other hand was unnecessary because now the Tactical Shotgun does even less headshot damage and the Pump Shotgun can no longer one shot (170 is highest you can do). This makes the Pump Shotgun useless now as if the Tactical can two shot and the Pump can’t one shot then doesn’t that make the Tactical better because of its fire rate and completely obsolete the Pump?

TL;DR The trap change is okay but the shotgun change wasn’t needed.

As Epic has stated in the post, their main goal is to try to make it to where you can win in multiple different ways.

It's simple trial and error with Epic. They implement a change, analyze the data/community opinion, and adjust accordingly. I believe here that they are trying to make traps a more impactful part of the game. Nick Eh 30 for example has been doing some insane things with all of the new items in the game. Having traps do 150 could open the door for all kinds of cool clips/kills. 

With them doing 150, it is less likely that players will throw them up in random spots and run away. It's more likely for them to be held onto and implemented into build battles/CQB's. This could be really interesting to see and try to adjust to. 

All I'm saying is to give it a little time to see how this change actually affects the game, rather than hate it before seeing..",FortNiteBR

I use a default PS4 controller, and hold it like most players do, meaning I can't jump and shoot at the same time ( which I feel to be the biggest drawback). So I would guess KB+M would have a huge advantage overall as they could jump and shoot, have keybinds for all the build pieces/weapons, and people also say it's easier to aim with a mouse than joysticks.

The closest I can think of matching them with a controller is using a Scuf, but I keep hearing people saying they don't last for more than a few months. 

Like I don't see why anyone wouldn't use KB+M, especially if it's a tournament and not against the rules.

Do you guys think they are really common , at least in the top percentage of console players?

Why tf use a pump then? The refresh time is too long, have fun getting melted by literally any other gun in the amount of time it takes you to get 2 shots off, even with a clean swap. Pump swapping takes skill. Period. 

Fewer mats out of literally everything? And now structures are even easier to shoot out?!!! 

Wtf epic. So skilled players will now run through their resources on each other even faster only to die to a couple of trashcan spammers endlessly shooting out your remaining mats? Dope. Reward campy awful gameplay to keep the garbage players engaged.

&amp;nbsp;  
One of our goals for Fortnite is to have a number of ways to play the game and be successful. We’ve identified some strategies that are overly dominant and we’ll be making some adjustments today. Going forward we’ll continue to monitor how we can best support that gameplay variety.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Here are some of the immediate changes coming today!  
&amp;nbsp;      
**Shotguns**
&amp;nbsp;  
For awhile we felt that Shotguns promoted healthy close quarter gameplay, however with the recent equip time changes, Shotguns are being used more often than we like. It's something we've been keeping an eye on, but broadly speaking we feel Shotguns are a little too strong in their current state. As a result, we’re making these adjustments:
&amp;nbsp;  

* Pump Shotgun
 * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
 * Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85
* Tactical Shotgun
 * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0

&amp;nbsp;  
Shotgun consistency across the board is also something we're looking into and aim to improve. We want to make it more apparent when you hit or miss a shot. In addition to that, making sure the accuracy is more consistent and improving other odd behaviors with the weapon is a top priority. We've identified a number of issues that we're currently working on solving in the near future.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Traps**
&amp;nbsp;  
We made a large change to traps a few weeks ago to test decreasing damage from 125 to 75. This was done in an effort to better understand the impact traps have throughout a match. The change sparked a great deal of excellent discussion about traps and we are going to lean more into improving their effectiveness. We want this to add more ways for you to be potent in combat. Here’s the change:

* Trap Damage increased from 75 to 150

&amp;nbsp;  
**Jetpack**
&amp;nbsp;  
The Jetpack was introduced as a Limited Time Item. You can learn more on the goals of Limited Time Items as a concept in this post. 

We will be vaulting the Jetpack at 8am on Monday, June 11. Get in your last matches before then! We may bring back the Jetpack at a future date with some improvements and new changes.

I'm not thinking im going to get my v-bucks back just hoping for epic to add a confirmation. Below is my support email to epic.

Basically, I already had funk ops and the disco harvesting tool so i was spamming in and out of them in the item store. Somehow i entered battlepass tiers (900 v-bucks) and due to purchases not needing a confirmation (e.g are you sure you want to buy this item) i accidently bought it. I have no interest in buying tiers and this is extremely irritating mostly because of my own carelessness but partly due to there not being any confirmation. In the best case scenario for me i get my v-bucks back but I understand if thats against your policy. I understand it was foolish of me since it clearly says it was non-refundable but since this was an accident I'm hoping for you to help me. If you wish not to refund the v-bucks (wich I again would understand) I would atleast pray for you to add an extra confirmation when buying items. Everyone who is not used to the system can very easily buy items by accident so adding an extra confirmation would just add positives.

This is probably going too far but I think it would give people a greater variety of inventory options by removing double pump (double heavy is a rare occurrence), and a greater variety of of short range weapons (I think SMGs and pistols would be more viable as no 'one pumps' give time to use these weapons).

But I still think shotguns would be the best weapon of choice for a very close range fight. I like the idea of each weapon group being the best in a particular situation or range and do not think this would change that.",FortNiteBR

Oh and i play games sometimes to complete the non-combat challenges (that sounds stupid but like its my first shooter game i get bored very quickly but im good with most things except shooting which trashes my stats) [PSN: RmGkillA11] but anyway. I know you guys hate campers im not one myself but i dont think camping is bad. While a high kill win may be satisfying to ***YOU*** it may not be the *ideal* win in a bushcampers eyes. I remember from my very first days of fortnite back before mini shields were released and you could still get purple scoped ars in supply drops (got one in a 1 v 1 Once from a supply drop and i was so triggered) i loved the excitement of seeing a player running past you obliviously it was like being in live spectator mode, almost like playing hide and seek it just felt good for me back then. So i can sympathise with those who camp. It depends on your preferences on how you want to win and what you find fun. I hear a lot of people say ""oh well they can waste their time camping but imma get some kills"" but its all about satisfying your needs. 

When it comes to wins most people think getting that double digit win and being aggressive is the best way to win and it helps you get better. But heres a question. *better at what?* *BEING AGGRESSIVE* *what does camping make you better at?* *NOTHING!* **NO** it makes you better at being stealthy. At the end of the game, the last person standing on 1 hp with 15 kills on top of a massive build battle structure or with 100 100 in a bush was the best person at survival in the lobby. ""Last man standing"" doesnt mean ""get more kills"" its a *choice* which makes the game significantly more interesting for some people. ""Last man standing"" means exactly what it says ""Last man standing"" become the last man standing no matter what your strategy is. Some people have to remember,  being ""better"" at killing isnt necessarily an essential but rather an accessory almost, to make you look better. **SURVIVING** is an essential. You can kill as many people as you want but if you dont survive to get that victory royale, **who cares?! You?!** A win is a win no matter how it happens. It may not be rewarding to you and you may feel like shit getting one pumped by a bush wookie but maybe thats what your opponents plan was. In that game, if you lost its because your opponent was better than you in some way or another. 

Im not saying theres anything wrong with playing aggressive but theres also nothing wrong with playing passively and i dont believe it should be looked down upon just because you fall into their trap every time. If they dont beat you why would you be complaining? Its a meta which you have to evolve to as annoying as it is. One more thing, remember, ***MOST*** not all but ***most*** bush campers and campers arent calculated with their hiding but rather scared of fights and should be no problem to deal with.

2.The player who would chase you for the rest of the game rather than focus on anything else, this goes into the first one since as soon as someone starts building when I shoot them I’ll just leave and go elsewhere but then they’ll decide they do want to fight and won’t stop coming after me.

I choose to play like this because I know I don't have the best aim, I don't have the best building but also because *the game doesn't reward you enough for kills*.  I feel like it is fun to go for kills, but a lot of times it is not the best choice if you're going for the win.

&amp;nbsp;

The killstreaks I'm thinking of would resolve, in some degree, situations like the following:

* A player wins a build battle but because the enemy used up most of the mats he ends up having less than before.

* A player with 0 kills managed to get into the top3, waits for the other two to fight then blasts the winner, usually because the camper is full health while the fighter just survived a close battle with low health remaining.

* In a top10 situation in an open field where there are snipers at play, players are encouraged to build a base and wait for the storm to close in

&amp;nbsp;

There are a myriad of circumstances that could be improved with killstreaks, so I want to give you an example of how they could be implemented. Keep in mind that this is only my idea of how to incorporate them into the game and it may very well be full of problems, so I'd love to hear criticism, modifications or even brand new killstreak systems. 

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

Notes:

* Most rewards aren't given to you directly, they spawn at the corpse of the player you killed.

* **[Drop Grenade]:** A grenade that, when used, spawns a Drop from the sky. Contains the items described below.


Kills | Reward | Explanation
-----|------|-----------
Every kill | 80 random mats (e.g. 14/35/31). This number increases by 20 for every kill. | Relatively solves the problem of running out of mats after a build fight.
Third from last enemy | The positions of the two enemy players remaining are spotted on your map for 3 seconds. | Balances the disadvantage of giving away your position when being agressive, discourages camping in the top 3.
Second from last enemy | Your health and are instantly set to the maximum | Encourages you to be aggressive in the top3 by giving you an instant reset to face the last enemy.
1 | A round of ammo of the weapon you used to kill the enemy | Ensures you have enough ammo to go for the next kill
4 | **Drop Grenade** with the same item you had to the right of the **DG** when throwing it. The copied item will have its rarity increased by one if it can do so. | Upgrades the agressive player's arsenal but also encourages fighting since the other players may want to steal the drop. It can also be used as bait.
7 | The llamas' starting locations are spotted on the map. | Encourages players with +7 kills to go to the same spots.
10 | If you haven't recieved damage for the last 20 seconds, your health regenerates at the rate of 1hp per second. | In the later stages of the game it is a burden to carry health recovery but agressive players still need it.
15 | **Drop Grenade** with a jetpack, x3 of every trap and two chug jugs. | Outplay resources for the late-game.
20 | **Drop Grenade** with The Black Scar and max medium ammo. Same stats as the legendary one, but it destroys buildings much faster. | Negates the ""just build lol"" counter vs players that are having an insane game.
30 | The Black Hole. Item that channels for 20 seconds then spawns a storm, with you as the center, that deals players inside of it 1 damage only to shields every 2 seconds. The storm's center stays at the place where you used it, and the ""safe radius"" is about the same as the second from last circle.| A 30 kill game means that you should be the player of the game, and what better way to do so than creating a storm around you?

Between the unbalance of shotguns, the skill gaps and lack of changes in the game I can’t help but feel like I’m wasting my time playing. 


I’ve been playing since the beginning of season three and never really thought this game would get boring. But now I can’t say that I wake up wanting to play the game like I used to. The past few days I have had to tell myself that it might be fun or try to convince myself to play because I used to really love this game and it used to make me really happy. I tried to play every day

I gave up the hope of winning a match along time ago and just started playing for fun, and it was a lot of fun. Then the double pump came back and all the new LTMs were the same exact thing that we had three months ago. The challenges were a reason to keep playing for a while too but now after getting stuff like trap challenge afterTraps were nerfed and the mini gun and LMG challenge when both are so inconsistent and hard to actually get kills with… The challenges seem more like chores now than actual challenges. 

And half the time I go through the lobby and Queue up into a game only to be shotgunned in the face within the first minute and have to go through it all again. 

Am I the only one that feels like this game isn’t fun anymore?",FortNiteBR

From what I see, this subreddit's front page is mostly media posts, memes and skin suggestions. I think as a community, we should be way more vocal on our opinions on recent changes, although it loud, we need to make it more of a priority to that we are not on the verge of being sick of these changes, but that we are ALREADY sick of it. Not only be more vocal about the changes we don't like, but be vocal about the things we loved. 

My opinion on the recent  changes: 
So personally my biggest gripe with jetpacks is how the only way to fight them is to turtle. So either remove them earl ier or fix how easy it is to grab highground. 

The trap nerf was too much, revert it back to 125 or at least to 100. The trap should be game changing item if you run into it, hearing it in a build fight should put average/good players on high alert enough that they won't run into it, and those same players will be looking for them when they're going around anyways, or else they should be. It was never a problem to begin with. 

The bouncer and the LMG were the only new items I liked. The bouncer although I hate the fact that fall damage is negated with it because it could have opened way more strategic plays with it and got rid of the fact that we have too many ways to avoid fall damage these days, I liked it for it's versatility in fights. Also the LMG was the perfect balance to what the minigun should have been. 
Which brings me to my final gripe- Start vaulting stuff. The minigun, semi sniper, suppressed machine pistol, etc. don't get utilized enough, so you have 2 options, either buff them or get rid of them. I would personally like epic to vault them because there's items in place of them that do a better job at it so when I'm opening a chest I would hope it's these things and not the above. 

I might be alone in this, but I don't think we should have too many things that negate fall damage, highground is a huge advantage right now, and it should have some counter to it if you can't outbuild, because it's not always an option we can do, given mats and the fact that it's a br and can get shot from anywhere. 
I like blitz, its the most fun gamemode imo. 
i liked the pump delay, a 1 shot should not be able to be stacked up even after an edit, however, carry a single one should not be as punishing as it is now.
There's many gameplay changes we want and these skin suggestions and media posts take away from how much we want the changes. 
TL;DR- Your skin suggestions suck and epic isnt going to put them in anyways

438,SHREMMM,1528300570,8p1raz,31,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8p1raz/7_tips_for_you_beginners_out_there_in_need_of/,66,7 Tips For You Beginners Out There In Need Of Your First Victory Royale,"So just a little background info:  Ok by no means am I someone who has hundreds of wins, streaming on Twitch for thousands of viewers, in fact when I'm bored and I do decide to stream on twitch I get at most 1 viewer (If you wanna come watch my Twitch name is mremschel86), but I still have around 75 wins, and about 30 of those from this season alone, so I feel like I am improving a lot and have a pretty good skillset to be able to help people improve.  I play PS4 and PC, but on PC I am not good, but on PS4 however I am a lot better, but still, I am, at most, decently good to pretty good.

Tips: 
1. This is a big one, organize your inventory the same way, every game.  You can choose however way you want, but if you have the same guns in the same slots every game, you will be able to be in the middle of a fight and know where each gun will be, so you don't have to pull out a bolt and accidentally shoot when you think its your pump.

2.  If you are on console, USE BUILDER PRO.  I cannot stress this one enough.  Builder pro is so important to build fast.  I'll admit, I hated builder pro when it first came out.  I kept saying why should I practice learning a new way of building when I already build really fast with combat pro?  But I went into plenty of 20x5 games (the 20v20 game mode) using builder pro, and it helps tremendously.  Just try to learn it.

3. Play around with your sensitivity, and never go down, go up.  I think that playing with a 3 or a 4 and even a 5 sensitivity is useless.  It doesn't help your aim, unless you lower your ADS sensitivity, which I do recommend but I will get to that in the next point.  Your X and Y sensitivity don't affect your aim in any way.  I play on an 8 and go up a tick or 2 every week.  Trust me, do it.

4. Get to know what your settings actually mean.  If you have Edit Mode Aim-Assist turned on, I recommend turning it off, so you can edit faster.  Look through every setting and see what you actually have on and off.  If you don't understand something, look it up. I'm sure every single thing is on this subreddit somewhere, and if not here, google will tell you.  Play around with everything until you see what fits you.

5. Watch streamers.  I know many of you watch Ninja because of how amazing he is, but try to diversify yourself.  You can learn so much from watching a variety of streamers and you can even find one who you might like more then Ninja.  Watch Faze Tfue, watch HighDistortion, watch Daequan, watch Hamlinz, and if you play console, watch NICKMERCS.  All of them are entertaining enough, and out of all of them, HD is probably the least entertaining, but his gameplay is so good and plenty entertaining that I subscribed to him on Twitch.  People don't realize he's number 2 in the world for PC kills, and he can easily drop a 20 bomb.  Tfue I feel is the best Fortnite player in the world, and Daequan and Hamlinz are extremely underrated.  NICKMERCS is also an amazing console player, and you can watch and learn from a console player, instead of a PC player who does other things then you will need to learn as a console player.  

6. I know this contradicts what I just said, but don't use a pump just because that's what your favorite streamer does.  If you aren't good in a shotgun fight, I would recommend using a tact shotgun or a heavy, or even a tact smg.  Tact smg's are underrated by newer players, and can shred through people close range.  If you take a green one, it can still do over 200 damage per second, so you can wipe out a players health in the time they can shoot 1 pump shot.  Ninja does what fits him, not you.  Ninja is an extremely accurate shooter, and makes millions playing Fortnite because he knows what works for him.

7. Play, Play, and Play again.  Don't say ""I dont know how I'm ever gonna win"", I played for a good month or 2 before I got my first win, and if you want to see how terrible I was when I started playing, you can look at my stats here: [My Stats!](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Diseased%20Condom). I've played just over 3,500 games on PS4, and 3,333 games on PC, and managed just about 75 combined wins.  Don't worry, it takes time, you will get there.

8. If you ever want to team up and try to get your first Victory Royale, or just get some more, add me on PS4, my name is SHREMMM

This continually stagnates the meta of high level play. The diversity of weapon types in this game is so vast and interesting but lately the only thing viable to run is double pumps with an AR and meds. Not only is it boring to use double pump in my own gameplay vs every other person using it too, but it’s boring to watch people use it. Every streamer I watch lately runs around double pumping and maybe if us viewers are lucky, picks up a sniper or something else interesting. The entertainment factor is diminished when each round is indistinguishable from the last, due to the sole use of double pumps.

In conclusion, the pump shotgun needs to be heavily rebalanced/nerfed, or possibly even removed to keep the meta game healthy.",FortNiteBR

After they released the results today I noticed that there was a pretty big difference in the score which I had counted (using the points system given by EPIC Games). I am just wondering if anyone else had this issue and if so how big was the difference in score with yours?
This doesn't really effect me as only being placed at 437 but I can imagine for the people around 100 where every point matters this is a pretty big deal especially when the prize for this is VBucks.

We should have to choose among the three types of the shotguns.  Pump has power and a close spread but is slow, tac is fast but weak and has a wide spread, and the heavy has range and speed but lack in power.  They're all so different you would have to choose what works best for you but having the option to carry two and quickly switching between them is a meta that is way too powerful in terms of burst damage and defeats their purpose.  For example, the recent Gold LTM  was so enjoyable because most people didn't have a shotgun let alone two.  

Now people will say you have to give up a slot, just build lol, or it takes skill to switch and maintain accuracy, but wouldn't it also take skill to work with the gun you chose?  Build battles would still exist, which is awesome, but middle and end game would have more battles which would result in more excitement.

I'm just suggesting we see what it would be like to have a disgusting shotgun swapping delay in a new LTM/Shooting Test.   Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. 

Please, don't hate me as I'm just speaking my mind and want to know what others think. ",FortNiteBR

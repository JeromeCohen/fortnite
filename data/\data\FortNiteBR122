Fortnite on Switch can barely run at 30 fps at pretty mediocre graphics settings. Other games, like Warframe, are ported so well that its a shame to see a game like Fortnite run so badly. The least they could do is add a couple different graphics settings, like Rocket League did, so people who aren't real sticklers on graphics quality could have their game run faster. It's even worse on Android, though. You're not gonna have any luck running this game well unless you're using a phone with higher than 4 gigs of ram, which is really confusing considering that the iPhone 8 and X have 2 and 3 gigs of ram respectively and run the game just fine. I understand that even the newest Snapdragon processor isn't up to par with the bionic chips used by Apple, but they're still very powerful, as other graphically demanding games like PUBG Mobile run just fine at high frame rates at max settings, even on slightly dated hardware. So why does Fortnite fall so short? I'm lucky that I play on PC, because I can't imagine having these as my only ways of playing this game. I really hope in the future these versions of the game get more attention and get fixed, because they have so much missing potential.",FortNiteBR

An alternative option to download the mobile textures could be really helpful for people who cannot run the game, whilst not having any sort of advantage. competitive players may like to use this for the same reason that they would use lower settings, more fps and better visibility.

I for one would like this as in some places on the map i struggle to reach 240fps constantly, which isn't great as i have a 240hz monitor, and I would definitely prefer being able to take my graphics down even more to meet this framerate.

&amp;#x200B;

I did see a post over on \[Epic Forums\]([https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/suggestions-advice/213037-pc-graphics-adjustment-with-the-new-mobile-release](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/suggestions-advice/213037-pc-graphics-adjustment-with-the-new-mobile-release)) but it didn't seem to get the traction that it could on reddit.

I've also lost a lot of games against these items. This is what keeps the game fresh for me. If I won every game sniping out of a 3 stack tower or rocket spamming my opponent I would have stopped playing Fortnite awhile ago in all likelihood. I think the addition of new items is why wins feel fun for me. It gives me different obstacles to overcome and out maneuver. It makes wins feel different and losses a new learning experience. Do I get mad when I plane takes me out of my tower. Sure! Do I feel good when I knock a guy out of his tower? Sure do! 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else feel the same?  


To me this ever changing field of items, terrain, movement abilities is why Fortnite works in my opinion. I try to never hate on a new item on day 1. Sure do things need to be tweaked and adjusted, of course, but if Fortnite was exactly how it was 3 or 4 seasons ago I think people would have moved on to other games by now. If you can't adjust and adapt where is the fun in winning the same old way every time?

Planes are obviously imbalanced. There is no question there. Planes can outright kill an opponent or even knock them off a cliff or build and instant kill.

I feel like fortnite is the type of game that should have counters and by having that you have a competitive game where you can outplay your opponents. For the longest time building has been the primary source of skillful gameplay. You can be aggressive by being a good builder and pushing someone, or you can choose to build defensively.

I've been playing Fortnite BR since late season 1. Heres my opinion: Back in the early seasons, building was your primary goal. Being aggressive was extremely rewarding due to the materials and heals opponents often had as well as upgrades (most notably the scar) or explodes. Now being aggressive is extremely difficult. Most players have become better builders with new techniques like 90's and better protected ramping as well as better turtling. But the main issue has become the third partying. With all the methods of travel (Rift, rift to go, quad, planes etc) people are just being suicidal and aggressive. In the earlier seasons it was easier to find an opponent (often alone or 1 other nearby) and eliminate them and move to the next location. Rotating was also always in the back of your mind because there weren't these insane ways to get around, so you needed to be wary of your location and often times you would see someone and look and see 30 seconds till storm moves and a decent journey ahead. So you would try to sneak by undetected and not engage.

Now let's look at today's fortnite. Sure the map has been updated, there are more points of interest which is awesome! In fact, I'd love to see far more loot on the map and far more ways to find weapons and meds. But now planes are scattered throughout the map at least 20 planes are in the map at one time.

* On the mountain by Loney Lodge
* Located between Fatal Fields and Paradise Palms on a hill
* West of Dusty Divot on the mountain
* South of Lazy Links by the river
* Northeast of Pleasant Park on the mountain
* The hangers at Frosty Flights
* Between the mountains north of the unnamed soccer stadium by the Viking Village
* On the mountain north of Happy Hamlet
* And a few other spots have been changed (I.e house near retail has one inside of it)

Vehicles, in my opinion, are a great addition. Rotations were extremely hard in fortnite, and vehicles provided a method to get into safe zones much easier. I have had zero issues or complaint about the quad and the golf cart I think the shopping cart was just a troll. Often times I would find myself in an extended fight at paradise or retail or something and all the sudden the zone is coming and the quad at paradise or salty saves me from the storm which is awesome!

But now that planes are here, it changes the game in a very negative fashion. They are extremely effective and destructive to the game.

What planes offer:

\#1 They are the best vehicle in means of rotating,

\#2 They are the best means of surviving until late game storms. Afking far into the sky on the outskirts. Sure people would love to shoot them down but often times revealing your position or trying to waste precious ammo is not worth it or drawing attention from the plane and they skydive you and kamikaze.

\#3 Planes can outright kill you. Shooting for 40 damage a shot with what feels like explosive burts with a fast machine gun. Or the Ram which does like 50 damage and or fall damage to death.

The point:

Planes should be like quads, they should provide transportation at a high risk. Take a quad through the entire middle of the map see how long you live. That's right not very long. Quads are great as a last resort to rotate which is why they are balanced. Take a plane through the middle? Often times you are extremely safe, sure lots of people like to target planes and shoot you down but more often than not you will be fine. Or you can just dive out without any issues. Obviously if you position your plane poorly a good player can do damage to you with good aim.

How to balance:

Planes should NOT do damage. There should not be guns on a plane. Planes for squads players should be allowed to shoot just like off the back of a quad or golf cart. That is balanced.

Planes should NOT be allowed to break builds. Ramming should only break things when taking off the ground or maybe make raming structures do significantly more damage so 90% of the time if you ram a build you will blow up your own plane and take damage.

Planes have a lot of HP. I feel like planes are far tankier than they should be. They should be able to be shot down far easier than they are.

Planes cannot ram players. Thus not doing damage from ramming, and not pushing players miles in the sky.

TLDR

I think maybe they should half the HP of planes, remove the damage taken when a plane blows up, and not allow players to ram builds like they currently can. Also the removal of the machine guns.

Earlier seasons had far better fights with less third partying and more countering with skill which the current meta lacks.",FortNiteBR

I have 44 wins (1 solo, 12 duos, 31 squads) out of 237 matches so currently 18.5% win rate in Season 7. I have average aim and I‚Äôm the guy crouched behind a rock while my enemy builds the Taj Mahal. I win games not through better mechanics but through better strategy and communication.

I have the most fun in squads because this is where good communication is most important. I stream on Xbox One and play almost exclusively with my viewers. They average around 1-2 k/d and have win rates between 1%-8% for season 7. 

Here are some of my tips to win more games in duos and squads!

1. Designate a team leader. You want to pick someone to make the callouts during the game. It's good to always get feedback from everyone but you need someone in charge to decide when to fight, when to back away and where to go during the game. 
2. Pick a landing spot. This one sounds straightforward but don't just say ""Pleasant Park"". Decide where in that location you want to land. For instance, if you pick Pleasant Park what houses are you going to land at? 
3. Stick together. The easiest way to get squad wiped when you land is getting split early game. If you land in a location like Pleasant Park make sure to have two people to a house and that the houses are adjacent to each other. It's also a good idea to pick a fallback location before you drop in case your first spot gets contested. 
4. Don't push alone. Even if you see a default skin that looks like a noob make sure your teammates are with you. One lucky shot with no one around means you'll get finished. The advantage of squads is that you have your teammates to support you. It's always hard to hold back when you see an easy kill but it's important to wait until the rest of your team is in position. There could always be another team waiting to 3rd party.
5. Don't go in a fight one at a time. If you watch good solo squad players they win because they know how to section off a fight and attack players individually. Even a squad of inexperienced players can win against a pro player if they focus together instead of going into the fight separately. 
6. Callout what you are doing. I can't stress this point enough! Are you throwing grenades at the enemy? Are you sniping someone on a hill? Are you backing off from the fight to heal? Always make sure to tell your team what you're doing.
7. It's our loot. Part of being an effective squad is knowing everyone's strength's and weakness so that each player has the best loot. If I know someone on my team is better at shotguns than me (usually everyone üòÇ) I will make sure they have the first legendary we find. If I'm playing cross-play with a PC player I make sure they have the first sniper. Prioritize who gets what loot regardless who finds it.
8. Mix up your loadouts. When playing squads not everyone has to carry the same items or weapons. I go without a shotgun a lot in squads because I take a more supportive role in fights while others position more aggressively. The advantage of a squad is you have up to 20 slots to carry items. I see players naturally splitting up heals but most ployers don't think to carry a weapon loadout based on what others are carrying.
9. Observe first and fire second. Another common pitfall is firing at an enemy as soon as you see them. In squads and duos it's important to scout out the locations of the entire team before engaging. You want to find the person most separated from the enemy team and then sync your firing on them to knock them out before they have a chance to react. 
10. I got BM‚Äôed. Even when your finished you can still help your squad! I‚Äôve won games just helping coach my teammates and calling out what everyone is doing so they can focus on the fights. This is really helpful. 
11. Play LTMs. When you have a limited set of items like in high explosives or sniper shootout there is a lot less RNG involved for items. You‚Äôre not going to go up against someone that has a gold scar while you only have a gray burst. Top players also do not usually play these modes so the skill range is much more balanced for casual players.
12. Have fun! This is the most important. Remember it‚Äôs a video game. Focus on having a good time with your friends and you will win more games. 

I hope you find my post useful. If you want to hop on some squads with me sometime please check out my stream and Instagram! I‚Äôve met so many great players and looking forward to meeting more.

However I do not think its the case with fortnite and there should not be items that are innately opposing building such as splodes which destroy way to many walls to make sense or utility items like tnt or boombox (maybe even grapples). Claiming that people that incorporate building in their gameplay should be somehow ""countered"" is quite absurd. It is the same thing as saying that people should have aimbot or wh in csgo to counter people who use crosshair placement and recoil control to gain an advantage or annalise gameplay to predict enemy movement. It is the same thing as claiming that items should be free in league to counter people who cs more or get more kills and lastly it is the same as claiming everyone should have unlimited boost in rocket league because some people manage theirs better. It boggles my feeble mind that the core of what fortnite is is being questioned even by a teeny tiny minority, to me it is absolutely baffling. Without its core, which is building, fortnite to me is unappealing to say the least, it has a wonky shooting system, bloom and bad terrain with little actual indestructible cover. Why has epic decided to forget what the game is? Are they catering to casuals like everyone likes to say? Or maybe they do not know themselves what fortnite will become much like paragon. All I can say is that the current choices that Epic is making do not seem to be good for the game and look like they are more influenced by short term gain resulting in a long term loss more than anything. I would be happy to hear from you guys what are your thoughts on this matter. 

TL;DR building should not be tampered with as it is the core of what fortnite is ",FortNiteBR

I had gotten all of the loot in that spot, so I wasn‚Äôt worried when I saw a Lynx just gliding down (I guess he had a late landing) 

He landed next to me and the second his feet hit the ground, he started dancing. 

Now to give a little context as to what I do after that, I should probably say that I hate dealing with the annoying people in BR. (The cheaters, the teamers, the people who dance 0.1 second after killing you, the people who just kamikaze into you with planes) so whenever I have the opportunity to do any of those things, I don‚Äôt. See, I believe what goes around comes around, so I always try to be a nice person, so in return others will be nice to me. 

I know that sounds stupid, and it‚Äôs just a video game, but I think that‚Äôs instinct just carries over from real life. Anyways, back to the story

So the Lynx started dancing, and I had tons of weapons that I easily could‚Äôve killed them with, but I started dancing instead. Eventually, after like 30 seconds of dancing he stopped, so I just used a balloon and hopped over to shifty.

Later on in the match, while I was looting shifty, I saw them again, and they had weapons. They could‚Äôve easily killed me but they didn‚Äôt, the started dancing and walked off towards tilted.

That was exactly what I was talking about when I said I believe that what goes around comes around. I didn‚Äôt think much of that after the match ended for me (I died in like 27th or something) so I started another match. I started playing like I normally do, until I got a notification from PlayStation Messages.

The person who I decided not to kill, had taken the time out of their life to go back into replay, find out what my name was, and message me, just to thank me for letting him live.

He thanked me not only for letting him go, but thanked me because he ended up winning that match (he included a screenshot)

The solution is already present, just not quite what it needs to be. The boom box.

You throw the thing like 3 feet and it takes ages to arm. What I like to do is approach someones build, throw it from afar-ish sice it has a lengthy arm time, then run in and start shooting.

But even when im in close range, the throw distance is absolutely pathetic.

Namely in particular, im so sick of people holding down the build button for an impenetrable wall. wall dies? Immediately built again no bullets get through.

I propose a number of fixes but only really one needs done.

A) When a piece of a building dies, it takes .75 seconds before youre allowed to place another piece there.

This will stop the ""impenetrable wall"". In solos its ungodly infuriating and im forced to use the most try hard methods possible just to get to him. In duos its not as bad.

B) increase the throwig range of the boom box

Right now, the boom box has such a short throwing range you already need to be in the thick of it, so why have it be thrown at all? Reward proactive play.

C) decrease the arm time on the boom box.

If youre already in the thick of it, you shouldnt have to throw it, wait for it to arm, THEN start blowing up random pieces.",FortNiteBR

The first series of problems in season 7 started in patch v7.00

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-00](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-00)

&amp;#x200B;

First off we have the introduction of the  X-4 Stormwing Plane (and I think this is really the problem with season 7), and with it a new meta.  Yep just fly into your opponents, shooting away, if the  mounted machine gun doesn't get you, with 30 damage per hit, then the damage you take when it crashes into you almost certainly will.   Or you can just push someone off the edge of a mountain, so they die of fall damage - not sure that is what the developers intended players to do.

Not to mention at some point some users were experiencing serious lag, which definitly does not improve gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-01](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-01)

&amp;#x200B;

Realising that the X-4 was overpowered, players took 25 damage,  it definitly was a good start, but this patch also promptly introduced the  Infinity Blade,  the player who had that had not only had double the health and sheild of every other player (400 hp) but were also given increased speed (130%),  turning even the worst player into a killing machine.  There was no skill involved really.  With 75 damage per hit, the player with the infinity blade could easily hack through a player's 200 hp before they got through the nessesary damage, the increased speed also allowed the bearer to avoid most hits anyway.  Combined with a virtual immunity to fall damage and an ability to jump huge distances, made the  Infinity Blade  a terrible opponent to face.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-10?sessionInvalidated=true](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-10?sessionInvalidated=true)

&amp;#x200B;

I think no-one is going to complain about patch 7.10 #1, we got the 14 Days Of Fortnite, and various patches that improved the game overall.  

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere along the line Epic also fixed another mistake they made by vaulting the Infinityle Blade.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-10-content-update-2](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-10-content-update-2)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the update right now, and we have the boombox, Bringing all fights to a ground level.  With this new weapon, killing an opponent just comes down to who has the best aim, and most health.  There is no chance of building to escape or rotection  as it gets through fully built metal in a  matter of seconds.  

&amp;#x200B;

**I think a lot of players are getting angry with this.**

&amp;#x200B;

And to be honest, I am too.  I've been playing since season 4 and I have never experienced such frustration as I am this season.   I'm not great, I am not a match against a lot of players, I barely win games, but still being able to kill opponents by driving into them is not something I feel is helping the game at all.  Nor is being able to destroy every structure they build, or having one almost god-like player, even pros will struggle to rival.

What is Epic trying to do here?   It's not improving the skill of players, it's just giving the opponent with the best loadout, the win.

I started playing Fortnite in the beginning of S1 and played on a (in my opinion) pretty high level. I quitted the game at the end of S5 with a solo win percentage of over 40%.

I've seen it all. Pump snipers, double pump, splode meta, smg meta. But boy was I wrong when I thought double pump would be the biggest issue this game could have.

I think what made Fortnite this big and attractive to esports was its mix of simplicity and variety. The game itself was simple. Colorful, easy to understand, easy to spot enemys and comicy to not lose fun over stress/reality. 

That said, the skill ceiling was high from the beginning of S1 and evolved itself as the players evolved. We still see new build tactics each day on the competitive sub and I don't think that Epic can assume when we finally reach the ceiling and found out about every viable tactic. 

And exactly this is the reason I think they've gone too far.

Fortnite is all about experimenting with the things we have - the biggest of all being building. The players learn by themselves, learn together and evolve as a community. Pros pull off new tactics and the community tries to follow them, tries to improve it even more.

While that happens Epic seems to try each and every possible thing to destroy that process. 

* Splode meta (damage through the first hit structure with rpgs and gls and C4 having 1.200 range) was the first time they punished good players/builders. To give some context: You've played this game for months, improved your building and shooting. You're in a build fight against another players, outplay him totally and he throws a C4 to not only break down your building, but rather your months of learning and improving. 

* After they finally nerfed explosives we got the smg meta and while S5 itself was in a good state when it began, the smg meta was another hell for builders and good players. While you tried to outbuild your opponent, he just stood under your building and spammed his 50 shot 290dps P90 to laser your builds and you with hipfire.

* After they nerfed smgs they introduced the quad launcher. Players complained about the rpg from the beginning, because it has always been a cheesy way to destroy buildings but at least they took back the damage through structures. But then they implement a rocket launcher with a 4 rocket magazine? Who asked for that? Who gave the impression that **this** is the item we needed in the game?

* But wait, it got worse. They had to remove ATK's, the first vehicles in Fortnite, which have been fun to use and easy to counter - the perfect spot - for quad crashers. A vehicle that not only makes paying attention to the storm irrelevant but rather is a mashine to shred down whole buildings with extra low risk by just crashing through them.

* They added grapplers (yes before the other two items, I know) so when you got outbuilt, you just have to grapple your way back up. Players who established high ground just had to deal with the fact that their opponent found an item that replaced their months of training by a single click.


**Fast forward to Season 7**

Now we have planes that crash through structures and give everyone an easy high ground while being fast, having unlimited ammo and no penalty when the plane is destroyed because of redeploy.

We have turrets that give you a high health ground instantly plus an unlimited ammo high damage turret to fuck over builders even more.

We had a fucking infinity blade in the default gamemodes that made it to million dollar tournaments and slashed through builds with simple swings.

What's next to come?

What else will Epic try to punish good players, good builders, that made the game what it is today? 
Without the players who evolved with the system and found out all those strategys and tactics, Fortnite would still be a 1x1 single ramp bloom shooter.
But it isn't - because of those people that Epic punish over and over and over again.

I haven't played the whole of S6 and only played 7 games in S7. I won 3 of them. So I am not salty, I'm sad. Sad that we now got a boombox to make it even easier to destroy buildings. Sad that I lost my drive to play the first game, that I ever reached top tier skill in. 

And while Epic tries to change the game almost weekly and seem to never satisfy their community, they don't seem to understand that what needs to change the most out of all, is their vision of what the game needs to reach its full potential as an esport.

Thanks for reading if anyone got this far.

My sister's new to Fortnite, having only played Battle Royale casually for a few weeks now. She doesn't normally enjoy video games, so Fortnite must be pretty special for her to actively come back to it regularly.

#####Help Wanted!
Earlier today, whilst playing a Team Rumble match she flew to Dusty Divot to escape the fighting for a bit after re-spawning. As she was landing, we spotted a lone Dire pickaxing remains of the research facility (I'm assuming for quite a while considering most of it was already gone). After spotting her, they came running over. After going around in a circle for a bit, and missing all her shots (she's still not great at close combat) I told to stop, noticing the Dire hadn't taken a single shot at her (they only had their pickaxe out too).

The Dire proceeded to drop their entire inventory of weapons and repeatedly used the True Love emote. After playing around and emoting together for a bit (no one else was at Dusty) my sister wanted to add them as a friend. With the match ending soon, and no way to tell who they were without eliminating them, I told her that she would have to shoot them to do so. Refusing to, the match ended as she dropped a golden hand cannon as she tried to signal them to eliminate her.

Team mode replays weren't enabled so I couldn't check afterwards...

This season, I‚Äôve been hitting a lot of Team Rumble etc and noticed I was starting to get a bit better. Not good, but better than I was.

Than I got a daily challenge to finish top 12 in squads, which is a mode I never play, but figured I would stop re-rolling and see if I could find a squad to carry me to that snowman umbrella.

Load in and we land Pleasant. Sadly my team dies within about 3 minutes. I kill the last guy in the area and heal up blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic tries to nerf building again and again, but what if they just made it more accessible to build efficiently instead? It is the feature that makes Fortnite unique and fun, they should never try to ""get rid of it"", but obviously, if you start Fortnite now, it's going to be very frustrating and you will likely have a hard time killing a single ennemy (it's quite normal for a 2 years game without any ranked play).

&amp;#x200B;

What I want is a ""instant build"" on PC! Instead of having 4 keys to use to select the parts, you'd have the button to enter build mode, and then instead of choosing your piece with the scrollwheel and placing it with the left click, you'd simply have 4 instant build buttons (that can be left and right click).

&amp;#x200B;

An example: You press Q to enter build mode. You can then place builds with the left click, right click, scrollwheel click and mouse 3 / E.

&amp;#x200B;

This would, IMO, allow new players to build more easily and even the pros would be happy with it I guess. Right now, even the pros are rusty after a few days off the game. It shouldn't be required to play 10+ hours a week to be able to play.

&amp;#x200B;

If the building was easier, it would switch the skill gap to strategy and speed, not raw mechanical skill. Just how many players who have less than 10 hours a week to play the game are still playing? This is what Epic is trying to fix with their awful changes (boombox for example) but I think it's the wrong approach to the problem. I know we aren't using building as intended (build bases slowly and keep it) but it's what the community wants; Epic shouldn't ruin the game trying to make us play the way they want.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to criticize the idea or defend Epic without any logic. Bye :)",FortNiteBR

I do understand Epic needed their Christmas vacation, but the game is getting so fucking ridiculous due to the bugs and getting to the point where it may be unplayable. 
So, I‚Äôm just going to list all the bugs that I have encountered that need to be fixed.
1. Vibration of character bug- when this occurs your figure will violently shake making you think your lagging, but your not. The cause is not totally known, as it may happen after sliding on the ice lake or using a jump pad. 
2. Rift glitch- this happens after figuring and results in the player not being able to glide because the players character will move very slowly.
3. Skydiving glitch- I have seen this one rarely but it does occur. This is when a player is seen skydiving in the ground. This results inaccurate shots due to the players opponents not being able to tell where their opponents body is.
4. Flipping plane glitch- if the player attempts to flip a plane that is lying on its back, the player may take damage:
5. Plane flying glitch- if a plane is stuck in a build and a player attempts to fly it, the player may instantly die and the plane may have a spasm.
6. Zip line glitch- if a player enters a zip line the player may be propelled forward to the ground which may result in death. 
Now here comes the playground glitches...
1. Not being able to leave match or select anything in the menu after going into playground (results in having to restart just to get back to lobby.)
2. Not being able to jump. 
Alright, thank you for yearning out. Please let me know if any other glitches you may have experienced or if you have experienced any of the said glitches, thanks.

But I have serious issues with inconsistent starts. Maybe it‚Äôs just the battle royale game structure, but I feel like I could be doing better. I know the basics of hitting the ground first: 1.5 squares away from desired target, fall straight down, all that shit. Is there something I‚Äôm missing? Does it just take more practice? I purposely drop in populated areas because I value the experience I gain from it and I think my odds are honestly better than if I dropped in the middle of nowhere and had to make do with some white tier shit weapon and no other loot.

I think I just need some good, unconditional tips that apply in every scenario. Ways to avoid getting instantly dicked on.

But old vaulted items arent what makes this mode fun. Its all the stuff thats in normal modes that are removed here. No planes.....no turrets.....no quad launcher.....no grapplers....no dynamite....no boom boxes....You get the point.

Look i get it, some people enjoy those items. But this is all the more reason to give us competitive playlists with more basic gameplay mechanics. Unvaulted has no shield, limited weapons, and is only ever available in one team size, which isnt that great.

I'm not saying there's no counter to rockets, I'm just pointing out that if everyone is relying on them to win games that tells you something about those weapons. I don't need to sit here and type out everything that makes rockets unbalanced, its been talked about many times on here. Just wanted to point out the percentage of players in top 10 situations with rocket launchers is insanely high almost every game and I think we can all agree on that.

TL,DR: Rockets are OP

My solution:

make players reload the RPG every time they shoot it so they cant switch weapons or build immediately after firing until its reloaded to add a risk/reward factor.

convert the quadlauncher to an anti-vehicle weapon only. make it lock on to vehicles and only do damage to vehicles. it will not be able to fire unless locked onto a vehicle.

adjust the splash radius of all splodes so that the further you are from the blast the less damage you will take

provide less rocket inventory space - something like 3 or 4 total rockets

slow down the trajectory speed of RPGs

heres one im not sure about but thought id add to see if anyone agrees: make the rockets not fly perfectly straight

I know epic probably wont do anything with the current way splodes are in the game but I really hope they do. I know not everybody will agree with all of my solutions and thats okay",FortNiteBR

With a popular game comes popular streamers and the chance for newer streamers to grow their audience as the game grows, meaning the Fortnite streaming / content creator market is FLOODED! 

I see on this sub alone so many daily posts from people sharing their clips in the hope that they can get more ‚Äòfans‚Äô. I just wanted to say to those people, you are attempting to grow an audience in an already crowded space, your content needs to be on point as does your streamer ‚Äòetiquette‚Äô. This means low quality video and/or audio is a no go, boring content is a no go, copying what every other Tom, Dick &amp; Harry is already doing, is a NO GO! 

It is still possible to grow a channel with this game imo, but to do so you need to think outside the box. Don‚Äôt give us the same old bullshit that we‚Äôve seen a thousand times, be original.

I‚Äôm a console player and I don‚Äôt know what to do to improve at this game. I‚Äôve watched multiple videos and have tried to follow them. I‚Äôve watched videos on building, aiming, Q&amp;A‚Äôs from streamers, and all of the the sorts. No matter what I do I can t improve. I spawn into a match, I die. I try to build, I get fucked over because of a stupid boom box. I squad up, my friends die and I have to solo regardless. I‚Äôve tried aim practicing and many other thing to improve but nothing is helping. 

Also, some of the mechanics in this game are not helping me at all. I‚Äôve seen Gromsky y‚Äôall about using auto aim to my advantage. The problem, auto aim works 50/50. I can literally have someone in my reticle tracking and the auto aim won‚Äôt work. Sometimes I can have someone jumping around outside of my reticle and it tracks just fine. Another thing is this game does not register my shots. I‚Äôve shot so many people in the face for 0 damage. I get shot with a common weapon with 200 health and die even if I try to build to the best of my ability. This game is stressful to me. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm considering to drop it again. It‚Äôs not fun, the mechanics don‚Äôt work half the time, and it‚Äôs too floaty for my to even be consistent.

Something is in the sky..

It's a little bigger..

Probably a star?

Wait... No, that's a comet... Shit

It's bigger

Wait, no, it's a meteor... fuck.

Meteor's are falling and interrupting our build battles, fuck you space!

\----------

Season 4:

The big boy meteor just came down and fucked up Dusty, wait, only half of it but JESUS THAT LAND IS NOW A CRATER. #RIPSaltyFactories

There's this fuckboy bunker in Wailing Woods now...

Also there's a drive-in theater now in the top-right corner of the island.

Wait, did I mention, there's cool rocks from space that make funny things happen in the craters.

When the meteors were raining, the jail in Moisty Mire was destroyed and this guy and his gang of evil people got out and are now in there base in a mountain.

The superheros are bamboozled and are now hunting him and his friends down.

The divot is now starting to grow grass and trees.

The meteor in the center of the lab in the crater just hatched and this robot-alien ass came out.

There's a huge fucking fight going down in Tilted of the villains and superheroes

SURPRISE! IT WAS A FILM AND THE VILLAINS AND SUPERHEROES WERE ACTORS!

All these rocks from the craters are at the villain base from the film and the craters are being filled in.

I forgot to mention, there's a rocket prop in the villain base made with REAL FUCKING METAL, dumbasses.

The ""Visitor"" from the crater just hacked the rocket or something and made it real.

The tvs are starting to countdown.

HOLY SHIT THE ROCKET JUST GOT YEETED INTO THE AIR AND FUCKED UP THE SKY.

The cracks in the sky just took away Durrr Burger... pray for Durrr..

\----------

Season 5:

This fuckboy named Drift vandalized the Durrr Burger took to California in this weird place called ""America""

It's back now and brought with it the fuckboy, vikings, copied California, and gave us Golf Carts.

Drift met Brite Bomber, Cuddle Team Leader, and Rex and are now going on a road trip.

The Tomato on top of the pizzeria in Tomato Town just got rifted away to the stone age.

It's replaced with a miniature stone tomato man.

It's back and now, the pizzeria is gone and replaced with a cult's temple, worshiping a fucking TOMATO.

Drift and his squad just visited the place.

The motel sign is back and featuring... *drums* the Enforcers!

There's this big ass cube now in Paradise Palms.

It's moving now.

It just made a rune thing with an anti-gravity dome around it.

The cube shall now be named Kevin

Kevin made alot of runes.

He got a little dirty while doing it and now needs to take a bath.

He tried taking a bath in Loot Lake and just became one with the lake

Now the lake is bouncy

\----------

Season 6:

Kevin just yeeted out the Loot Lake island and made a portal with funny clouds.

Kevin's island is starting to move for some reason..

It just succed the power from the runes he left in the last season.

It did that to all of them until on the last one they all got tired of his lazy ass and went TO Kevin's island.

Kevin being the dick he is, left them on the ground, powerless..

He's back where he started at Loot (Leaky) Lake.

He made a weird portal in the sky cause why not! The sky has suffered enough you dick.

Kevin and his island just shattered.

Now there's weird zombie things around the map.

Everyone on the island just banded together and fucked over Kevin and his army.

Kevin got sad and started crying into the funny cloud portal in the lake.

Kevin sadly spun around.

He's fast as fuck boy.

\*baboom\*

Shit, Kevin's dead, we're all in a different universe.

A rift?

Butterfly rift?

Prettyyyyy..

OH FUCK THE LAKE IS FIXED!

Peaceeee....

Robot man with a plan is here.

There's a weird cloud in the distance...

Wait...

Snow?

Wait..

THAT'S A FUCKING ICEBERG!

SHIT!

\----------

Season 7:

The whole christmas gang is chilling, yuletide ranger, nog ops, the whole crew!

Watching a christmas special with Crackshot!

wait what's that noise...

waht the fuck

ICEBERG, THE FUCK..

wait

someone's on the ice 

It's... Santa!

\*happy\*

Wait.. snowmen soldiers....

\*afraid\*

This ain't Santa! He has a fucking sword! He's bringing in his army!

\*planes coming to wreck your shit\*

Now there's snow everywhere in the southwest corner of the map!

The iceberg brought with it a castle with an evil ice king in it.

It's melting now!

The army guys are nice, it's just a simple misunderstanding.

The soldiers are now giving everyone on the island presents!

The king has woke

Than I got a daily challenge to finish top 12 in squads, which is a mode I never play, but figured I would stop re-rolling and see if I could find a squad to carry me to that snowman umbrella. 

Load in and we land Pleasant. Sadly my team dies within about 3 minutes. I kill the last guy in the area and heal up blah blah blah. 

Fast forward and I‚Äôm suddenly in the final 7. Then 5. Then 3. 

Than it happens. 

The opponent loses me as I inflate two balloons and hover like a hawk out for blood. Suppressed AR in hand, I unload 4 bullets into his dome. 

Slow motion, victory banner. I actually did it. 

I know y‚Äôall are winning every day and I see people hitting outrageous trick shots that I could never dream of making, so this isn‚Äôt a big deal at all, and I know that. But with no friends who play the game, I needed to let someone know.

S4 - Sprays

S5 - Toys

S6 - Lobby Music

S7 - Wraps

We've gotten pretty much all we've requested already, and if Epic continues to follow their pattern of introducing new cosmetic things every season, it's very likely that we'll get hats in S8! If we don't get them next season, I think the new component introduced will be banner decorations; things like borders, secondary colors, optimization to the kill screen so that more than zero people will ever see your banner other than you, etc.

What do you guys think would be the craziest hat combination, or what would be the best looking, or even what characters would look best with a removable hat? Let me know!",FortNiteBR

""They had a pump and I did not"" has really become a thing. Before if someone tried to hit you with a pump and missed your head, if you had a pistol you still had a chance to fight back after taking 80/85 damage from a pump body shot.

The heavy shotgun has been alienated. It can not one shot full health and a body shot does substantially less damage than a pump. I don't like when items are vaulted out rightly because it feels like the item's development time went to waste, so instead of vaulting the purple/gold pump, simply remove the lowest tier preexisting pump( green) and adjust the damage values.

Blue pump 80 damage, purple pump 85 damage and gold pump 90 damage. With these new values, change the headshot multiplier to 2.5. This way, the current setup of blue pump+ still can 1 shot full health while making off spawn fights more balanced and restoring function to heavy shotguns.

I'm okay with that, but the problem is the big majority of the players on the games I play are greatly superior to me skill wise. There is no way I can win a 1v1 and I have played like 20-30 games, only way I get kills is by waiting for a 1v1 to end and kill the winner while he picks up the loot.

In the current meta of fortnite, it requires basically no skill to get a kill, if you are lucky enough. IMO, these are the things that should be removed from the game

Planes: Well, doesn't it sound a bit stupid that you can fly through and destroy all kinds of layers in a matter of seconds, and at the same time deal a shit ton amount of damage to your opponents, in the luckiest case, you can literally one shot someone without doing practically nothing.

Boomboxes: Well, do I even have to describe this in any way? The stupidest item that has been added after the sword, don't understand why the item is still in the game. One of the items that destroy the main reason why this game is played: building. 

Console Aim-Assist: I know, the aim assist doesn't help you that much, but when talking about the burst rifle, the assist makes absolutely no sense. And yes, I have played with a console and tested out the aim assist. I am not saying that it should be removed but at least when talking about the burst rifle, some adjustments need to be done. Atm, you can shoot 3 bullets straight without any bloom.

I think that epic is trying to take Fortnite into a too casual type of a game which IMO is a very bad thing.

I am not saying that this text is correct nor is it based on anything but own opinions. I only want to have some discussion over these topics and hopefully can hear some of your opinions as well. (Wrote this fast af, so there might be some mistakes)

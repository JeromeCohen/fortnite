What is that you say? They deserve to dominate so hard up close? Well maybe that would be true if closing the distance in this game wasn't ridiculously easy between building, impulses, and launch pads. 

Dying to shotguns is infuriating, as nothing feels worse than to play for ten minutes, only to have your run ended by a low-skill one-shot weapon. 

There, I said it. Shotguns are low skill. The only thing in this game that should one shot is the sniper rifle, and that is because it is hard to use and leaves you vulnerable.

Playing the solid gold game mode made fortnite way more fun for me. Why? Because there were no shotguns in it...",FortNiteBR

I'm starting to not feel that optimistic about the game's long term survival, and that really feels bad because I think the game has a really good concept, but the recent changes really seem to cement the sad fact that Epic is starting to see Fortnite as a trendy and popular game, and therefore is hellbent on cashing in and making casual players feel like they don't have to work as hard to get good at the game.",FortNiteBR

* Make the rocket travel slower.
* Make the RPG do less damage to players and more to structures.

You're ready to have a good fight with an enemy player thinking you're playing on relatively equal standing (shields and health aside). You build closer to them hoping to land a nice shotgun shot or to gain the high ground or what have you. All of a sudden they pull out a rocket launcher and shoot it anywhere in your general direction. You lose.

On a real note, it seriously feels like when another player has a rocket launcher and you do not, they have such an advantage in almost every situation. There's no worse feeling then getting splashed with rocket damage when there is almost no time to react, regardless of what health, shields, weapons, or utility you have.

I think there needs to be a buffer on rockets that makes it so that, once fired, rockets have about 1.5 to maybe 2 seconds before they are able to do the full amount of damage as they do right now.

Hear me out.,"Alright so @TwoEpicBuddies on Twitter just tweeted that he's decrypted the morse code for the televisions found in the game files. Apparently, the morse code spells out ""They don't want us to k..."", and of course, this is accompanied by an image of a llama.

The llamas have been around for over a month in-game now, and when you search them, they provide you with 500 of each material, along with some healing equipment and shields, but most importantly, no weapons. Why is this? BECAUSE THEY COME IN PEACE AND DON'T SEE US AS A THREAT! 

They just suddenly started appearing one day, three per map, often in very obscure locations due to the random spawn nature. And that's why they've been here for so long before the rest of their kind come down and land; they were scouting out the planet, making sure it was safe for the other llamas to land here.

I've posted a slightly more detailed version of this [here on Twin Galaxies](https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/1211/fortnite-morse-code-decrypted-they-dont-want-us-to-k/12), along with a [much more detailed theory](https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/1209/tilted-towers-getting-struck-by-a-meteor-why-not-the-entire-fortnite-map/12) earlier today about the entire map being wiped out, not just Tilted Towers.

One of them being TODAY, Tomorrow. Many believe that this means Tilted is being hit today. No. What I believe is that today is the first day of either 

A) counting down the days till the invasion/Landing
B) the first wave of spacecrafts/the first spacecraft landing.

This is because, as you all may know, a llama appears on every TV screen in Fortnite. When approached, it gives off an EAS(emergency alert system)-like noise. 

On the screen, there are five black boxes, one with an arrow pointing down on the one to the far left. This could either mean:

A) One day counted till season 4
B) the first set of spacecrafts/the first spacecraft is set to land.

Tomorrow, there could be two arrows. This means two days counted till season 4, 3 left to go.

When I was playing fortnite today, I was strangely kicked off from my game, and I was told the servers were down. Yet, whenever the servers are normally down, it has never kicked me off, and there’s at least one or two of my friends still in a game. But it seems that NOBODY is on Fortnite right now. All the servers are down. (This is simply opinionated and might not have as many factual statements to back it up).

Anyway, the sign that says tomorrow(today), the one arrow pointing down meaning either it’s counting down the days or the first wave is coming, the broadness and sharpness of people being kicked off, and the message on Epic Games’ Twitter, I think I solved it.

And yes, probably 15 of you are going to comment and downvote, I’m just giving my two cents.

See you on the Battle bus(or spacecraft lol)

Shit, I just reread epic’s post regarding this, and it says that it was due to a small amount of players receiving a backend update. Well hold on now, because usually there is never a “downtime” announced. It’s usually just “oh well fix it when we fix it”. We only ever have typical downtime’s when new updates or hot fixes come out...HMM...

Firstly, the minigun is way too weak. Even after the recent buff in v3.6, I still can't find a use for it beyond destroying enemy structures in squads. The LMG is a very solid weapon, but I think it needs to have a functioning bipod. Also, a major drawback of the LMG is the noise. The gun is so incredibly loud, that I'm afraid to even use since I might end up alerting the entire map to my position.

In using the LMG, you essentially turn a 1v1 fight into a 1v5, since it's almost guaranteed that 4 other players are gonna flock to you during/after the fight. It's a very self-defeating weapon imo. 
I don't know, maybe I'm just making stuff up. I can only speak for myself here, because the moment I hear someone using the LMG, I can immediately pick out where the shots are coming from, and 9/10 times it's a relatively easy kill (since they're already weakened from the gun fight).

As a console player it feels like i can't get any better at building because of the sensitivity on my controller. I am using Builder Pro and i've become so good at building but it's not enough. I want to build faster. I tried to change my sensitivity to 10/10 on X and Y and it works great it's insane how fast you rotate and build when you change it to max sensivity but.. then your aiming becomes shitty. You can't control the aim if you usualy play with 6-7 sens and go to 10. So my suggestion is that Epic adds a feature that when your in building mode you can choose in what speed you can turn, then when you switch to a weapon it's your normal sensitivity again.
This would make console players build better at the same time as they still aim like they did before.

TL;DR - Add a feature to have a separate sensitivity when you're in building mode.

Sorry for my bad eng did my best. I hope you understand!

I know the noobs are happy as hell that people can’t outplay them with FSA  anymore.. but this change literally just makes the game MORE of a sniper and shotgun battle.

    Now, in order to get an accurate shot off with an AR, deagle, revolver, hunting rifle, you have to stand still for a good two seconds (AKA you’re getting sniped in the head). Because of this, people with high ground have an insanely greater advantage and makes it’s a lot harder to outplay them without having to rely on bloom. 

    My suggestion is to half the time if not more when going from crouch to stand. This way you can’t peak instantly and shoot and hide again, but can actually make use of FSA.

We don’t know how big the planet is that this island sits on, but compared to the surroundings it doesn’t look huge. It takes roughly 8 minutes to run across the entire thing, so it can’t be that big. Comets are huge, if one hit the map it wouldn’t just wipe out tilted, it would wipe out the entire island.

The island has been deserted. We don’t know why or for what reason, but maybe the incoming comet has something to do with it. People just packed up and left all their belongings on the island in anticipation of getting wiped out by the comet. They brought their TVs and furnitures and telescopes out with them to confirm the comet’s destructive power, and the future alien takeover that comes shortly after the comet strikes. 

The map is going to be destroyed after this season, and then the new world will be rebuilt by the aliens in the UFO. We’ll see crop circles, pyramids, and even secret labs in the new map. Maybe a giant crater to remember the old map by and some user posted additions to the map that epic has definitely seen but not made any changes to yet. We’ve seen them bring user ideas from this sub to the game before, so they might build a map based on the ideas as well. 

Who knows what’s happening, but that comet won’t destroy only tilted towers if it hits. It’ll take out the whole island. ",FortNiteBR

I am going to gone on a bit of a rant. I know I won't feel better by the end but I have to share my story about how someone got into my account, charged my PayPal and to this day is playing my account as if it is their own.

Last Thursday I was at work when I suddenly saw my phone buzz like crazy. I peaked over and saw multiple emails from Epic and PayPal giving me receipts for V-bucks. I already know about this trend of accounts being hacked and getting charged for save the world. I quickly changed my password, added two-step authentication and submitted a ticket for a refund. Cool!

Come home to check on my computer and health with a power surge that took my computer out of commision (that is another long story I'm not going to go into lol). Great. That's cool. I'll use my PS4 to sign into my account since I heard that is possible with FortNite. Give it a download, login to my account with my new password and.. huh. My skins are all changed. I see that my twitch prime skins are equiped. Maybe that's because it's a new console/device. Whatever. Go to change it back and see that the guy used the V-bucks and bought the pink teddy bear skin, a Valentine's pick axe, a plain black glider and a female character wearing skulls skin. ""Wow this guy has shitty taste"" is what I thought. Whatever, Epic will probably take it away. Changed the skins, played a match and was extremely pissed off my computer was out of commission and I had to use the PS4 controller.

After fixing my computer over the weekend I logged into my email and saw Epic hasn't responded to the ticket. Sent a follow email to let then know I'm still waiting. It IS the weekend so maybe the support was closed. Logged into FortNite on the PC, all the skins are changed again. Weird. It's like the guy touched my account again. Looked at my battle pass and he DEFINITELY was playing it. He earned a few challenges and bumped me into the 90's for tier level. Fuck. Go change my password again.

This is when I learned that Epic has a giant flaw in security. Yes, you can change your accounts password but this DOES NOT log any active sessions out. PS4 was still signed in along with my home PC and even my work computer (when I signed into the website to change my password). I immediately try to grab their attention on Twitter, the ticket a submitted along with a new ticket (I know, that doesn't ever help but I was panicking a bit). I am hearing nothing as of Monday night. 

Whatever, I played a few games and was mostly relieved to be able to win shotgun battles with the wonderful Corsair keyboard and Logitech mouse (best keyboard/mouse combo, fight me if you say otherwise). I went to bed hoping this will all be solved in no time.

Came home yesterday. The boys wanted to play some FortNite. I shivered thinking about this whole situation and thought to myself, whatever, just be optimistic I can play. I logged in and was just disgusted.

THE MF UNLOCKED JOHN WICK. THAT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND MY RIGHT. I PAID FOR THE GOD DAMN BATTLE PASS.. AND HE PUT THE PLAIN BLACK GLIDER ON!

I can't get a response from Epic. I am losing my mind and trying to be patient but home boy is living on my account. My friends say that they will stop talking to me shortly because they have ""New-Garblocks"" to play with. I just wanted to rant and let my voice be heard. Hopefully you got a laugh out of this because that honestly would make me feel better. If anyone wants me to I can update this once I hear back from Epic in 20 years when they get back from buying smoke's and launching a new shitty weapon.

TLDR: account was hacked and I can't sign the guy out. He continues to live on my account and equipment really shitty skins.",FortNiteBR

Ok with the clinger grenade just added we now have 4 different grenades in BR which all have their practical uses.


The regular grenade is just a great early-mid game item before getting a grenade launcher/rpg that can down a base pretty well and can zone players out of a certain area.


The boogie bomb is arguable the weakest of the grenades now (Rest In Peace Smokes) since the nerf but it can be a situational item that can help win a fight with that easy first shot. 


The Impulse grenade is the highest skill cap imo as it has alot of uses. You can use it on yourself to play very aggressive against your enemy or use it on yourself to retreat out of a fight or from the storm. It can also be used on teammates to stop them getting BMed while down. Finally it can be used on your enemies to push them away from you, either off a high ledge or into the storm or just to give you a few seconds to heal up.


We just got the new clinger grenade which I have not had much play time with but I can see this having some good uses in the hands of a good player that knows when/how to use this item.


My issue is with all these good items, you rarely even get to hold one grenade. You're always gonna need an AR. At least one shotgun. Then either a second shotgun/smg or a sniper. With the two slots left you are normally gonna use them on meds. 


My point is I don't want to have to handicap myself to run these items without running the items I need. Yes I can replace my sniper but with the recent FSA nerf, Long Range battles are even harder now. Shotguns dominate the close range so I'm always gonna need at least one. Meds are also needed.


What I would love to see is a grenade slot that can only be used for these 4 items (possible also C4) + your regular 5 slots. Then don't allow these 4 items to be put into our 5 slots and just have this primary grenade slot that they all go into. Yes this means you can no longer run two of the different nades but someone please correct me but I'm pretty sure no one playing seriously would do that.

Just an idea that I think make your loadouts more unique and not just AR/Shotty//Sniper/Minis/Medkit


TLDR; I think they should add a grenade slot that is an extra to your regular 5 that can only be occupied with grenades/clinger grenades/impulse/boogie bomb",FortNiteBR

Also, does anyone actually know why lucky is called ""Lucky Landing""?

There was suddenly all these youtubers making fortnite videos with very similar-looking video thumbnails and titles ""Wow this is the greatest game ever!

Epic Games probably made a lot of money since PUBG used their game engine, and so they were able to put a shit ton of money into marketing, which is why their game practically dominates the internet at the moment.

In a world where tilted doesn't exist, more players would spread out to Retail, Pleasant Park, Salty Springs, Greasy Grove etc. That is what happened before Tilted existed.

Any PoI generally has one, maybe two people emerge victorious and move on through the game. It doesn't matter if 20 go to tilted and 18 die there, or that 20 spreads out to 5~ smaller PoIs and die there. Either way, each PoI gets rid of 90% of the people who land there. I think the nature of this game creates an energetic, fast paced early game which is what creates many of the early deaths before the first circle. I think if players want more of a mid game, more players need to start landing in unmarked places in the map.

If you use Ninja's tournament as an example, you can see how the possibility of winning money pushed created less early high risk deaths. People were landing in safer places, playing safer throughout, and many more players lasted longer in the game. 

I feel like this would also be true if there were a ranked system, but currently you can requeue into a new game in under a minute, so high risk / high reward play has no downside. I am not saying we need a ranked system immediately, especially since it's difficult to implement properly in a BR, but I believe the combination of no system and the nature of the game is what creates the current meta of 30 people remaining for the first circle.

tl;dr: Tilted being deleted wouldn't create a healthier and more populated midgame, a ranked system would. The nature of this game is early face paced shotgun fights with one or two people coming from each PoI. I think the hate on Tilted Towers is a scapegoat for other issues.",FortNiteBR

I enjoy Fortnite, don’t get me wrong. However, this game seems to be sprinting towards the almighty dollar with reckless abandon.

As many of you know, last week Fortnite tweeted a pic saying that the Battle Bus was headed toward China. I and many others got really excited for the potential new map interpretation, others seemed to feel that this was clearly saying that the game was coming to China. I ended up preaching caution and just to see how it played out.

What did happen was a huge swath of posts in this community begging Epic for Fortnite not to ship to China. Not only is the game still in Early Access and developing new bugs with every patch, but there were/are legitimate concerns about cheating, server issues, and a lost focus.

Now, as the above article cites, the tweet was, in fact, an announcement that the game is coming to China. Tencent is putting $15 million into this game to bring it to China and eSports. I don’t know about y’all, but I personally am extremely concerned about the philosophical implications here.

Epic has got on a new cycle of putting out new skins and content weekly. Each successive patch focuses on bug squashing from the previous patch, some fan appeasement, and unwanted new items. They’re making tons of money and about to basically get a blank check for more.

**This game isn’t technically a final release yet!**

The idea to push into China at this stage is essentially the same as adding additions to your house while it’s burning on the other end. Eventually, like Paragon, this games flaws are gonna catch up and the whole house will burn down. That is, unless Fortnite sees some real noticeable changes from the players. Here’s what I’m suggesting we consider if we want to avoid this:

1) Keep upvoting posts that petition Epic to region lock the game or add a server browser that lets you filter out China. 

2) Vote with your wallet. Stop buying skins and BPs. Even if it is only for a week, Epic will want to know why sales dipped.

3) Keep asking for shooting test 2 and all that comes with it.

4) Stop picking up the crap you hate. Leave the C4 and tactical shotguns on the ground. Epic said they already track usage, which is probably why the C4 drop rate got reduced. Maybe Epic will finally adjust the shotgun RNG. There was a popular post here yesterday about how the rifle kinda sucks now in terms of accuracy - I’ve been saying that for a while now about the SCAR - let’s just not pick it up then. 

5) Keep asking Epic when STW is going to be free instead of discounted.

6) Keep asking Epic to STOP adding guns and other crap we don’t need and just focus - even if it is only a week - on squashing bugs and preparing their servers for China.

7) Push for better QA testing on Epic’s side. It seems kinda crazy to keep releasing patches that have obvious problems. It seems like within hours of each patch release, this community finds a major bug.

Again guys and gals, I’m not saying that the player base quits Fortnite for good; I’m just suggesting that we maybe consider if this is the direction we think is right for Epic and consider maybe finding another game to play for ONE WEEK. At the very least, change the meta. Epic isn’t bad, but the dollar signs in their eyes are dangerous for the long term well-being of this game at this point.

TL;DR: This game needs to have more polish before they jump into China and break the game more, and we need to communicate as a community that polish is more important than cosmetics and new content at this point.

Edit: Added a TL;DR. Also, to clarify, revenue is not wrong. It’s the blitz for revenue when there’s still glaring issues with the game. This is the same problem that Netflix and Tesla are having. Their corporate strategy is to basically fill attrition with a more global audience. The problem is that, eventually, you run out of new players to reach while the candle has been burning at the other end.",FortNiteBR

The Michael Jacksons moonwalk needs to be added.","Firstly, I would to say thank you for this wonderful game that you gave us. Fortnite has been killin' it these past few months. The game has brought joy to many people, and it will keep on doing so for years to come. I love that the game is free to play and that we can buy in-game skins and emotes which, by the way, are amazing. The new dances are amazing and fun especially when the boys and I dance in the disco rooms.

Now then, on to the real reason for this post... EPIC, Baby, Where that Michael Jackson (MJ) dance emote at tho????? The disco room has opened my eyes to the fact that we NEED an MJ dance emote. Imagine it, Picture it, ENVISION IT! Winning a game and then hitting that sweet MJ leg flick, then doing a 360 spin followed by that MJ tiptoe and crotch grab. Finally, you destroy your opponent with that sweet moonwalk. MAH DUDES, PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT RAIN WITH V-BUCKS when that dance comes out. Nevermind tilted towers, EVERYONE will be dropping at the dancefloors. Your servers wont be able to handle the moonwalks that are going to happen.

Thank you for reading this and may the rest of you be blessed.

Edit: Moonwalk first, then comes the 360 spin with tiptoe.

- If the circle is even remotely close to the starting path of one of the buses almost everyone from that team will go there. The other team will most likely scatter all over the map.
- The team that reaches the circle first practically gets every supply drop.
- The team that’s in the circle doesn’t have to worry about the storm.
- Meanwhile, the other team, with their crappy weapons that they scavenged along the way, has to not only reach the circle but also deal with getting picked off one by one as they get closer.

2) Teamwork doesn’t exist.

- Everyone’s competing so hard to get stuff that they’ll literally impulse a teammate off a cliff for a pistol.
- Think that guy’s gonna revive you? Forget it.
- On the opposite side of the map and trying to build a ramp for your team to jump pad off? Nope, there’s gonna be one guy who wants to break it so you all fall to your death or die in the storm.

P.S. Yes, there are some games I’ve played that have been amazing and most of the people are good sports but ultimately it’s disappointing. Epic should have known these things would happen.

EDIT: I fully respect anyone who disagrees with anything I say. These are my opinions, they aren’t facts, I’m simply one person. And I’m completely open to other opinions as well. I’m genuinely interested in discussion over who won this debate.

I have 200 V-Bucks at the moment, anyways, I will buy the battle pass next season, but thinking about it a little bit, if I buy the one from this season I would get +500 V-Bucks at this moment. Can you predict that next season's battle pass will also be 950 V-Bucks again? That way I could grind 300 V-Bucks for 5 days and buy the next one while still being able to get the rewards from season 3.

Am I thinking it wrong? What should I do?

They have their place in leveling structures to get clear line of sight.

However, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been killed by a team that has rushed me, is three feet away from me and blown me up with an RPG, because friendly fire doesn’t exist in this game. At least when I’m engaged in shotgun combat, I have some resemblance of control of the situation, but with this new strategy I don’t have a chance to even shoot the enemy team back before being killed or downed.

I understand, it’s a way to play the game, and that it’s a viable strategy. I just feel like it’s a pretty huge advantage for someone with an RPG, over someone who doesn’t.

It should be better, not worse.

Don't get me wrong, I get that the Heavy Shotgun does have it's strengths. It's the most consistent shotgun in the game and has good range. But what's the point if the other shotguns still stomp it in overall kill potential? You're still gonna get 1-pumped or outsprayed by the tac. The fire rate should be in-line with the tac making it a direct upgrade. Just like the M16 is white/green/blue and the SCAR is purple/gold. Having the tac fire rate wouldn't even make it OP tbh.

Here's why.,"10 ticking your health while your down makes your revive nearly impossible and promotes your teammates not engage people close\-by otherwise you'll just melt into the map. If he makes it to you without 20 people shooting at you and attempts to throw up walls before getting your revive you'll also be SOL unless he was standing right on top of you to begin with. 

You think you're jump padding anywhere? Forget about it. Your teammates just blew out your ramp and now you're on the ground with broken legs. Even if your teammate wanted to save you he can't because he's only got 10 seconds to get to you. Another big thumb down for 10 tick health bar.

You're in an epic build battle with 3 people trying to get the high ground on you? No you're not.. Cause Timmy from Jersey has no idea you're his teammate and shot your materials out from under you. In a crippled stance you wait patiently as 10 seconds passes before you die. Your teammates were close\-by but so were the other 3 guys you were build battling with and they're glad your teammate doesn't have time to engage them then revive you. 10 tick health bar takes another critical hit.

I appreciate that boogie bomb you threw at me Caleb. It got my killed and I would have laughed but the game prior a guy who I can only presume must be related to you or of similar IQ level impulsed me out of a port a fort. Unfortunately the distance I gained as I flew to my demise was also just a couple seconds shy of my teammate saving me. Well played 10 tick.. well played.

TLDR: Teammates shouldn't be able to shoot their teammates ramps or materials, shouldn't be able to impulse and boogie bomb you and 10 seconds isn't enough time in the knocked state. Next time 50v50 comes around let's do it right?! So there's at least a little fun to be had?",FortNiteBR

Once the timer is done, You have a choose of either passing on the skin, losing the 100 Vbucks and it being normal price if you decide later you want to buy it, but saving the other 1100, 1400, and 1900 if you really didn't want it, Or you can purchase it, and the fee for renting it will be added into the price, so the skin then only costs 1900 Vbucks, plus the 100 you already spent to rent it, totaling 2000 vbucks.

I propose that you shouldn't be able to build a wall again in the same spot until the time to complete the building of the wall has elapsed or some variation of this timer.

This would also allow for the ability to ""push"" people back from their position. If they can't rebuild the wall in the same spot it requires them to retreat backwards or move sideways to build a wall in a new ""tile"" of the map. This would allow for pushing people out of the zone, as well as forcing some type of movement or for the player to have to gun battle you eventually.

I personally just think it is ridiculous that with even 4 people shooting at a single wall that the player behind it should be able to spam build just to survive, especially late in the game where you will run out of ammo before the player will run out of materials. This building method now seems to make the game cater to super defensive players, until they see an opportunity to do something like open a window in their wall to get the one-tap shotty kill.

Edit: The controlled launcher was good at countering this, and before you try to say just hold onto impulses to jump towards and attack him, in a winning position for my team or even in solos I shouldn't be forced to run at a player to get a kill if they play super defensive, this only allows them to build a quick staircase to get the height advantage as soon as I move.",FortNiteBR

After the addition of build-pro I was really excited. I thought awesome, now I can build as fast as ninja does on console, and I was right.

Everywhere I go now on PS4, there are massive towers, randomly built everywhere. But I'm not certain it is a good change when combined with turbo build on console.

The issue I see coming is that very quickly in the past two weeks the ramp and shotgun rush has exploded on console. All of a sudden excellent builders under the old system have been qualised by Epic with them saying to bad builders 'hey no stress, you cant build well, just hold down ramp and run at your opponent'.

Where formerly you were rewarded for being able to build well, gain height and snipe, rocket or AR from above, now it just seems everyone is the ramp rush mode and it feels very quickly like a totally different game.

It unfortunately forces players to run a very specific loadout in game and from what I am seeing in the last say 5 players, it all of a sudden seems a big base camp off until somebody decides they have the rush advantage and takes it.

I've played my fair share of games, 1,000 solos, 100 wins there and more in squads. All of a sudden the game feels really different, and the rapid build everywhere to me seems like it'll have a detrimental impact of mid to lower range current players, as well as new ones wanting to get involved.

Keen to hear what others think. I'm certain many will downvote me who love turbo build and build pro, I think having one of those two is the right balance on console, having both becomes a who can spam the most with no need for accuracy or good building, just spam everywhere.

Cheers guys!",FortNiteBR

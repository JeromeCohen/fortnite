10,Kane447,1519759757,80pale,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/80pale/adding_tilted_towers_was_a_big_mistake/,0,Adding Tilted Towers was a big mistake.,"Whenever you drop at a location far from Tilted you will have 5-10 minutes of action (if enemies drop there at all) but after that you will have half an hour of running through empty landscapes. You will meet enemies only very rarely, unless you come close to Tilted or arrive at the small circles near the end of the game. The number of people alive drop to 15-25 within the first 10 to 15 minutes of the game which is way too fast imo. This results in huge circles with very few players... and action.

Don't get me wrong. I like the location as such. But since Titled was added almost every mid-game has become a boring running simulator with little to no action. Not to mention that many locations are often totally empty in the beginning of the game, which is a pity and was different before the major update. 

This is because Tilted is the best place by far in terms of available loot and the central location on the map. Before Tilted was added the map was empty in the middle, except for Dusty Depot and perhaps Salty plus Lame Lake. This led to a great balance of people dropping everywhere and a better mid game since more people survived early game. Perhaps this is not only because of Tilted, but too many locations in general. The more locations you add or have the less people will drop at your place on average... quick math.

The solution? Obviously removing Tilted is no option, unless a huge number of people demand it which is unlikely. One option would be to make Tilted smaller or remove some of the loot. But this option will be unpopular aswell. The third option would be to move Tilted to another place, like the area around Wailing woods for instance where ever since the update almost no one drops. But people won't like this either. Maybe increase the number of players from 100 to 150? Unrealistic.

So I guess in the end nothing will be done to adress this problem since all solutions would be unpopular, despite the possibilty of improving the mid-game and overall gameplay experience significantly. So all we can hope for is that Epic learns from this and if they create another map, which is very likely, they will hopefully not make the same mistake again. Afterall the game is still amazing, despite Tilted Clusterfu*k Towers.

Tl;dr: Tilted Towers ruined mid-game but all(?) solutions suck. Hopefully Epic realizes this and won't do the same mistake twice; when creating a new second map for example.",FortNiteBR

To be fair, I have only started focusing on this the past year (in regards to gaming) and it has done wonders for my body. As a personal trainer and somewhat older gamer, I have noticed the importance of taking care of your body while gaming in order to prevent different problems from arising while putting in long hours.

Focusing on proper posture, mobility, and myofascial release techniques can really work wonders. I think it's extremely important for younger gamers to focus on this kind of stuff to prevent problems as they age.

This tweak has altered how the pump reloads each shot; requiring the full pump animation to complete before you can fire again similar to the bolt sniper.

Now initially this solution sounded ideal, and I advocated for it along with many others.

However, this nerf has hurt the pump in an unanticipated way; your realistic rate of fire with the pump is not consistent because anything you do (open a door, build etc.) interrupts the animation.

What often happens is that you'll fire one shot and be forced to build defensively as you are rushed by a Tac or SMG. The opportunities for you to equip and complete the pump animation are few and far between.

As such the pump is now the least flexible CQC weapon assuming you don't one-shot every enemy. In fact, the pump only fits into the meta now if you use it to combo with a Tac or an SMG which ironically us back to square one in a sense.

What I propose, if possible, is that the pump animation be effectively turned into a *cooldown* rather than a restrictive *animation*. This would still prevent double pumping by guaranteeing a max rate of fire while at the same time not punishing you for engaging in the core gameplay of building while your pump is ""holstered"".

My idea for a vehicle would be to have a golf cart! Don't know if anyone has mentioned it before but I feel as if a golf cart would perfectly fit into the stylings of fortnite without going so PUBG with cars and motorcycles. 

Golf carts would only move at speeds 1.5-2x the sprint speed as to not be completely gamebreaking. A whole squad would be able to fit into one golf cart, one driving (unable to shoot), one passenger (only able to shoot in the front half of the way the cart is facing and is able to build ramps to get over mountains etc.), and two on the back (only able to shoot in the back half of the cart).

The bush shouldn’t be a legendary loot drop anymore.

Make it a trap, stackable in your trap/launch pad inventory and just have it found on the ground like the spike trap. It’s a waste of good loot in chests and supply drops to find a bush. Remove it as a wearable/consumable and instead make it drop on the ground so it’s a temporary disguise. Don’t have anywhere to hide?

If ""win a match"" is a weekly thing - and you don't - be on top of the other ones.

If you didn't have S2 - you're working with 1150 Max Stars - if you miss one hard challenge, and complete everything else, you will have to make level 81 to complete it (without paying vbucks).  If you make Lvl 100 (which is far from certain), you can miss EITHER 1 Daily or Easy per week.

[suggestion],"Currently every pump in your inventory has it's own ""Cooldown"". After each shot you will have to 'pump' the shotgun. But the problem with this is that it feels extremely clunky when using the pump.  
 
Right now if you shoot your pump then build then swap back again to shoot you still have to wait for the 'pump' cooldown. This gives a very clunky and awkward feeling. You get moments where you swap to your gun and it just doesn't shoot, because you forgot that you had to pump it. Fortnite is really fast paced and that is why clunky/awkward moments like that just don't feel like they should be in the game. 
 
A fix to this problem could be giving the pump a ""Global Cooldown"". So instead of making it so that every single pump shotgun in your has its own cooldown it would now be shared globally. If you shoot with 1 pump you will have to wait X amount of time to shoot again, doesn't matter if you switch to a different pump or not. This way people are still able to use the single pump without having to encounter these clunky/awkward moments where the gun doesn't shoot and the double pump would still be nerfed (as the pumps would share a global cooldown so it doesn't matter if you switch between them. 

The global cooldown can also be used for other weapons in the future that might get the same nerf as the pump got. 

**TL;DR**: Give the pump shotgun a global cooldown, so you can't quick swap between pumps. But when you swap after shooting to another gun and swap back you'll be free to use your original pump again without having to wait for it's delay between shots.

I get P1....P2. Stop.

I'll preface by saying that i'm a good player who has an average of 1 win to 5 game ratio and I play on PS4.

I have 613 games played solo and currently have 127 wins.

I made a new account to mess around with on fortnite but i've played 13 so far and not lost any.

The players don't build anything when I shoot them and they jump in circles even if i'm right up close.

I've seen players crouch-walk in the open as if it's normal.

I've also not even been tested by anyone; I see someone, I shoot, then build above then they die; they just stand there.

compare this to my 'main account', nobody does this; it's the complete opposite.

I worded the title that way because a bot deletes it and asked me to post it to the 16 day old skill thread. 

Try it yourselves, make a new account because i'm sure they added it.

I've seen streamers/YouTubers and other players alike willingly use a grey pump over a purple tactical. And I'm all for a high risk high reward weapon. But a grey pump - something you can find willy nilly anywhere on the map shouldn't be able to one shot people in an instant. It's some of the most rage inducing, unfitting meta in this game. A green pump doing 100+ damage? Fine. I'll treat finding a green pump as rare as a purple tactical or a scar. I feel fucking blessed to have it and I treat it as such. But why use the green when the grey is literally just as good? I believe if I'm getting one shot in the head it better be from someone shitting on me with a hand cannon, magnum, or a sniper. They earned that kill because they were accurate. But you're telling me someone who finds a grey pump just lying around deserves to one shot me because they happen to barrel stuff me after sitting around a corner thirding me? It is so rage inducing. If the grey pump did 80 MAX and the green could max 150 I'd feel great. At least vs a grey I can fight for my life instead of blinking and I'm back in the lobby. 

EDIT: And before you down vote me to hell why don't you leave some actual constructive criticism. Don't comment that I'm bad, etc. Tell me how I can counter being one shot every game. Or tell me how I can survive longer after losing full shield and 70HP to a lucky body shot. Help me improve myself instead of just assuming I'm some bad kid.

Sadly, this game hasn't worked correctly since they've redone the map. Since that day, the 'invisible gun' glitch has came, and is still around. We've got issues, such as, shooting people...getting a hit marker...and then getting knocked w/o your shot doing any damage. This happens way too often. We've got silent footsteps/bullets. We've got people shooting at us before they even have a gun in their hand. We've got people being able to pull their gun out before you can pulls yours out. There's a crashing bug now.

All these, AND more that I can't think of right now have been here for a while with no fix. Yes, in every patch they SAY they fix these issues but they're not fixed.

While we have these issues, with no fix..we get nice skins, and new items to the game. I would like for one week they focus on just bugs and truly figure out ways to better the game and stabilize it.

The majority of gun fights end the same way, at some point someone decides to just push with ramps and shotgun the oponent leading to a space bar bashing shotgun spamming duel.
This is making the game EXTREMELY boring, they are obviously overpowered compared with all other weapon types at close/ medium range fights you have a giant square to aim with and u dont have to deal with the rng of bloom and you one shot players with it.
The only people i see in forums who claim shotguns / doble pumps arent overpowered are the ones who cant play without them.
The exact same thing happen to mercy in overwatch, overused, easy to play, huge game changer. and hwne it finaly got nerfed the players that only used her basicly just quit the game all together because they cant handle when ther bread and butter gets removed.

**The Regular Everyday Normal Gamer**: These guys are the regular gamers that will play some Fortnite when coming home after work with their friends.

They will drop sometimes at busy places like Pleasant Park or Retail Row, but never at Tilted Towers as they're tired to get fu**ed. They will share loot, help each other, communicate every single route and every single loot they have at the moment. When they get attacked, it's a fanfest of girly shouts and bad decisions. When someone gets DBNO, they will loot first before reviving their friend.

Weapons: Blue Rifles, Purple Tac, Sniper/Rocket, Medkits and Shields. Skins: PSN Plus skin, Blue Knight, First Astronaut  
  
**The Stealthy Lonely Wolf**: These guys usually play solo matches, and are known to drop at places no one else will drop. Will loot gracefully, walk in the shadows, hide in bushes and below staircases, moving forward silently and slowly. They will use the storm on their favour, watching people fight and die one by one without exposing themselves. They'll calmly kill you through a bush and you won't even know.

**The Lucky Motherfu&amp;%er**: He doesn't have 20 hours in the game yet. He uses the default rangers skin. He drops at Tomato Town. He mine wood by breaking house's walls. He clearly don't know what he is doing. He almost died for the storm three times.  He used the Jump pad in the ground. He took his shield before the mini shields. He used his Chug Jug with 100% Health.  He won because the circle closed on him and he killed you by throwing a boogie bomb on you and finishing with a green Tac.

When do we say enough with these prices?

But lets be serious here, $20 for a Skin? $20 for a Parachute?
Soon enough we'll see $20 Harvesting tools.

But this is where it wont stop, EVERYTHING will be for sale. 

here's my list of everything that will be for sale in the future.

1.) Decorative Walls

2.) Tricks that you can do in the sky when you fall out of the bus.

3.) Skins you can add to your guns when you pick them up

4.) Possibly even Auras (why not?)

But come on they've already implemented backpacks which means soon enough they will increase the size of the item store because there wont be enough things to purchase.

These prices need to come way down at no point in time should skins be worth consecutively $20.

We had Valentines day and Chinese new year and they brought out epic skins back to back.

I buy skins but i'm really starting to feel like im being milked.

Why do v-bucks go from $10 -&gt; $25 -&gt; $60 -&gt; $100? 

Of course cosmetics dont equate to skill but sheesh.

Let’s start by talking about levels. If you reach level 100 by the end of the season you’ll get a total of 31 tiers or 310 stars. Remember the tiers for later. For the math you’ll get 31 because there are 80 levels that give you two stars each (16 tiers),10 That give 5 stars each (5 tiers) and 10 That give a Tier each(10 tiers). All this adds up to 31 tiers you can earn just from leveling up.

Now let’s go to the weekly challenges. Assuming that we get one set of weekly challenges that give a total of 50 stars each week(besides week 9,which gives 40 stars)for 9 weeks you’ll get 440 stars or 44 tiers. Now add the quests for non battle pass owners(which I believe are a one time thing) and you get 50 stars or 5 extra tiers. All these tiers add up to 49 tiers which added with our tier amount from leveling up gives us a total of 80 tiers.
(Note: If the rewards for getting 4/7 of your weekly challenges is met is not 4000 XP in the future and instead is Battle Pass stars then this will mess up the math a little bit).

One more thing. If you had last seasons battle pass then you got 5 free tiers which with the current 80 tiers we have if you make it to level 100 and do all weekly challenges will give you a grand total of 85 tiers that can be done if you do all things required for you to do.

“Only 85 tiers?” You ask “So EPIC is forcing me to buy tiers to get John Wick?!”

No they’re not,I forgot one variable that can get you to That beloved tier 100.

Daily Challenges.

You get one challenge a day that rewards 5 stars each which means you have to do 30 dailies or 15 tiers to get to level 100.

End Results( TL;DR)
To get the Battle Pass you will need to...
Reach Level 100(31 Tiers)
Do all Battle Pass Weeklies(44 tiers)
Do the one free weekly(5 tiers)
5 tier bonus from last season(5 tiers)
And do atleast 30 daily challenges(15 tiers)

And all this will add up to 100 Tiers.

Please note any typos and such in the comments and let me know if this helped you at all. Thanks

The survey ended as expected, with many people having negative feelings towards SBMM. There will be future surveys.

If you don't care for a wall of text, please leave now! I felt this post was unavoidable to keep short. Sorry not sorry.

# An Apology

Hello everyone! I would like to start off by saying sorry for the delay of results. The previous two weeks were extremely busy and consumed most of my time. I appreciate all of you that have been messaging me to remind me to get this stuff done.

Furthermore, I would like to apologize to all the people that applied to my previous recruitment post and have not heard back. Rest assured, I have made my picks. (Spoiler: You can see them further down)

# Survey Results

You can view the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7wov78/rfortnitebr_unofficial_community_survey/)

##  Brief Summary
I am sure everyone had a general idea of what to expect from the survey, and this definitely did solidify what most people already believed. **Most people really do not like the idea of any Skill Based Matchmaking (SBMM) implementation.** Rest assured, Epic Games has heard your fears and I have been told they would never consider such a feature without first **strongly** considering the myriad of variables it takes to get it right.

## Noteworthy Results
* Even after reiterating it many times, many people still believe I work for Epic Games and that the survey was somehow Epic related. Regardless, I enjoyed reading how much you think Epic is ruining the game with their ""bullshit updates and emotes"".

* One thing I noticed coming up in discussion a lot is the type of player the average Redditor represents. Most people were under the belief that the average Reddit user was not casual, but in fact **there is an almost 50/50 split between players that consider themselves to be a casual and competitive player**.

* In terms of the actual implementation of SBMM, there was definitely a common theme. Of those that believed it could work, the most common (and basic) answer was for it to exist as a separate mode. I personally believe that if any sort of ranked mode were to be implemented, that is how it would be. 

* Surprisingly, **15% of you think that a SBMM implementation should not be a separate mode**! This (rather high in my opinion) percentage may be due to misinterpreting what the question was asking, but otherwise would mean that the community is wrong in how much everyone hates the idea.

* Overwatch, Counter Strike, and the token (ticket) system. Many respondents who felt like being more passionate tended towards a couple categories. Overwatch and CS:GO were common games cited as doing matchmaking well. A token/ticket system was also a common suggestion that seems to have a lot of favor among the subreddit.

* Another thing to note, you guys play *a lot* of Fortnite. Of the 15,028 people that answered, I'd estimate you all play in the high tens of thousands of hours a week. (Many of you answered 15+ hours, if all of you just played one that would still be 15k hours a week!).

I'll leave the interpretation of everything else up to you guys. But as an added bonus, I've generated

## Raw Data
As promised, everyone now has full access to the survey data. [You can view the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLh-vSryjBlzt8i1OVBbGrCRe3MdgS8WPwOhmAMOCDo/edit?usp=sharing). If you find anything interesting feel free to make note of it in the comments below (I tried to go through all **15,028 responses** but it is quite a daunting task).

[You can view some more fancy stats here.](https://awesome-table.com/-L50zGDk6AVWr1k_jmBa/view)

## Future Surveys
I think we'll definitely be doing future surveys on what we consider to be topics of the week, as well as monthly ""check ups"" on where people believe the game is at. As a result, if you think there are any pressing questions that deserve data, shoot me a message.

Future surveys will be more planned out and last a week (until the next survey is posted). Upon closing, all data and a summary will be released.

# Recruitment Picks

## Programmer(s)
Please welcome your new code slaves /u/DaJuukes and /u/bcb67. They will be assisting my takeover of the world. We will begin by making a bot that doesn't break, doesn't have ugly code, and does my taxes. Perhaps also a Discord bot for everyone as well (mainly going be for us mods though).

Here's a little something about each of them:

* /u/DaJuukes Hi! I'm a Node.js specialist and work in Discord and Reddit bots, along with Ethereum stuff. You can find more info about me here: http://dajuukes.codes

* /u/bcb67 Hey Reddit squad! Just wanted to introduce myself, I'm /u/bcb67 and I'm going to be joining the /r/fortnitebr team to hopefully write some cool moderation tools / bots. I'm 21 years old and am a Senior at NC State University in Raleigh NC. I actually work as a part time Information Security Analyst @ Epic.

## CSS/Designer(s)
Please welcome your new fashion designers /u/scorpionmechanic , /u/Ullaakut, and /u/Mastergoat. Two of which I've seen some brief initiative taken to help out, but I look forward to new ideas and new eyesores for everyone to look at! Being serious, I hope to tackle some long wanted features such as night mode, a proper filter, and a fancy sidebar.

Here's a little something about each of them:

* /u/Ullaakut I'm a French software engineer working in Luxembourg (just fresh fired one week ago, my whole project team along with a few others have been trashed). I'm 99% backend but I still have some old skills in design and frontend so it should be fine for the job here. I'm 23, I like making video games on the Unreal Engine, playing tennis, and working on open source projects!

* /u/Mastergoat Hey I'm MasterGoat (damn I wish I made a new account before this!) I'm a 20 year old FortNiteBR Addict from Darwin, Australia. My days consist of working for the government for 8 hours then another 8 hours of trying to get those Victory Royales! I've been creating my own video games and websites for a few years now and am happy I can finally apply that experience properly to a community that has been a big part of my life the past 6 months. Look forward to help make this site snazzy and pretty for you all!

* /u/ScorpionMechanic Ok, my name is u/ScorpionMechanic, I just joined the FortniteBR Mod Team as a CSS Designer. IDK if my age will be a problem, but, I recently turned eighteen. I've been doing Graphic Design for almost ten years, mostly doing personal works or commissions from friends of my parents. I'm the designer of the FortniteBR subreddit.

Part of it I feel is that I can't get the perfect balance for me with the sensitivity, and generally I'm not great at shooters.

In fortnite I can't land an effective shotgun hit to save my life. Literally. I can have the whole reticle box on the man, torso and head but I generally get 9 damage on my hits unless I have height on an unsuspecting opponent. Meanwhile with smgs or pistols I'm much better at killing people. Pistols have good DPS so they're understandable but people generally leave smgs, which helps me when there's a blue or purple lying around.

I know there are personal preferences in this game, but people generally say shotguns in close range over the smgs. Not sure if that's changed with the new patch.

Everyone (in a duo or squad) has been a victim of been a victim of being finished immediately without hesitation and as i would think as well, you are one of those people or that you are guilty of those actions, whether it is because they are having a bad day, being beaten in their childhood or are just pointlessly being an asshole. It can also be that you are thinking ""hey, this asshole would've killed me if he would've knocked me down, why shouldn't i just kill him"". I thought that once to myself and to be honest it kinda feels good letting out that rage built in after all the ""mental toxins"" in your body. But i recently decided to not finish people of after knocking them down and maybe they would respect that. But as it is there's a fowl in this game to not be able to talk to your opponents and they wouldn't maybe know if i was showing courtesy or they are just being assholes. Look, it's fine if you are finishing a guy because his teammates are insecure of fighting other people, but if your'e rushing to them in a hurry to finish them before you die of just to ruin his and his teammates gaming experience because you aren't good enough in this game so you need a 1 kill at least per game so you can recover your shitty k/d ratio, then you're just another toxic scum in this unwashed shit community. I want to solve this problem and i think i have a veeeery simple solution that everyone can do. Just don't be a cunt and don't finish people off in an asshole way. And so the other people see that you are respecting his and his friends gaming experience, throw up a lovely cute sticker, do a heart emote or crouch three times. I don't know how many people will see this so this may not have any impact on this community, but i know i'm not the only one in this community with this frustration.

I'll never be sure why they decided to implement auto building on both platforms. 

Before the update there was a balance of building and gun play that worked fine and was fair, but since the update its extremely off balance. The second someone hears a gun shot now without even looking they immediately build a 1:1 scale of trump tower, sitting out of site with shotgun in hand, sweat flowing down their brow as they clench their razor deathadder to the point of near combustion.

My issue is, the gun fights have taken a hit since the update. If you're playing solos, you take one shot  and if its not an instant kill, they hold down left click and spin around as fast as they can, or they literally just sit there holding left click in your direction, building a wall faster than you can destroy it with a golden scar. If I'm swapping between 2 golden scars, they can build that wall over and and over before one bullet can hit them. So unless you have a launcher you're forced to engage in RNG shotgun combat to the death, because they refuse to move. Shotguns are pretty RNG, and I think that's something everyone can agree on. I'm really happy double pump was fixed, but this update just fills in that empty void, as before you were forced into shotgun fights as everyone rushed with double pump, but now you're forced into similar situations because of build spamming and people not moving.

Taking the time to click on pc wasn't hard, and there is no need for auto building on this platform. They should have sent out 2 different patches for each.

Before the update, building was a skill, it was something that took time and effort to master and be good at, but with auto-building people just spam build trying to replicate the players who use building effectively. A player like Ninja builds in a way where he has balance between building and gun play, but some players might see that and just think he wins due to spamming staircases and walls. They based this update around the building and gameplay style of streamers and pro players, maybe in an attempt for newer players to be on equal ground to experienced players, but imo it does the opposite. If a new player had to deal with EVERY person they came across building frantically with no direction, I don't think it would be very inviting.

I also think this update may have also been a quick fix to building issues (building staircases above instead of infront). 
I don't think this update will ever be changed or removed, but I'm curious if anyone out there feels the same way.

TLDR: I don't hate building, it's a necessary part of what makes the game fun to begin with. I think auto-building is good for console, NOT for pc.",FortNiteBR

There was a reddit post not so long ago that some dude wanted a god damn melee weapon that could reflect bullets and backstab enemies for a lot of dmg (if you are sneaky), are you gonna add that aswell? Might aswell create a skin for it and call it Genji.

Just please stop adding new things and just fix your current bugs and servers and let it be for a while. 
League of legends did the same misstake by having a new Champion coming out every month and that ruined the competitive scene because everything was either too OP/Broken or fucking useless and had to be fixed asap.

I'm not saying that you are like Riot Games, in fact you are waaaay better than them but if this shit keeps on going you are gonna make the game less competitive and all the so ""incoming"" tournaments are gonna fail.

The flood of these complaints and posts is primarily by people who can't afford it or don't see the value at that price point.  People seem to complain because they want it to be priced at something they can afford or something they deem appropriate value.  You can post all you want, but there is a market for $20 skins.  There is likely a market for even more expensive skins as well.  Part of the value in paying for more expensive skins is that you know less people will buy it, providing for a larger exclusivity factor.

It would be cool to have something to grind for even after battle pass tiers finish. But at the moment i have a lot of people with 250+ wins who lose interest until the next season once they get the final tier of battle pass.

It would be super cool to have something to continually grind for. Something like every 100 wins you get a sick new glider.

**Some ideas could be:**

100 - Almost like birthday balloons that have 3 strings 1 0 0. From there maybe the 200 and 300 could be a little more intricate or have some kind of sparklers around it.

I know this is definently not high priority and i feel like I'll definently get some hate for complaining, but i feel lots of 3 digit win players are very attached to the game, and spend a lot of money. Incentivizing a long term grind, no matter how many wins, will keep people playing all season and reduce some burn out or lack of motivation during late mid-end of seasons.

Edit: hell even think  25 or 50 wins, or even 10 would be good too, because not just big winners should get a cool milestone.

6. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to by cosmetics 

 7. If your character has a new skin all of the sudden then it swaps back to the old that skin is probably a STW skin. If some bald guy with headphones comes up on your screen he’s a STW hero

I feel like since the current patch I'm having to spend a lot more time farming resources.

This is a building game, and as people are building more and more during fights. At times, it can be tough to maintain resources after playing aggressive and building during multiple fights. 

I can easily blow through 200-400 resources in a fight and my opponent is likely doing the same, so whoever wins might not get many resources. Basically, I'd like to spend a little less time farming and more time in battle. 

I think an uptick of even just 5-10% resources per hit with your pick axe would be ideal.

Has anyone seen a sharp increase of difficulty from their opponents since 3.0 (and potentially earlier)?

I miss dying to the bush. To the guy who sits and waits in a building. To the player who lands the shot of his life and then doesn't understand basic gameplay while you spectate him.

Every single game now when I play the game per usual - if I shoot at someone, they will spin, build, and rush aggressively. Their teammate will set up the perfect flank. They hit all their shots. It's fun, but it's a total sweat fest out there for me and my buddies now. And it's ruining the fun, more relaxing and fun experience the game has always had.

I'm on the Xbox, and my buddy and I had a 40% win rate in the duos playlist prior to 3.0. We're sitting around 10% now, and it has nothing to do with changes we've made on our end. We land in the same locations we used to, we communicate the same and play as a team just the same.

The player base has gotten better, no doubt, but I have a hard time believing it's at this rate.

Now, Epic has done an amazing job communicating with us, better than I've ever seen before from a gaming company. But I just have a feeling my recent gameplay experience in Fortnite is the result of something they truly wanted to implement, and that they didn't disclose implementing it because of the potential outrage.

One of the biggest defenses for skill based changes in Fortnite was that you wouldn't even notice it. I can assure you, that's not the case, and a few hours of streaming the game makes that very apparent.

I've logged over 60 games with a win. I love the start of each match. The prospect of victory is a rush with each drop. 

Regardless of the positives, I absolutely loathe the randomness of character assignment. It's baffling to me that a game inspired by individual gameplay style, uniques, and character skins can so arbitrarily make the avatar selection obsolete. Why? Why create unlockables if I can't even choose the character that wears the rewards?

Not to mention, I don't want to play as some hunky dude. It's bland, it's boring, and cliche for video games to embrace the 'Rambo\-styled' protagonist. This isn't about body positivity or anything, it's about little variety. I'm so sick of playing as 'the hulk,' that I'll sometimes restart because I'd rather play as the Lara Croft look\-alike.

I know these types of posts are numerous, but I will pay up to $10 to have a permanent character if it means BR stays free. I don't even care if the avatars are inspired \- it doesn't need to be an RPG \(please don't\), and the characters don't need kitschy personalities. It can be as simple as choosing skins.

Regardless, give me something. Even in the interim. Even if something better in customization is coming, just give me something in the meantime. I'll buy it. I'll be happy with anything as long as the character can be consistent and that I have some role in choosing. I want to be with the same avatar/skin throughout all my successes and failures. It will feel like we've been through countless battles together, and give the game a little more intimacy.

Not too bad for giving it away for """"""free""""""

 Second of all it freaking better be free: this game is buggier than a tropical rain forest at night and guess who is putting all the time and resources into finding all of these and painstakingly pleading with the devs to fix it? We are. So yeah, it better be free, cause if I had paid money for this I would've felt like  I got robbed. Like I walked out of the Gucci store with a Chinese knock off. Lost count of how many times last night I landed, picked up a gun, and ran around with empty hands until I got shot because I wasn't able to take out anything, not even the axe. protip: being able to take out your gun is pretty important in a fps. The night ended with me fully looted, based up on the high ground, looking down at 2 take out 3 as I'm finna clutch this solo then guess what happens - my tv screen blacks out and I'm back at the xbox home screen. Literally have never had that happen with any other game and I fllipped out and threw my controller across the room. I haven't picked it up since but that's probably broken now so that's even more money this game is making me spend.

The scaling damage would help it last through till near end game, and would be incredibly viable for smoking out those pesky base campers (no insult towards those players) 

The damage would start at 1 tick of health (damages health through shields, just like the storm) and scale to 2 with the second circle, then to 3 with the third, capping out at 3 damage a second.

Please tell me what you think and be harsh :p, I know it will seem complicated but it's actually very simple and I tried my best to explain it.

Here is what I know of Fortnite so far (and that I tried to take into account while making my system):

	- In a straight 1v1 the better player will reliably win.

	- Positioning, scooting and building are a key factor in determining if you’re good or not, if you get 
         sniped from the side and die you probably were miss positioned.

	- Even the best player in the game will die if he is in an unfavorable situation, and those situation are 
        very common at the start of the game (having no weapon, falling in a 1v3 etc.) but there are ways 
        of avoiding them as you get more in game experience.

	- Fighting someone on even ground is pretty uncommon, picking your battles is part of what makes 
        you better.

	- Sneaking around and hiding in bushes are a way of playing the game and should not be punished by 
        the system

	- Few weapons in the game give such an advantage that getting them is unfair to others (Mainly the 
        rocket launcher), since the game is mostly revolved around people having 150 health (shield being 
        very common and all) all AR take 5 bullets (body shots) to kill you (even the golden scar) 

So it’s the same as the ELO system but a bit more complicated, there would be a **separate** game mode called something like Ranked.When the system is implemented, everybody starts with a **score** of let’s say 1500 points and depending on how you play you’ll earn or loose points each game. So far all standard.


When a lobby is made, your score is **locked** and can’t change until the game ends, let’s say it’s a solo, the arithmetic mean of all the players' score (let’s call it **SAM start** score arithmetic mean at the start) determines the level at which you have to perform and will be showed below the mini map. This SAM will evolve as the game go on and people die, showing you a representation of the level of the players left in the game. 
Both the SAM at the start of the game (**SAM start**) and at the point at which you die or win (**SAM end**) should be taken into account because if all the good players die at the start of the game you are more likely to survive longer.


So the formula is this:


((SAMstart\*Number of people in the lobby at start)/(Your score\*2)-(Position at which you end))/(SAMstart/SAMend)


+50 in case of a Victory Royal


Rounded up


For example if your score is 1500 and there are 98 people in the lobby the SAM start is 1600 so an average of better players than you in that lobby and you die in 45th position with a SAM end of 1710 at the time
You’d get: 8 points; same situation dying in 96 with a SAM end of 1600 you’d lose 44 points
If you’d been 2nd with a SAM end of 1750 you’d earn 55 points and getting a Victory Royal with a SAM end of 1550 (at this point it’s the mean of your score and the one you beat in a 1v1) you’d earn 100 points with the bonus

For kills:
The score of the person that kills you matters to, getting killed by TSM Myth is different to getting killed by an 11 years old hiding behind the same tree for 5 minutes and not building. Same thing goes for the people that you kill, killing this same 11 years old (With all due respect to him, he is prolly a better player than me or has at least laid with my mother once) should be rewarded differently than killing Ninja for example.

 
Doing many kills in a game should be rewarded to so:


For each kill the amount of points you get is : (Score of the person you kill) / (Your score)


When you die you lose : 2\*(Your score) / (Score of the person that killed you) 


the number of kills you get in total is added to your score.

At the end of the game the number of points you get for your kills would be something like (example for 2 kills) :


(Score of 1st kill you got)/(Your score)+(Score of 2nd kill you got)/(Your score) + (Number of kills here 2)-(2\*Your score)/(Score of your killer)


Rounded up 


So at this end of each game you get points based on this formula:


((SAMstart\*Number of people in the lobby at start)/(Your score\*2)-(Position at which you end))/(SAMstart/SAMend)+(Number of kills)+∑(Score of the person you kill)/(Your score)


And either  -(2\*Your score)/(Score of your killer)  if you get killed 


or+50 if you get Victory Royal


Rounded up ^^


As you can see doing well is very rewarding 20+ kills game can get you 50 points or more on kills alone and getting a victory can get you up to 100 points, but doing poorly is also punishing you can lose up to 50 points if you die right from the start. The system is centered on expecting you to finish somewhere in the middle (A little lower if you’re in a good lobby or a little better if you’re in a bad lobby) so playing average games should get you 5-10 points or something.


People would be matched depending on their score (A lobby should have couple of low scores doing well lately couple of high scores doing badly and people at their normal level) allowing people who are worse at the game to actually enjoy it by fighting people that they can beat, and in terms maybe do their first Victory Royal and get better at shooting. And people who are really good at the game to get into a dick measuring contest to see who gets the highest score at the end of each seasons.

For Duo or Squads, the basic Idea is the same except that your score is modified by the score of other people in your squads / duo (If you duo with good players, your score would go up or down if you duo with bad players) so your score would be the mean of your team score and same for everyone, same your position will depend of your teams position, assists would count as 1/2 of a kill for duo and 1/4 for squads, and in the formula, Your score * 2 would become *4 or 8 depending or the mode (because it's used to determine the position at which your supposed to get to start earning points and in Duo the last place is 50 and squad 25).

So what do you think?

Before, I was not even aware of the net stats option because the performance never felt that bad (it might have been, just never noticed). Only now that the game is running perfectly client site, it is starting to become extremely noticeable: sometimes I break a box and it disappears 2 seconds later or open a door and end up walking through it and it opens 1 second later. This obviously affects my duels as well.

My in game settings ping shows 56 in EU, Germany which if I check cloudping.info (epic uses aws) seems to be right, and I would be getting that if I was being connected to actual European servers. Turning in net stats in game, I usually have over 150 ping which can be very annoying at times. That, followed by the rumours that the eu servers have gone missing, makes me think I am playing on NA servers (that's the ping that I would be getting there). My friends also report the same ping and we will live close to each other (Greece, EU). In other games thats the ping I get normally also (e.g. CS)

It worries me because epic doesn't seem to acknowledge this issue which is my biggest gripe with fortnite right now. Is there any word on the issue, what can we do to improve the situation?

Worth nothing my download speed in epic launcher is usually quite low as well (also uses aws)

I am a guy living in Belgium and I suffer from hyperacusis. What is this? This means that I hear a lot of noises much louder then other people do.  
Some examples of sounds that hurt my ears: beeping from microwave, slamming doors, beeping from scanners in stores and of course those gun shots in Fortnite Battle Rolaye!

The problem is that I need to turn my volume up in my headset to hear footsteps. And therefore the gunshots are very loud. I think the volumes of the gun shots should be lowered a bit so I can still hear footsteps but not damaging my ears bij those gunshot noises. 

I have to play with my ear plugs in while I have my headset on wich kind a helps but I think it shouldn't be this way. 

That's all I have to say :).

*You log onto his account (Guessing he doesn't have a PC since he play on PS4...) and accept your friend request.
                                                                                                                                                         
*Now when he is online on PS4 you can join his party by clicking on him and pressing ""Join Party"".
 
~~Note : He can't join you, you can only join him and the ingame voice chat sometimes bug up and you can't hear eachother or maybe I am the only one getting this bug with my PS4 Friends.~~

~~Conclusion : I don't know if this its on purpose by EpicGames but it is so cool and I feel kinda proud finding out this bug or exploit... :D~~

~~Hope you can play with you friends who didn't use their brain and chose PS4 before PC for gaming :P (Just joking) lol~~

**OKAY I FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS ALWAYS POSSIBLE AND NOT VERY UNCOMMON AND I WASN'T THE FIRST ONE TO FIND IT SORRY, THOUGHT I HAD BEEN SMART :(**

Your IP or machine, VPN usage, or for cheating. we recommend not utilizing VPN or proxy services while attempting to play fortnite.""

I figured it was because of a VPN program that I hadn't even used while playing fortnite. So I uninstalled all VPN programs on my computer. Then the next day when I tried to login my account had been deactivated. I contacted support to see what the cause of this was and they just answered that they don't give out information about what I was banned for and that the ban can not be lifted. I was wrongfully banned for cheating. This sucks because all of my friends play only Fortnite and I can't play with them at all. I would please like to have my ban checked again or tell me the reason I was banned so that I can remove the program. I think you should reconsider not just refraining on the battle-eye and check manually too, espicially if someone contacts support about it. I hope someone from Epic Games sees this thread and can do anything about this because it's just pure shit and is not fair at all for people being wrongfully banned and then just left to not being able to do anything about a huge injustice.",FortNiteBR

CQC battles making me rage quit this game.,"I have gone from being able to take out entire squads by myself using double pumps to not even being able to win a single 1v1 in the current shotgun meta.

So I got around the BS tactical shotgun damage for 6,7, and 16 by running the double pump or the pump AR combo.

Now that the pump has been double nerfed meaning no double pumps and neither can you alternate between pump and ARs I have no option but to play the tactical shotgun.

The problem with the tactical is that it does retarded damage as low as 7 6 and 16 and that is after connecting 5 out of my 8 shots on one single opponent.

Does anyone have any clues or advice or any video guides or ANYTHING to get better at shotgun fights in this game after the double pump nerf?

Have they said anything about removing the pump animation when running a pump and an AR/other primary?


The Pump and SMG is a possible solution but requires mastering the SMG.

The pump and tac is as useless as the tac alone. God forbid you miss your initial pump shot you can't do shit with the tactical since it does damages of 6 7 and 8. 

* Am I supposed to be scoping in for my tactical shotgun shots? 
* Am I supposed to be jumping? 
* Should my hipfire dot be on the persons head or what is the goal exactly?

HOW does one GUARANTEED win a shotgun battle in this game from now on?",FortNiteBR

I take fire, build a wall between me and the person... and their bullets not only go through right when I put the wall up, but also melt the wall so fast that they are hitting me again before I can lay down another one.

Did something change in the recent patch? I know walls and building got changed quite a bit... but this is just dumb. Now people just spam AR at me until their shots land... it's like I don't even have walls up at all. Every wall is like tissue paper and provides almost no protection at all.

I've been killed so many times when I'm behind my own walls that I had to come post this because honestly it's ruining my enjoyment of the game at this point.

I can't even sit behind solid walls because it only takes a few shots before I'm on the defensive having to constantly repair or replace walls and have to 100% focus on that instead of returning fire. By the time they reload they are already hitting my wall again before I can even peek them.

It's gotten to the point where I just leave my fort the moment someone gets too aggressive on destroying it because I'm 100% dead if I try to stay there (with the high ground cover advantage) This is just not right. The game is called ""FORT""nite but I don't feel very rewarded for building a fort. I just get bullet spammed like a sitting duck.

I just got 5th in a game because I threw up walls in front of me as I was being shot... wall in front of me and I get shot right through it for my death. Why?",FortNiteBR

Honestly I haven't landed Loot Lake since I found this out and will never again. If the storm is closing in around Loot Lake, I will actually just build a stairway to heaven and jump off.

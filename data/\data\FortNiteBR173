And if you do get in a fight, you'll get third-partied real quick. 

Everyone I talked to hates the redeployment. Everyone.

Epic claims to have mysterious positive feedback, at least that's what they said for justifying making it permanent. The only positive feedback they have is the increased sales of gliders, which is the real reason why redeployment is staying (people see more of their gliders and want better ones = more sales = more $$$). Why do you think they make focussed feedback threads for the storm instead of redeployment? Simple answer, because the feedback will be overwhelmingly negative, but they want it to stay in because $$$.",FortNiteBR

Shotgunned in the face right as the cube exploded? Sprayed by a prayer's compact smg right before big Kev' began spinning?

Well, I propose a new mechanic *SPECIFICALLY FOR LIVE EVENTS*: _ghost mode!_

The idea came to me as I saw a dusk mercilessly slaughter about six players as we danced on one of Kevin's islands. Two of which I had taken many L's with before. After I saw my mates die, I had an idea, which I've, as of now, been dwelling on for the entire afternoon.

Instead of just making you spectate the player who killed you, or your last braindead squadmate, give the player a chance to still experience the events!

As a ghost, you can't:
Pick up any items,
Cause any damage to players or the environment,
Be seen by living players,

However, you can:
Move in any direction on the x,y,z axis
Use the right click to focus on something far away,
See other ghosts,

And most importantly:
You still get to see and experience the event, as if you were still alive!

I know it isn't a perfect concept, but the alternatives are:
Actually getting better at the game so you can survive long enough to see the event,
Epic adding a passive mode to participate in the event,
Or players die and then watch the IGN video half an hour after the event.

*TL;DR* if you die during a live event, come back as a ghost and still see it, without any available opportunity to interfere with living players, only for the time period of the event.

80,YCorey,1541392120,9uaiug,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9uaiug/why_i_now_dislike_fortnite/,1,Why I now dislike Fortnite.,"So, I've been playing Fortnite consistently since around mid October of 2017. When I first started playing the game, I really enjoyed it and wanted to continue playing it. However, ever since S5 came out, I have been less motivated each day to play Fortnite because of the removal of so many cool things such as double pump and the rise of the ""spray and pray"" meta. I would constantly die due to some kid camping in a bush with his drum gun, or a something similar to that. Fortnite lost its skill gap, and I ultimately think that is the worst thing to ever happen to Fortnite and is the main reason I don't want to continue playing this game. Now, I know that with the release of Season 6 more than a month ago at this point, some guns that added to Season 5's meta were removed, but at the same time other weapons were added and more weapons that were already OP were getting buffed to even further eliminate the skill gap between players who actually have developed skill for the game and players that just started playing last week. I believe that this is most evident with the addition of quad launchers to the game. (which are literally unstoppable right now) On top of this, Fortnite is updating so rapidly, that there is always some sort of glitch that Epic Games has overlooked. For example, as of now, a lot of the time when I try to re-deploy my glider, it either won't let me for some reason, or it will automatically cancel while I'm still in the air or something along the line. There are so many more reasons that I don't like Fortnite anymore, but this is all I could come up with so far. If this post gets deleted for some reason, so be it. I'll just re-upload it.",FortNiteBR

I figure it's best if we focus on one thread to get our voices heard so maybe Epic reconsiders.

If you want glider re-deploy gone, post here.

Here's a few things I think glider re-deploy basically ruins.

- I would occasionally carry Shockwave Grenades before re-deploy became a thing.  Now I don't.

- I never use ATKs in squads anymore.

- I never use quads in duos anymore.

- The lunch pads usage has been severely diminished.  Now it's only used as a quick escape.

- The storm is rarely an issue anymore.  Much fewer people die to it and it's harder to use to your advantage.

- Third partying has gotten even worse.

- Beating someone in a build battle results in the loser just jumping away to reset.

- Building high no longer feels scary.


The mechanic just runs rampshot over a bunch of cool Fortnite things.  It's homogonized the game and taken out the ability to create a certain number of ""Fortnite stories"" with our friends.  Epic, please get rid of it.

The shadows of our acquainted Cube have dissipated, the monsters of darkness banished, we have learned of a Nexus of Dimensions, and the map is literally gleaming brighter than ever before with sunshine and rainbows.

Something, is awry.

Season 6 is dubbed Darkness Rises. It’s only week 6, and the darkness has been defeated this quickly? Obviously, we just had a live event and things should be quite for a bit. However, this is a different conclusion to our previous situation with the Visitor and the Rocket Launch.

The conclusion of the first live event, left a crack in time and space over our world, allowing different realities and timelines to converge onto the island.

The conclusion of the Cube’s passing, darkness has been banished, and light is returning to the island in a way unlike ever before. There’s no catastrophe, or urgency.

What began with a comet in the sky, has finally concluded with no other signs strife of mystery. There is still the hidden Season skin, but that may just be Fortnite’s next phase.

We may have finally concluded what may have been the “beginning,” of a much larger story.

Where does this leave us?

The game has already grown adding so many other tools for this exact purpose that it's hardly a necessary remedy. ATKs, quadcrashes, chillers, launch pads, grapple guns, rifts, port a rifts, shadow cubes, the boost pads at infected areas, the vaulted impulses and bouncers, shockwave grenades, balloons, shopping carts, all of those are inferior to simply building a ramp at any point to fly somewhere.

Its cool that you want to stream and grow up to be just like ninja and tfue. Its also great that fortnite has a streamer mode that hides your name from other players, but you are not a streamer. You hide your name from the 2 people that even know your stream exists because you assume that people are gonna stream snipe you but don't realise that you aren't even worth the effort. So while you build and get 5 kills average and making your way to the top 15 or when you die at the beginning like a fool, no one cares. The worst of you is console streamers, the 20 of you in one game don't even know how screwed you are because you stream console, you either have to be really good or you have to be really funny, something that no one would know because you are a no name wannabe. So keep on trying to get famous playing the game and just know that everytime we see *streamer[302]...* we make fun of you, especially on console.

I was wondering if anyone else felt or thought the same way I did?


To also be clear I don’t give a shit about rarity or being “og” I like the skin for the skin itself not because like 1% of the player have it.

Thanks for ready :)",FortNiteBR

Unfortunately, Kevin fails and the simulation overcomes the cube, sending us back to the simulated fight world. Because it has used all his power, his cube is black and destroyed as he is drained.

Also, we're literally taken by teleporters when shot enough.

The new meta that you guys introduced is nothing but cucklords third partying other people because they can build to sky limit and take 0 repercussions. 

I'm tired of getting in build fights and there be no risk of doing so. People don't take fall damage anymore, you just fly away. 

I'm tired of the enemies I'm fighting getting outbuilt and just flying away. Yeah I can pull my glider too and go chase them but it's an never ending battle of who can fly away the quickest and fastest. It's the most aggravating game concept right now and I can not stand the way this game is being played.

From start to finish, it feels like the future duration of the cube event (from the lightning strike to today) was justified with that event. 10/10. Zero complaints.

And yet, the actual result seems anti-climactic. We went through an entire two months of the cube, to that amazing live event....and all that changed was a little portion of the map. Like....all that power and energy the cube had and Loot is the only thing that changed? Idk.

At some point, they're really going to have to shake things up. Then entire screen went white and everyone was in some kind of astral plane. I'm sure most people were thinking a new map. Touch the butterfly, drop back into the map only to see Leaky.

Now you may ask why and how do traps need to be nerfed? Here’s my proposition: Traps are waaay to plentiful and powerful in game and they do 150 damage I think the damage should be reduced to somewhere between 80-125 because it’s unfair to have Full HP and 2 minis popped and still get owned by a trap placed from a dead player; traps should also break or deactivate if the player that placed them died unless the said player’s teammates are still alive.

I understand there is skill behind trap placement when you trap a player during a build fight, which is why I think they should be nerfed to somewhere along 80-125 dmg and the rarity of traps should be upgraded to blue (rare) and the spawn frequency/floor loot spawn should be reduced so not every single player in the entire game has them.

I haven't played games in any serious length of time since Quake 3 and EverQuest, basically... until Fortnite.

So it's either I remain silent and quit and vote wholeheartedly with my wallet and time, or I try absolutely any and everything to get someone to notice that the game is going in a direction that the majority of players disagree with.

So Epic, if you're looking for profit with more glider sales, it's going to backfire.

Epic, if you are going to have once in a lifetime events please re-think your stratergy.

I think I can speak for a lot of people when I say, I got killed three times and didn't get to see the event. It really sucks because now I'm going to have to watch some clickbait youtuber watch the event for me.

If an live event ever happens in the future, please take the precautions to make it people can actually watch the event you work so hard on each season.

I think the only problem I have with traps, however, is the lack of them. I can go a whole game without finding any traps, and I can also find millions of traps. I think that by the end of the game, each player should have traps proportional to the amount and quality of their weapons, so how do we do that?

Make it so chests drop one trap, as well. Now, hear me out here, let's go through some pros.

Pro: People get more loot out of chests, therefore making them more rewarding. 
Pro: It'll mean more players will have traps, making it more rewarding to get kills. 
Pro: If it's easier to get traps, half the challenge of killing people with them for challenges won't be getting them in the first place. 
Pro: With easier access to traps, people can get more epic plays with them, and think of entire new uses and strategies for them. Think of the clips you would see pop up here if people were guaranteed traps every game. 
Pro: Could be a good way to add another trap in the game, therefore adding more variety.
Pro: Everyone already wants launchpads to become less rare, and this is a way to increase your chances of getting one. 

However, there are some cons I have to address. 

Con: Could make the trap kill challenges too easy for some of the more hardcore players.
Con: Even though everyone wants launchpads to become more rare, I can see how it could be annoying to start shooting at someone and immediately have them throw up a launch pad
Con: You have to look up more when going into buildings.


Tl;dr Make it so every chest contains at least one trap as well as the customary weapon and consumable.

Please vault every weapon in the game. it doesnt make sense that we have to take damage. Im trying to survive and i lose health when players put their cursors over me? What is this?  There needs to be some kind of gun control because i keep dying!   Heres my suggestion.  Remove guns and replace them with hugs that give players health instead of taking it a way. The person with the most amount of health at the end of the round wins. 

Seriously though, there's a vocal portion of reddit that's on today that's trying to make a concerted effort to remove the pump and make this game some kind of bullet sponge game where it takes 30 bullets to kill someone.  What's next?  Nerf the bolt?  Nerf editing? 

Pump shotgun play is what is fun to me. Weapon switching is what's fun to me.  

I've double pumped and lost to someone with the pump-+tac smg because I missed the first shot and they killed me with the SMG in-between my switching because my weapon delay was so long. that's the consequences. that's the risk versus reward.  you're forced to build to get high ground because fighting in a face to face situation is EXTREMELY risky. the first to expose yourself should be punished immediately. Missing the one tap with the pump should be punished immediately. 

I dont want to play another 1 in one-millionth game where AR is king. i don't want this game to be bloom battles with the pistol to endgame. Shotguns are the worst weapon in every other game except this one and you're all trying to change one of the core mechanics of what this game has been built on.

Don't tell me that shotguns aren't supposed to be effective at a certain range because IRL all bullets can potentially one tap if the aim is right.

The pump shotgun is what makes fortnite great. Let's keep that way.

People are all shouting ""buff the heavy, it sucks!"" If we nerf the pump from one-shotting opponents, it will balance out the combat. I think we all noticed while playing solid gold LTM, that we enjoyed ourselves more. This is because there was no stress of being rushed by a black knight and being destroyed immediately without preparation. The pump is what makes this game stressful and frustrating for all players not completely on their game; If we took off 10-12 from the pump's base damage, one shot headshots would do approximately 165, giving the victim a good 2 seconds to react.
I'm prepared for the downvotes, as I am well aware of the pump's popularity, I just feel as though this matter needs to be addressed by Epic and balance changes are quite in order.",FortNiteBR

Dark Vanguard and Leviathan- Both of these were season 3 themed and came back in season 4 despite them being season 3 themed. This debunks the theory that Red Knight can’t return because it belongs to the Fort Knights set and cant return in Season 4 because that’s not the theme.

Toothpick and Pressure- The pickaxe toothpick which is part of the Red Knight set appeared today, and this’ll make more sense in the next paragraph. The community has been giving Epic a lot of pressure lately to bring it back to the item shop.

100th day anniversary- The 100th day anniversary is tommorow for Red Knight and it makes sense to release its pickaxe a day before. This would be a perfect time for Epic Games to put Red Knight into the item shop.

In conclusion, Red Knight will hopefully return tomorrow and I hope Epic will listen to the community.

Thank you.

But I do think it's clear that the jetpack allows players to opt out of two major parts of the game:

**Locational awareness:** It's nearly impossible to tell where a jetpack user is in relation to you at any given time. The directional audio in this game is already iffy, but normally you would be able to see a player building up to you and follow their trail. Unless you have eyes on a jetpack user, you can't tell where they are.

**High grounding:** This one is pretty straightforward. Jetpacks give players automatic high ground over builders. Not only can jetpack users jump on top of built high ground, *they can more effectively build it themselves.* Moreover, jetpack users can build wherever they want, since they have no risk of fall damage.

Can somebody change my mind on this? Jetpacks seem like a major design flaw of the game right now.",FortNiteBR

If you have a base someone with a jetpack can easily just fly up with walls and easily counter you without an issue - There really isn't a counter to this because it's impossible to gain the high ground against a decent player with the jetpack (just fly up and you're on the high ground). I was playing today and I saw a nice 1x1 and flew up and INSTANTLY took the high ground and he couldn't do anything but build out where I could then just fly up and then kill him. Sure, the inaccuracy serves for it but the problem is is the fact that I can still go down and such.

I actually feel like I'm abusing it when I use it.

NEXT TOPIC: Skybases
When using a jetpack you can feel free to make a skybase without an issue because the jetpack allows you to glide down with ease. Once again in squads and such you can really just abuse skybases and sure they can build up or break it but as stated earlier you can just regain the highground and/or fly down to safety. I know they're going for gimmicky items and I know it's a 'limited time item' however it's proven to stick til' the end of the season.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you may say ""Well the jetpacks are uncommon, their rarity serves the purpose."" Sure, I agree to an extent, however I've seen  at least a 1/3 of the lobby get one by endgame.

Also Epic did say that they didn't want to add things that didn't suit the feel of Fortnite and the Zapatron was removed due to that and the jetpack is also unfitting unless they are used in a different way; You could have a burst effect where you shoot up into the air and this will stop skybases as it can't simply let you go down, it could also have a charge feature where you have to hold down a button to charge up (like thanos) and then go up into the air and then have a burst to counter falldamage. You could, unlike thanos, charge it for a few seconds and have a smaller burst up. Sure, this may not feel like a real jetpack but it'll serve a strong way and since the jetpack is staying until the end of the season it might actually be a nicer change to add balance to a normal user VS a jetpack player. I do believe the jetpack has a place in Fortnite but not how it is right now.

It seems that the majority of people that complain about the fun new items added into Fortnite \(Hop Rocks, Shopping Carts and Jet Packs\), are the sweaties. They are the people who are getting upset over the integrity of the game. These are the sweaties, i'm generalizing here, but these are the people that want a ""fair"" playing field and would most likely play in a competitive playlist if they had the option.

If we give these sweaties a place to play where these fun items aren't included, I think that would reduce the amount of bitching and complaining round' these parts. The competitive players can play their even playing field matches while the rest of us can have fun and enjoy Epic's creativity! Win win?

This of course always creates a divide in the community, but I think with Fornites high pouplation, it should be a non\-issue. This also introduces another aspect of ""hah look at this pleb with his 1000 social wins, get gud kid get those in competitive"". This is an unfortunate response to adding ranked playlists into games and is unavoidable. 

I personally would play the shit out of both playlists, if they were to create a split. Grind out my games in competitive until I just want to casually take sweet jumps in my shopping cart. 

**TLDR:**  I think if they add in a competitive playlist, the complaints about these wacky items will drop off and everyone will have more fun!",FortNiteBR

1. Log in to your xbox live account on 10 different days.

2. Play fortnite for at least 30 minutes on 5 different days.

3. Download 2 games with gold

The first two are easy enough that if you don't have them completed, then you're not the type of person to care about a fortnite reward which will most likely be v-bucks. 

So that leaves the third challenge which is easy itself. Just download that terrible baseball game and metal gear V and you should be set. Not sure if the xbox 360 games count.

I've been playing this game for a while and what never made sense to me is that when none of my friends were online and I wanted to play with someone likeminded I couldn't find any decent tool to do that. All I could find is the variation of the same forum format and I could never remember to come back to check if people replied or not. I also had a few experiences where people lied about their stats or had a completely new account with 2 games and 8 kd. Being a computer peeps me and a few mates decided we'd build an app that makes finding duo/squad partners **fast**, **reliable**, and **interesting**. 

Basically it's an app that shows you cards of players and allows you to swipe right or left to either show you want to play with them or you don't \(like in Tinder\) and if you both match you can chat and set up when you're going to play! We're planning to add fun challenges that you can complete together to get to know your duo better!

I’m not sure if it’s because they want the kill, or to ruin the other teams gameplay, or in SOME cases collect much needed loot and materials. It seems to be so bad that sometimes they end up eliminated after killing someone they’ve downed, leaving one team with one less player who is not only bored, but can’t help his teammate(s) out. 

An easy and simple solution to that would be giving downed players 100 shield. They would still bleed out health, but both shield and health protect you from gunshots and explosives. Similar to when fighting in the storm with shield. This would counteract lots of sweaty thirsting.

But yes, you can sill thirst easily. If you have the time before their teammates arrive, you could easily spray them with and AR, throw a few nades at them, or one pump the in the head. 

Overall, I believe this is a positive change that would bring more joy and bonding within the Fortnite community. The next time you get thirsted or thirst when you know you shouldn’t have, think of this post.

And if they’re closer to you they can spam grenades under all your stuff it blows it all up and then you’re dead when you hit the ground from the other 4 or 5 that are on the ground. Most of the guns in the game are fairly balanced and whatever I don’t want to get into that discussion. But the grenade launcher takes little to no skill it’s just spamming explosives towards people and there’s almost no counter to it.

What’s the best way to get it higher. 

Also some just general tips on how to get better would be great aswell.

- Pistol: same as revolver, keep silenced pistol remove pistol and make it a bit more accurate;

- Grey burst: nothing serious and idk if it's just me but I cry when I get a grey burst, I'm happy with a green or blue, but I get really sad getting a grey, I think it's cause the icon looks ugly;

- LMG: just remove it, it's basically a much better version of the minigun and it's overpowered in many scenarios but not consistent enough to see any play. Basically just an annoying item that you don't really want to either get or play against;

- Grenade Launcher: Nerf damage to 70-80, as Tfue and others have said it's the best gun in the game and it's overpowered;

- Clinger: Remove it and instead make C4 able to stick to players. Making C4 useful and a really, really funny item, while removing a broken and useless item (it's broken cause basically you throw 2 of those at a guy boxed into a 1x1 and even if the guy is spamming walls he will still get hit by it cause first one breaks it and second one will only explode 0.2 seconds later and do damage);

- Port-a-Fort: Remove it, this game is about getting high ground you really should stop adding items that do that for you. just build lol;

- Jet pack: Remove it should never have been added to the game;

- Hop Rocks and huge hole in the map aka dusty divot: Hope its temporary and gets removed soon;

- Apples and mushrooms: Not a big fan, you should work for your health and go on places with loot (aka risky places) not hang around a forest and look for apples and mushrooms. But not a big deal either I guess;

- Crossbow: Don't know why it was removed, just make it a floor drop instead of chest. I also believe most snipers should be floor drops except the legendary ones;

- Bonus - Opening chests: Whoever opens it should get a slight advantage at picking up the weapons, nothing more RNG than someone landing on your roof late and you having a press ""pick up"" fight for your life.

Obviously they see that its killing the competitive nature of the game. Why can someone build as high as they want, but resist all fall damage with a tap of the space bar. Makes absolutely no sense. All of this combined with the fact that people phase through your structures makes for great fights.

What I mean by that is I have no skills whatsoever. I don't find myself improving at all in Fortnite after over 900 matches or so with 287 eliminations, nor do I have a single solo,squad or duo win. 

Here's what happens in my average match:

I either land Junk Junction or Lucky landing that used to be my philosophy to land there as a newbie at the game. However as I started to become better adjusted to the game and slowly accepting the learning curve of Fortnite, I discovered that I was terrible at fighting so I took some advice online and decided to land at crowded places on the map like tilted towers or retail row depending on the bus's direction and how close it was to those places. Before long I started getting 2 kills a game 3 if I was lucky and 4 on my really good days combined with luck. Then here's the kicker, I followed advice online to build in empty areas of the map, and I did. But still even after over 900 matches or so and 287 eliminationsI did not see any improvement in my building or my building habits, I thought it would become muscle memory by then but I guess not.

Now I know people upon reading this will tell me generic or textbook answers on how to win Fortnite games but I am not looking for wins, I AM JUST LOOKING GOT A SHRED OF CONSISTENCY in my improvement at the game. It's painful really, the game you love you're bad at. 

Before anyone says it, this isn't me being a camping bitch. This is me trying to get better at fighting in Fortnite by getting into as many fights as possible. But I get crushed every 1v1 and only when I'm lucky after a long fight somehow I get a kill.

So to be specific what I'm really looking for is consistency, I have over 900 matches played with 287 eliminations in Fortnite but my real question is how many more  matches will I finally see improvement? Or should I just quit the game? I'm really confused and I need help.

Please be kind but also constructively criticize your answers. I do not need those comments saying ""get good kid."" Just  solid advice on what I can do from here.

Thanks :)

They looked like fun untill i looked at teams of 20. ""All stats except for wins are counted in this mode."" When i read that i was sure they had to be joking. They record your stats but not your wins? So does this mean playing this mode can only increase your kills and matches played? 

It feels like epic is going the wrong way with LTM's and stat recording. In my opinion they should have stats for LTM's seperate from the others. You'll probably be thinking nobody cares about their stats just play what you enjoy. Well there are a lot of people who enjoy playing for stats and right now it's going the wrong way. 

Players who were around during the shooting test know that even though this is a shooting test that should be on a test realm they would have their stats recorded. This might of have changed your overal stats if you played these a lot and won't be a good representative of your actual skill when looked up by other players. 

My solution is either get seperate stats for LTM's or don't count them at all. Some change the core mechanics of the game so much so that you can as a bad/good player have a mode you're great/bad at but having this mixed in with your normal stats will not represent your skill in normal modes.

TLDR: Stats in V4.3 20v2 mode are tracked for everything except for wins. Solution track LTM stats and seperate them from normal mode stats.",FortNiteBR

Hate me as much as you want, but I will keep jumping away from team at outskirts or isolated locations so that I can gather resources before jumping in fights. If you can't take down 3-4 people and still jump on crowded location, you are just committing suicide and I ain't going down so easily.

I have played so many games where squad members have jumped on crowded location and died in first 2-3 minutes while I have survived till top 10 by gathering resources, building and killing one at time.",FortNiteBR

Just a fun game, good times and bad, these past 4 weeks have been FUN. I feel like people on reddit take the game TOO seriously and TOO try hard sometimes to appreciate the good things. 

Thinking negatively for too long can warp your perception and make most things negative for you.   

So! Let’s all talk about your favorite things in/about fortnite.


I like the art style and how it seems to pop on screen. I also like the wide array of items and weapons that do funny things. The building is fun and any game with llamas is A-OK in my book.   The variety of unlockables with a battle pass and the variety in random daily shops also keep interest for the future. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of getting a victory Royale with your buddies or hell, even in solo.  As you dance on top of all the fallen players. 

So, what do you enjoy about fortnite?  I’m interested

My Response- Yea the pump is the primary weapon used to kill most people. But the problem isn’t that the pump is OP. The problem is that any range weapon ( AR, Rockets, Sniper etc.) can be countered by spamming walls in front of you till the other person or team stops shooting. This makes using anything other than a shotgun pointless because you’ll just sit there in a stale mate till one of you either runs out of bullets or materials. 

The Fix- Put a 1 second delay on building ONLY if you have built more than 3 pieces in the same spot in less than 3 seconds. This would force players to either A- build up making rockets more effective at range because of fall damage or B- back down making snipers and ARs more viable for pick off kills while the player is running. In theory this would eliminate a lot of close quarters gun fights. 

Closing- Running and putting up walls is a strategy and useful. BUT sitting in a 1x1 and spamming walls is just hiding and slows down game play incredibly. The only counter to this is rushing with a shotty before they can put themselves in a box 

Point 2- shottys are the only viable close range weapon.

My Response- Yes and No. yes the pump is by far the best close range weapon because of its damage. BUT if a good player has a tac shotty and they hit there shots and you miss one shot with a pump you will die. Also if you don’t hit a headshot the advantage of using a pump is gone.

The Fix- Make the time between shots on the pump fractionally longer and reduce the clip size to 3. Then give the tac shotty a smaller bloom. For the heavy reduce the time between shots. For the smg give it better range and less bloom making it better in intermediate gun fights. And for pistols nothing it’s a pistol it’s a last resort not a primary weapon. 


Sorry for such a long post. This a polarizing topic and just removing something because it’s unbalanced is never the answer. There are a lot of problems with this game that rushing with a pump can mask and these are just 2 that I wanted to address ",FortNiteBR

Hello Fortnite Battle Royalers!

If you were looking for free coaching by any chance you landed on the right thread!

I am a player with a lot of experience and I know the game thoroughly!I have queued up with a bunch of pro players and we have been helping each other learn from our mistakes,sharing tips etc.

Here is how it works: You can ask me anything you want about situations in the game where you just don't know what went wrong!And accompany it with a short clip if the situation was quite sticky!

The reason I do this is that I love helping people and educating at something that will bring them joy!

If you are interested contact me at dimitrismpalaskas@hotmail.gr

Have a nice one!

P.S(I am the player with the 17 wins.I deleted the last one but I regretted it because a lot of people came for me for advice and now they are better players and know what they should do!)

Every player starts with a revolver with one shot in it, shots do 101 damage (instakill) Kill a player and you get another bullet. Harvesting tools also do 101 damage and a kill with that will also grant you a bullet.

In order to use the calculator, you must do the following:

1. Go to this link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lxTSLL8X8679HxEO417I7typ5als8SJqnsyf7999yY8/edit?usp=sharing this is the document that has the calculator and xp chart on in.

2. Go to the top left and click ""File""

3. Either click make a copy if you want to continue using google or click Download as if you prefer to use another program

4. Once you have the document downloaded just follow the instructions listed below and all the math will be done automatically.

I hope this calculator can help people with pacing and help them figure out how far they will get by the end of the season.

First of all, you get different Kill XP depending on what mode you're playing, which also means you only really benefit from playing with friends if they have the Battle Pass for the friend boost.

Example: Solo 10 kills: 180 XP, Squads 10 kills: 80 XP.

Then there were also inconsistencies, I've had multiple games with 14 kills in Squads and they either gave me 60 or 80 XP (all with the same mates).

Another interesting thing I had was I've got 60 XP for 4 kills in squads, but in another game I gained 40 XP for 5 kills and this really doesn't make any sense.

The only thing I can imagine causing this is either: Assists give kill XP too, or different circumstances give different amounts of XP (example, you killed someone with a rocket launcher: 10XP, you kill someone with a shotgun: 5XP)

So if anyone from Epic Games sees this, I'd like to know: 

1. Why exactly are the XP you get for the SAME amount of kills different? 

2. Why is it so overly complicated? Why isn't it following a simple rythm like for example Solo per kill: +20XP, Duo per kill: +15XP, Squads per kill: 10XP?",FortNiteBR

This change felt terrible and made the pump unreliable because at times the gun wouldn't shoot even after you clearly pumped it. Now, these issues are gone, but double pump is back and dominating the meta. The easiest, safest way to fix this without doing something that could, once again, have unwanted side effects would be to gray out the second pump/heavy you pick up. This way, you can no longer double pump or double heavy, but you can still hold a second pump for a teammate or pick up another pump to deny opponents of it during the early game.

(100 Drops in Moisty Mire Data),"Hey i'm Azzinorth! So a couple of weeks ago i was wondering - How much does your landing spot matter in terms of winning games?.

So i took it upon myself to gather some data, i decided to land 100 times in Moisty Mire.

Why Moisty Mire?

Valid question, i choose Moisty Mire for a couple of reasons

There's a lot of wood materials easily available, the big trees in Moisty give you 100+ wood

It's on the edge of the map, so usually there's very little competition for the loot there

There's a TON of gear there, it's crazy.

The Results

You can check out all the data yourself, heres a link to the Google Docs i made: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lEBDFD4FVevrxWJctZWz-artrQPKkSsc6VYZjjwu_ic/edit?usp=sharing

I also made i video explaining all the data, so if you prefer to sit back and relax and just view a video explaining everything here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMkibtjinhs

Before i started landing in Moisty Mire just a few days into season 4 i had a win % of 7.20%

Out of my 100 games landing in Moisty Mire i won 29 and lost 71, giving me a win % of 29% - increasing my win percentage by a whopping 21.8%

Pretty significant if you ask me. Here's the rest of the data:

Average kills per game: 3.54 Highest kill game: 11 Average kills in MM: 1.02 Average placement: 12.25* Average chests looted in MM: *4.15 Average shields after looting MM: **79.45 Games with 0 shields after MM: 10 Games with 100+ shields after MM: 67 Games with the first zone covering MM: 32 Loot lamas looted in MM: 5 Average wood after MM: 742.25 Games with 999 wood after MM: 36

All these things factor into why my win percentage increased so significantly. This does proves that landing in Moisty Mire will increase your win percentage significantly. This data could translate into other spots that is at the edges of the map.

Which spot should i do next? Let me know in the comments.

This is the end of the post The rest under here is shameless selfplugging

Shotguns are one of the most used guns in the game. For real, who do you find in this game that does not carry a shotgun? At close range, no SMG, Pistol, or AR, comes close to the deadly Pump. 

Now heres the triggering part, prepare yourself. You can severely outplay someone with crazy edits and builds to get the high ground, but all is lost if they hit ONE shot to your head. A RPG can't even one shot someone with shield. 

The Heavy and the Tactical shotguns are however, balanced. The heavy shotgun, an epic/legendary shotgun, is taken over an uncommon pump. Just let that sink in.

TL;DR: Pump shotguns are taken over the Heavy Shotgun, which should not be a thing. Also being able to one pump anyone with full shield should not be a thing either.

I said fuck it and stopped playing for a few days. Today I got on and dropped a 9 kill loss followed by an 11 kill win. Just wondering if anyone feels the same when they take breaks. I think it might be because when I’m playing regularly and sweating, I expect to constantly play well and never die, but after a break I’m not taking it too seriously and maybe I make better decisions?",FortNiteBR

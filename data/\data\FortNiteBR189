I appreciate that expanding the time that it’s open would increase peoples chances of meeting the score threshold, but perhaps that could be offset by increasing the score needed or limiting you to a certain amount of matches?

&amp;#x200B;

The main advice is : DON'T loose time by looking for Victory. 

I mean, what i did was clearly simple :

Land Retail Row/ Tilted Towers, take 3 kills, suicide. Repeat 20 times, in tilted you just take 3 kills in a single minute if you land properly

&amp;#x200B;

 Trying to get Victory royale + 7 kills will take at least 20 minutes. But when you have a little amount points and there's one hour left, just stop trying to get points from top10/3/1 and focus and getting 3 kills then suicide, i did it at the end and just got 13 points in 46mn.. (Loading screen took at least 5-6 minutes in all these game and there's one game where i took 5 kills before suicide)

&amp;#x200B;

Well it's just a little advice and i hope it will help someone . Good Luck ",FortNiteBR

At the moment, the only people who have a chance to actually to get 20pts are kids getting home from school or someone who finishes work and is home before 5pm. Not to mention that if you have kids, trying to fit 3hrs of games in around dinner, bath and bed time is almost impossible.

I had 1hr to play after work and it was actually impossible for me to score 20pts in that time. 

My thinking is that you get 2hrs of playtime across a certain period of time. This could be a whole day or it could be over 12 hours or 6 hours. Once the bus starts, the timer starts. When you die, the timer stops. This way, everyone has a chance to compete.

I get that this is the first one and it was just a practice tournament, but hopefully the competition is fairer in future tournaments.

Lately however, over the last month+ I've noticed that he's been getting very salty when things aren't going well for him. For example, just now, his squad was all fighting another squad, and he was boxed in and just his tone was like ""Uhhh Hello? Is someone going to help me?!"" As if they aren't dealing with their own shit in the battle.

That is only one example but there have been streams where you could tell even Tim, Lupo and others could feel his negativity. Like, they got really quiet and didn't know what to say kinda thing. Just like ""Yea man, sucks...""

I don't know what's going on with him, maybe something IRL is dragging him down, you never know. It's just something I noticed over the last month.

Whatever the case, I wish him well and hope that everything IS okay, because I do very much enjoy watching his stream! He's a great role model for kids that want to get into gaming, and overall a great entertainer!

We all have our bad days, I've just noticed he's been kinda salty more often than just once in a while lately.

The first hour and a half of my gameplay did not count and I ended with 11, but if the SBMM was fixed by the end I'm skeptical I would have been able to get the 20 even with my first part counting (as the matches would have gotten even harder)

I didn't think it would be such a big deal going up against PC players, but I've never been completely destroyed as hard as I was by some of these players.. Everybody hit their shots, headshots, always - jumping out sideways from the build and hitting a headshot. Player turtling in a box, shooting gold scar at his box, builds a ramp edits the roof hunting rifle headshots me instantly. 

I suppose my strategy was not ideal playing it like scrims, as some of my landings I would spend the whole time running, and then get 1 point for Top 10 but not get the 3 kills for another point. Feels like a complete waste, to spend all that time just for 1 point.

I think that for the coming days I will try to land somewhere where I can get 3 kills at the start, and then play the rest like a scrim... I don't think it works just going for the scrim play from the start because the win is only worth 2 points more than top 10.

Everyone in my lobby thanking the boss driver / anyone that killed me was Twitch/YouTube. I get that it's supposed to be a hard tournament, but I feel like the odds are too far stacked against me on console going against some of these 'pro' PC players.

I feel like the rationale of ""Nickmercs and Ayden are able to do it, so we thought it should all be cross-play"" is ridiculous to me. Out of the pro tournaments, if less than 5% of the players are console users, doesn't Epic understand that it takes some 99.99 percentile player (exaggeration) to compete with the PC players? It is silly to base their decision upon extreme outliers. Yes, I know that the gap has been decreased by 6.1 (not that enough time has really past yet to adjust to it - like would you as a PC player want to change your sensitivity on the day of the Alpha tournament? No.) but the gap is still huge, and makes no sense for it to be cross-play. I think that it is more of a laziness / out of necessity for the servers kind of thing than ""all players are equal"" notion. ",FortNiteBR

Top 3 placement: 2pts
Victory Royale: 5pts

2 kills: 1pt
5 kills: 3 pts
8+ kills : 5pts

The next issue is the cross platform. I got suspicious while playing on mobile seeing massive build fights which normally don't happen on mobile. I figured it was just more competitive players on mobile. After a match I decided to add the person who killed me, they added me back and sure enough they were on PS4. I actually got into voice chat and he mentioned that it seemed like their were lots of PC players too. The other person who added me back shortly after was on PC, although I never talked to him. They did specifically say there would be a way to opt out if cross platform, but there's no option to do so.

The last issue I wanted to address was the amount of teamers I have encountered. I recorded one clip of two people giving each other weapons and sitting in the same build until they were the last 2. There was another match I had where 5 Cuddle Team Leaders were hunting people down in a pack ad at the end the other people just let the other guy from the group kill them.

Earlier today we launched the in-game tournament system and hosted the first session of the Alpha Tournament on the EU server.  We'd like to provide an update on several known issues, what we're still investigating, and what you might expect as we iron out issues within the system throughout the week.

**Server Capacity**

The sudden influx of players attempting to search for matches at the start of the tournament caused some issues with our matchmaking services as they attempted to balance match assignment in response to the demand.  We are updating our matchmaking strategy to better accommodate the rush of players at the start of a tournament.

**Schedule &amp; Tournament Regions**

An issue was identified where often the 'Tournament Region' displayed in the Events tab would indicate a player was viewing the event list for 'North America'.  This is a visual bug only, each region has their own tournament schedule and all times displayed inside of the Events tab are correct based on your local timezone and system clock.

**Incorrect Scores**

We have a couple known issues around incorrect scores:

Scenario one - players did not receive any points because they were not being matched into the tournament correctly - despite it appearing as if they were.  Restarting the game would fix this issue and allow you to earn points.  This should now display an error if you try to matchmake with this issue, and we’ll be fixing in a future release.

Scenario two - players may incorrectly either receive a point or not get credit for reaching an elimination or placement goal.  However, the correct score would be shown after a 2-3 minute delay or the next time a player returned to the Lobby.  We’re actively investigating a fix for this, but your score should be correct at the end of an event currently.

Unfortunately, any points lost during this event will not be recoverable.

**Matchmaking**

The tournament system is intended to match you against players with similar score during the session, becoming less strict in its search over time to ensure you find a match eventually.  Players who have higher scores should expect longer matchmaking times and tougher matches, while players with lower scores should expect an easier time as many of the higher scoring players filter out.

Currently we're finding that this isn't working correctly and is resulting in matches that are more mixed in score than we intended, especially when it comes to players with high scores during the event.  We'll be continuing to iterate on this to provide a better matched experience, so expect this to fluctuate regularly.

\-------------------------------

We're also keeping an eye on feedback for things like tournament scheduling, scoring formats, and visual presentation to help inform future development after we've gotten everything working as intended.  Dive into the [tournament system blog](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/esports/en-US/news/in-game-tournaments-announcement) and [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSjJS2vSMA) for some insight into where we'll be taking the feature going forward.",FortNiteBR

177,starfinn_,1539729630,9oslgd,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9oslgd/new_builder_pro_settings_meta/,1,New Builder Pro Settings Meta,"Today, Fortnite updated to version 6.1. In this update- it included very good settings to make building more customizable and easier for everybody. However, in this update— they added a feature where you no longer have to select the build piece to place it. 

I think this is absolutely terrible. Everything in this update was great except for this implementation. This is bad for the meta because of one core reason, and I really think it should be removed from the game.

1. Skill Gap. This is always brought up constantly because of Epic Games track record of trying to remove this. Before this update, there was a short time you had to hold the build piece before you’d place it (.15 seconds I think). This added a level of skill when it came to building- you had to get the hang of the timing and build accordingly. The timing of the build placing was the core of high level building on console. 

Ex. If I was trying to triple-layer ramp but I swapped too fast, the piece wouldn’t place because I didn’t wait the time. A skilled player would have the hang of this and know exactly when to stop holding the button and be able to do this task successfully.

Conclusion: I see a lot more people who I can tell are not experienced players building now because of this setting. I can see this in the strategies they try, their aim, and their game sense of what to do in a certain situation.

It’s become a hassle to deal with this players who have not spent the time to learn the core game mechanics and can now do a significant amount of damage to me.

(Counter-argument:)
I know this was added specifically to give us a fighting chance against PC players, but I don’t see this as the case. Not everybody who can build should be able to face PC players, only the most talented of us. We should have to go the extra mile to successfully fight PC players in building because of this. This in turn— increases the skill gap.",FortNiteBR

I’d love to be able to capture cool snipes and great moments leading up to the victory royale!

Up until last night we have never really had a bonding experience. Our typical gaming sessions end with him rage-quitting and me being frustrated and feeling helpless. He's not great at the game, I'm not great at the game, But at the end of the day I want to spend time with him, and if that's through video games then so be it. Last night we got our first duo victory. After the win he jumped up and hugged me tighter than he ever has before. I was overwhelmed with a huge sense of pride knowing that we had worked together to accomplish this common goal. I have been on cloud 9 all day and would like to thank Epic games for this bonding experience with my son. The feeling I had in the moment of victory is truly indescribable.

The nerf to 80/85 with 2.0x multiplier was a good nerf, not complaining there. This made the max damage with a pump be 160/170 respectively.

Getting max damage or a little less before the update was doable with good aim. However, with the pellet change, something is really off. It seems extremely difficult, even with really good aim, to get even CLOSE to max damage, let alone break 100. Some of my best shots that would get me 180-220 with the previous dmg, don't even break 100 for me with the current version.

Watch this clip.
https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightEnchantingSandstormBibleThump

If you put it in slow motion, you can see that every single pellet hits and the dmg number is yellow so he got a headshot. Lets assume the worst and figure that only 1 pellet hit his head. How is it that he only does 88 damage if the base damage for hitting every pellet is 80 yet we are assuming at least 1 pellet hit the head cause of the yellow damage? Something is seriously off.

I never understood why people complained about the shotgun spreads being too inconsistent before all these updates, cause now it ACTUALLY feels inconsistent.

Suggestion: Keep all shotgun damage the same, that's not the issue. The pellet spread is the issue, something isn't adding up.",FortNiteBR

We also cannot completely stop other teams from jumping on you immediately after a fight. However, by turning down the audio radius a tad it can help stop teams from finding you in the midst of battle. The way the game is right now, a lot of people run around or camp waiting for an audio que (gunfire, rockets, snipes) and then move into battle for an easy kill on a weak opponent who is distracted by somebody else. By making it harder to hear from long distances it will cut down on the number of instances that this occurs. What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Cut down the audio radius for long distances. May result in less third-partying.",FortNiteBR

For example: if you’re re on 7x 6y sens and the multiplier is 1.25, then the editing will still be at 7 6, which makes it a bit slow instead of using the building multiplier. I wanted to bring that up and see if it could be considered as a potential change/fix.

So they started by:

Modifying the Speed of Shopping Carts giving an unfair advantage

Drying up loot lake which also is unfair bcz they can walk on ground and run instead of just walking on water


Removing delay when opening chests which can be crutial at beginning of the game


Removing the Reloding animation which is a HUGE advantage. They can shoot until their bullets are down to 0 like the minigun witthout having to recharge

We released patch 6.10 and so far the feedback has been really positive overall! We included a handful of bug fixes and features the team hopes you are excited about. One such feature was “Touch control input now has smoothing enabled”, this feature was intended to make camera movement feel less jerky but caused an issue with sensitivity feeling off for many players. We have introduced a hotfix to disable this and players should no longer have any sensitivity issues. You may need to restart the application to take affect.

The mobile team has been working extremely hard to bring meaningful updates to the mobile platform. Patch 6.10 is the start of this process. THE INTERACTION BUG IS FIXED!!!  (sorry got excited, back to normal) I know many of you are still looking for answers to questions to a few other big points. Some of these questions are about 60 FPS and stats. I do not have an exact date on when a launch of some of these most desired requests will happen. I can say that a lot is in the works to bring a great Fortnite experience to mobile. Please continue to stay patient with us as we work towards this goal. 

I hope this update has brought some excitement to you all! So what is the best part of this update to you all, other than the interaction bug haha. Who is going to participate in the new tournament events? Let me know!

&amp;nbsp;

There’s currently a visual issue in the Event Tab in-game that’s causing North America to appear as your region in the bottom right of the screen regardless of your currently selected region. This is a visual issue only and you will be properly placed in the region you have selected once the event begins.

&amp;nbsp;

All times appearing in the Events tab will show the correct time related to the region you’re currently playing on. This means if you are playing on the EU region that you’ll see North America in the bottom right, but all times related to the event will still show the proper EU times.

&amp;nbsp;

But since I’m here, let’s take a look at the Event times for Alpha Tournament in all regions.

&amp;nbsp;

**NA** (Note: NAW &amp; NAE share the same tournament, but matchmaking will be by selected server region)

* 2300 - 0200 UTC
* 7 PM - 10 PM ET
* 4 PM - 7 PM PT

&amp;nbsp;

**EU**

* 1600 - 1900 UTC
* 6 PM - 9 PM CEST

&amp;nbsp;

**BR**

* 2200 - 0100 UTC
* 7 PM - 10 PM BRT

**ASIA**

* 1000 - 1300 UTC
* 7 PM - 10 PM JST

**OCE**

* 0600 - 0900 UTC
* 5 PM - 8 PM AEDT

We can’t wait to see you out there and hope you have a blast with the Alpha Tournament!

I've been playing fortnite since Season 2 and i must say it is a really nice game for free to play.I have been playing with my friends and i have 200+ wins with a very good % of winning rate.I consider myself a decent ps4 player.

Every Season was great and i have purchased all the battle passes so far , i really liked all the additions and changes they made so far but i cannot say the same for late Season 5 and the current Season 6.The game was based on building , positioning , fast reaction , aiming and some times luck. From Season 2 until now i can say that Epic games have reduced the skill gap as much as they can ! I feel like the game has changed and pure skill is not rewarded.What i mean is that the addition of buffed smg's , grappler gun , a variety of bombs and missiles and last the shadow stones made me want to quit and i will explain why.

SMG's were made in order to balance the game and make people use something else than shotguns. I can understand that . People are using them in order to spray like crazy though, they are destroying bases and structures so easy and is really annoying. However i can accept SMG changes they have a point and i could continue playing under these circumstances

Grappler Gun , the only reason i dislike Grappler Gun is that people who are not farming materials or are in a very bad position can get away . For example i find it really dissapointing when for a whole year i have been learning how to edit and build and farming materials and someone who is lazy can get away or even get advantage with grappler gun. However i can understand its usage and i can continue play under these circumstances 

Bombs and grenade launchers are an ok feature but they are plenty of them. Its like when i build at someone he has like 10 bombs . However i will explain later why i dont like it.

Last but not least.. SHADOW STONES . The worst feature ever added in Fortnite . Why? Because every game from the start of Season 6 people appear from nowhere ! Inside my base , inside a house that i might be looting , behind me ..every d**n game .. as i said i have 200+ wins and i really like the game. BUT i cannot stand shadow stones at all. I loved the addition of rift portals , the gravity stones .. but this thing.. no..

To conclude , Epic has made a great game . They are adding features and changing things daily . They are working hard for this game.i dont want to be negative . Although, all those additions that i  mentioned are there in order to reduce skill gap . There is playground mode for someone who cant build or cant shoot. There are plenty of ways to become decent player and enjoy this game as much as i used to . They only thing is that you have to train and work hard to become better as i and numerous players did . I was really bad at the beggining its normal.I feel like the game has become random and pure luck now and thats why i might quit .

Thanks for reading this , feel free to leave a comment so i can see your view of things . ",FortNiteBR

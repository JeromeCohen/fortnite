I feel that these point I make are valid and Epic does cater to the lower end skill spectrum of the game. Now my points..

You add an LMG with 100 rounds in a game that you are meant to build for cover, how do you build for cover when you have 2+ LMGs killing your builds before they’re finished building. 

You add weapon delays, so anyone who was a good editor and could make build plays by editing you royally fucked us in the ass. No more edit pumps, have to use tactical shotguns (which I don’t use btw)

You’ve made it so if two freaking pixels of your opponent are through your builds in a build off they just stroll right through your build and shoot you in the face. 

Assault rifle bloom is just terrible, if you don’t flick FSA you miss every shot, except for the lucky ones. 

All of which were never a problem until mid season 3. 
I’m not the only person who says this shit either, I hear about it daily from streamers. STREAMERS, the people who give free publicity to your game Epic. I know I’m a small fish in a large pond, but for fucks sake at least listen to the people who play the game daily and know what’s wrong with it and how to fix it.... 

End rant.. downvote away",FortNiteBR

I reaches tier 100 last season and have played at least 50 hours in this game. Before this solo win id only ever had 1 squad win, and i wasnt even alive for it. Ive reached second place in solos many times, but i had never managed to win until now. 

Normally in solos i come out with around 6 kills. For my win i had only 2 kills, and thats including the winning blow.  I hid as a bush for most of the match, but i didnt just hide. I attempted to snipe people while hiding. Thats how i got my first kill that game, managed to snipe someone who thought they were safe.  

In the last 2 circles there was 6 of us left, all at the prison near moisty. I simply hid as my bush out in the open, while everyone else built their towers and fought eachother. Every now and then i took pot shots, trying to get stealth kills. Best i did was 100 damage with my sniper, but it only took down shields. 

By the final circle it was just me and 2 others.  I watched from a distance as i watched these 2 in an epic build off.  The winner of the two used an RPG to destroy the bottom of their structure and caused the other to fall to their death.  He then went around looking for me by rocketing all the nearby structures.  He was on top of the nearby mountain, while i was on the ground level in the open. I sneaked my way up to him, only for him to notice me at the end.  He started spamming rockets at me but none hit. 

I finish climbing up the stairs to the mountain, he keeps firing rockets.  I get to the too, pull out my trusty tri-burst AR.  And then all 3 of my bullets hit him in the head, his rocket zooming past me.  He falls, loot everywhere.  Ive won.  I was so surprised that i almost didnt emote in time.

Even though the game is fun, it is extremely broken. A good comparison to Fortnite would be MW2. The game is so much fun but has many issues which limit a competitive scene. Like MW2 the game receives a lot of love and people are afraid to hate it or when they do, they just get shot down by sheep to this game. This mentality hides the issues which plague this game. Two issues I can point out are lack of competitive game modes and RNG. The First is pretty obvious. Its next to impossible to find a game that has a competitive scene without a competitive mode for a normal player to play. Call of duty had league play and CSGO has mm. Although Call of Duty is currently dead, It used to thrive during the BO2 era and League Play was one of those reasons. A mode where you’re ranked among other similar skill players is necessary in any game. I understand that some people don't care about a competitive scene in this game, but others including me want to play this game in competitive mode. The second issue which ruins a competitive scene is RNG. This issue is hard to fix without reworking the game, but I think EPIC should keep  casual game modes like they have right now and add ranked game modes with changes to the core game which makes the game more reliant on skill. First before I say what changes I think should be made to the competitive scene, I will like to explain the issue of RNG to people who don't understand it. RNG or random number generator is a bit of code in the game which decides all the random aspects to the game. These include what's in your chest, what weapons spawns, supply drops, storm place, etc. RNG should never be the reason someone dies. I remember i was watching Ninja at the start of the game got dropped by a no skin with a scar and ninja had a common pistol. Ninja looted half of L's in tilted and the no skin looted one room. Everyone was calling Ninja trash and overrated because he died. He didnt die because he was bad. He died because someone had better loot because they got LUCKY. They looted one room and got a scar and ninja looted three rooms and got a common pistol. People mistake luck for skill and called him terrible. Imagine if that was a competitive game with money on the line and the best player goes down at the start of the game because of a factor they can't control. I understand that in third-party competitive services play multiple games to try to eliminate this issue, but the issue still remains. Now that I have explained the issue I will go ever what changes I know should happen.
Add a competitive mode: Like I said, it's a way for people be able to test out their skills in a ranked environment and get placed in a league or Rank similar to csgo. If EPIC doesn't make this change, I hope a third party like Faceit or ESEA takes over. However, these services require a small payment and some people aren't able to play. 
Note: All the following changes I think should be made in the hopefully added ranked game mode. 

Removing the RPG: The RPG is the best gun in the game. The reason why is you doesn't actually have to aim at a person to hit them. You could miss by like two feet and the splash will tag them down. The gun takes very little skill but is high reward. It is because of this the RPG has no place in a competitive scene. 

Removing Silenced SMG, Minigun, LMG, and pistol: These Guns are all very bad. Like terrible to get. All they do is add more weapons so more RNG is in the game. There actually pointless. 
	
	Removing Loot Lamas: Again, it's lucky you find one and gives an advantage based of RNG. 

Increasing the amount of mats you get by 50%: This is just to speed up the game and keep it from being slow and boring.

Removing Med Pack and having Bandages be able to heal up to 100: No one likes 75 health, and the only way to get 100 back is to get lucky and get  a med pack. Thats RNG. 

Increase Chance of getting Minis, Big Shield, Chug, and Slurp by 15%: Shields are  great place for RNG. If someone has full health and full shield and you have 100 health 50 shield, you are automatically at a disadvantage because some got lucky and got shields and you didn't.   

Removing the All the craters and moon rocks: The craters are trash place to land and going dusty divoit is suicide. The moon rocks give one side a advantage because they can jump 500 feet in the air. They just aren't fit for a competitive scene.  

Shorting Tilted Towers: Removing Fish Brick, L’s, Garge, Trump, Paper Stand, and Grocery. So many people die at tilted and it makes the mid game long and boring. Shorting it will mean less players will land at tilted towers.

Removing the common and green AR and Burst: In H1Z1, there was only one gun. The M4. No Upper tier. Just the plain M4. Any gun fight you got in it would be even. It was more reliant on skill. I think the two lower tiers of AR’s add unescarry RNG to the game. 

	Increase chance to get Scars and Grenade launchers: To extremely powerful guns are hidden away from players through RNG. Increase the chance to get them will mean more players will have access to these weapons and even out the playing field. 

That's all the changes I recommend for a ranked mode. If you have any leave a comment.

On the 7th of march, I got an e-mail in my inbox from Epic Games, thanking me for my €149,99 purchase of some version of StW. Since this purchase wasn't made by me I was very surprised. The first thing I did was change my password. When I logged in right after, I had some new people in my friends list with French names who I immediately removed.


The purchase was made through PayPal. I hade used PayPal on Fortnite before to purchase the battlepass, and without me knowing, Epic Games stored my PayPal information on their servers which allowed the hacker to make the purchase without any blockade.


When I sent a ticket to Epic, they responded quite quickly (~1 week) saying my request for a refund had been accepted. They also stated that the money would be transferred back within 3 weeks. 3 weeks passed, and I had not received a refund yet. I e-mailed them again, asking if they could try to make the refund again. Sadly, I have not received any answer to that message yet, although it's been over a month since I sent it and I have no clue what to do now. I hope someone at Epic sees this to help me out.


**TL;DR:**
My account got hacked, hacker spent €149,99 on my account, Epic seems to ignore me.

My little brother recently bought the Battle Pass, but since our mother doesn't want him to play all that much, he's allowed about half an hour a day, and about 1 on weekends. That's why he came up with a ""plan"" to level up his Battle Pass faster. 

He starts a game of Battle Royale on his Console and puts Rubberband on his controller, so his character would walk continuosly. Every few minutes he checks the game, if he died or not, and if he did he starts a new round. But this strategy raised a few questions for me.

Is going AFK in Battle Royale a bannable offense? I know that going AFK in STW is a huge problem \(Leechers etc.\), but in BR you're not really harming anyone, and you're not abusing bugs or exploits are you?

I am concerned about this, because he's only 11 years old, and he loves the game so much, he bought Season 3 and 4 Battlepasses as soon as he could afford them. I think he would be pretty upset, if one day he woke up and found out he got banned for XP\-Farming. 

So I would like to ask the Reddit Community if there is any official Statement from Epic, whether or not going AFK is a bannable offense, so I can warn him in advance.

Thanks in advance!",FortNiteBR

You were on my immediate team, I saw you in the lobby and we emoted together. My heart sank. 

You followed me off the battle bus to the same location; I believe we visited shifty shafts and we looted together. We travelled long and far just to reach the circle. 

We built our base together, we murdered a few guys until we stood on top of our base, and carelessly began to dance. 

It was you who got shot. Not me, you. I was distressed, how can I sit and watch my friend die right now?

I play on mobile, the controls are touch screen based and so I clicked the revive button. Nothing happened. I clicked again, and instead of reviving, it fired a shot. This didn’t hurt you of course, but it hurt me. Emotionally. It really did. 

I moved around you to see if this bug was happening due to the space I was stood in, however the game just wouldn’t let me revive you. Other players nearby were too busy defending us but little did they know I was watching you, my only friend, bleed to death right in front of me. I’m sorry.

Maybe it will come back this halloween but maybe not since everyone seems to consider it an OG skin and that it wouldn't be fair to people who played the game back then.

Personally I would like to see the return of the Red Knight and the Love Ranger. I don't think that the Red Knight will ever come back because it is part of the Fort Knight's set and it wouldn't make sense to have it return in S4 with the cinema theme, but a man can dream. 

As for the Love Ranger I'll probably have to wait till next Valentine's day but I just really like the wings. 

Downloaded the game in mid-October and played a bit during S2 but I started playing a lot during the beginning of S3 right before the Valentine's skins came out. I've spent maybe 60 bucks on the game total. So I guess I'm an older player but not really. 

I kind of get the OG aspect of skins but at the same time I don't. Like if you have Skull Trooper or Red Knight then you probably have Renegade Raider or the Black Knight, which had to be earned and not bought. I do agree seeing a bunch of Skull Troopers and Red Knights running around would ruin the skin for people that have had it from the beginning though. Probably best to keep them vaulted.",FortNiteBR

Surely enough, 100 USD had been stolen from my account. I INSTANTLY cancelled my card and requested a new one. After setting up an investigation with my Bank, I decided to check my account purchase history in Fortnite, apparently whoever hacked the account has been attempting to buy Limited Editions, Vbucks... Anything they can over the last month!

Proof: https://imgur.com/eObtk7O

For the past few months I've been living on an extremely tight budget, so you can see that they failed to make transactions during March due to insufficient funds. But more recently, they succeeded after i received some pay! I'm scared nobody will believe me, but it wouldn't make sense for me to buy everything in the game, and then try to buy more! Why would I do that?! Why would anyone do that?! I've never given my password to anyone or any website claiming to distribute ""Free V-Bucks"" either.

I'm thinking that it's because I also use the same password on Patreon, which was compromised not so long ago. I can't be sure but it's the only thing that makes sense.

Epic PLEASE remove the ""Remember credit card details"" option from your in-game store, I've read so many other posts today from other people who have been hacked the same way. I have now set up 2 factor authentication so that this never happens to me again.

I beg you to help me. I can't even afford gas after this tragedy and I need help. please. :(",FortNiteBR

Trading could fill in this problem and leave all players happy and getting the items they couldn't get before. Epic could make a market off this since we can use vbucks as

Pros: * Trade for rare items (like S2 battle pass items or S1 items) in exchange for other skins or vbucks.

Doesn't ruin the rarity or make the item too common but gives players a chance to get their favorite skins/emotes from other players.

Trade legendaries skins for legendaries skins (yeah Epic is implementing a refund system for items purchased within 30 days, but you can only refund 3 items max only and this can be good for legendary skins you don't want that you brought longer than 30 days ago)

Uses vbucks as currency so it benefits Epic too.

Cons:

Leaves players open to get scammed like in STW.

Creates a trading market. If you played games like CS:GO, this can be a good and bad thing.

Trading enables gambling, gambling enables players to risk losing skins they've earned wihout getting it back.",FortNiteBR

Someone recently posted spoilers for the rest of season 4 and even some of season 5(which I will not be linking to). It made me think about the state of the game and how it's going to continue with people ruining surprises like this. 

As far as I can tell, no one benefits from it:

* The readers lose interest in the game, since they already know what is going to happen.

* The poster will lose his account after getting some attention, as was the case for /u/InternetAdam(yes, I know he deleted it, but he still lost all that karma).

* The ones who leak the information [will get sued,](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Y6COcCSxUhcJ:https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2018/05/08/carys-epic-games-sues-raleigh-contractor-over.html+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) which is already happening to InternetAdam's source(credit to /u/SuperSensonic for finding this cached article).  

Now I personally hate spoilers, and I know for sure the devs do too. That's why I have some suggestions to lower the amount of spoilers:

* Mods, please add a rule/rules that won't allow anyone to post season spoilers on the subreddit. If someone does, make the punishment a ban. I know you guys/gals are great about managing this community, so I doubt this would be hard at all.

* Devs, you obviously have ways of discovering the leaks, and have been doing a fantastic job at taking action against them. My only suggestion is to do some research into the people you decide to tell these secrets to, and make sure they're trustworthy enough to keep it to themselves. Otherwise, keep up what you're doing. Hearing anything about legal action will sway people from spoiling(but I'm sure you already know that).

That's my opinion on the whole issue. What do you guys think? Should season spoilers should be removed from the subreddit or not? If you don't think they should, I would be happy to know why.

I’ve had this game for about three months now, but rarely play it now because of one thing:

I never get any closer to winning.

I’m always 53rd or-so to die, and whenever I should have the upper hand (built above and dropped down on them, shotgun from around the corner, ect) I also die, even to no skins.

I’m really sick of it. Squads is worse, and I’ve never gotten more than one kill in any matches (and those kills were stolen)

I’m high-skilled in games like Overwatch, TF2, and other games, why not Fortnite?

The calculator then tells you how many weeks you have left before you hit tier 100 based on that information. It currently factors in weekly challenge completions, daily completions, and straight leveling without challenges, as unrealistic as that is. Some of the variables like XP bonuses from challenges that add into leveling I haven't gotten to yet because that adds a fair bit of complexity, but maybe if this gets enough traction/requests I'll put it in later.

I've tested it on PC and Android phones, but it's a webpage so it shouldn't have major issues based on platform. It also uses dialogue boxes for input/output messages, so make sure those are allowed in your browser.

This is my first time using GitHub as well as JavaScript/HTML for anything, so the presentation is definitely shoddy but I plan on working on that (yes, the dialogue boxes are messy as hell). As I said, I put a whole lot of time into this, most of which was maddening due to my inexperience with the methods used and things that should work but totally didn't (if you've done any programming, you know that feeling). I'm glad to make improvements based on feedback and will be peeking in to check on things periodically, but I'm probably going to need a bit of a break to decompress before tackling larger requests/issues that arise (unless it totally doesn't work, then I'll probably get on it quicker). 

If anyone has more experience with JS or HTML and can give some tips to clean up the user experience, I'd be glad to hear them.

Thanks for using it if you do, and feel free to comment. Hopefully this gets some attention, as I'm posting it at a bad time of the day.",FortNiteBR

Then, while imprisoned, he somehow got Teknique(Or maybe the character we're going to unlock from the Blockbuster challenge) to start building some sort of beacon at the Snobby Shores mountainside hideout. We can say it's either Teknique or the hidden character due to a purple insignia, and the only character who would use purple currently is Teknique(or the hidden one, which we don't know the colors of). After the beacon was built, it called upon a meteor shower that resulted in the prison being destroyed, thus freeing Omega. The second blockbuster loading screen shows Omega escaping the prison while it is still ablaze, saying ""I will reclaim my power. I will gather my allies. I will have my vengeance.""

Perhaps Omega is saying that he will gather his armor(level ups), get his powerful villain buddies(maybe the blockbuster character?) and have revenge... Or, by ""Gather my allies"" he means he'll use some sort of factory to create a bunch of robots like the new skins that just dropped.

So i sent him a msg after the game telling him that i will upload that game on reddit so that everyone can see what stupid people do ( they think its funny ) so i hope that you can repport this type of shitty players ... this thing .. needs to stop .. and we can make it stop if we  repported every single one who does such a thing like that ( usually you get band for killing your teammates ) .

The more I watch, the more I think this would be an viable and important role in competitive Fortnite. I haven't watched many PC scrims, but it seems that having a CQC shotgun player who primarily plays the low ground while engaging enemies might be an effective role. 

Anyone that's play anything competitive knows how important roles are and Sypher and Nick showed that perfectly yesterday. Nick's aggressive Grounder role meshed perfectly with Sypher's snipes and callouts. I honestly feel like this could be a big role in 4v4's when the time comes. With Fortnite being so new, roles will develop, evolve, and change. 

The first thing that comes to mind for with roles;
Grounder: Plays low ground in engagement. Primarily a shotgun player. 
Flyer: The most aggressive player on the team. Builds up on players and their inventory is more weapon dominant.
Support: Cover's the flyer and supports with AR fire and splodes. 
Sniper: Self explanatory. 

Feel free to chime in and if you like the term ""Grounder,"" feel free to start using it and give it some juice :)",FortNiteBR

I play only 1 hour a day (not even every day) and I am already at level 50. 

So yeah, with this method the full Omega armor isn't exclusive to the ""no lives"", this is an example of how in this world, money can buy you almost anything.

PS: Guess the only thing you need to put effort on would be completing the 7 weekly challenges to get the exclusive skin, but then again, that's nothing compared to having to level up to 80.

If your sensitivity is under the default value, it will reset itself to 0.26. It will not affect you if you have a sensitivity over that number.


The sensitivity value reset wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the sensitivity slider system itself is broken aswell. If you put your sensitivity to, let's say, 0.05, you can still see that you have some space to move. Moving the slider further to the left if it's still at 0.05 will result in a LOWER sensitivity and vice versa. The game only shows you the value up to the 2nd decimal figure, when it really goes from 0.XX to 0.XXXXXXXXXX depending on where you place your slider. The greatest fix to this problem would be to make us able to just put in numbers instead of fucking around with some slider.

So yeah, please fix it before pushing out the hardest challenge in the entire game.",FortNiteBR

I know i'm going to get super downvoted for this but I just want a gamemode where getting kills actually require skill and proper aiming and a gamemode where I use more than a selection of 2 guns since shotguns just cover both short and medium range and then snipers cover long ranges.

I would actually use smg's and pistols since they're short range and fights would be more dependent on a persons skill than just ""This person has a shotgun therefore they win""

This post kind of turned into a rant against shotguns but I still want a gamemode where shotguns don't exist just to see what happens.",FortNiteBR

Dont get me wrong when I first saw season 4 I was soo hyped but then taking a second look I am far more disspointed. Now they aernt all bad like omega, blue guy and valor. These skins are nice but the others like zoey, spray paint and not 1 nononono but 2 soldier skins. Like really? do we REALLY need 2 soldier skins? plus a candy girl skin that is by far the ugliest skin in the entire game? Season 3 had me lookin forward to dark voyager, rust lord and special ops. But this season it is just pure laziness.",FortNiteBR

I have been wrongfully banned for fraud a few days ago. I've tried to contact Epic but they said they couldn't unban me.

I spent around 100€ in the game, and I'm banned for nothing, what could have caused this? And if Epic sees my message, could we get in touch in PM over Reddit to clarify this ban?

Thank you a lot

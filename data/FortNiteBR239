TL;DR SHORT VERSION:

1) When playing cross platform, are you more likely to play with other crossplatform players than not? (see expanded version for detail)

2) When playing xbox - Ps4 or Console-Mobile, are you STILL entered into the PC cross platform lobbies?

EXPANDED VERSION

1) So, my PC players joins my Ps4 lobby, I press play squads and match making beings, does Fortnite prioritise other cross platform players before 'dumping' in PC players after x amount of time, just to get the game going, or will it just try and fill the lobby with whatever comes first, irrespective of whether other cross platform parties are available?

2) If I play on my xbox and join my Ps4 friend, it is obviously still cross platform, but both are console versions of the game, so will this place us with Mobile, PC or Switch players? or some combination? Or JUST console players, irrespective of xbox or Ps4?

Thank you very much for the help",FortNiteBR

I bought the battle pass just so I can pretend to be good. And I’m tier 36 only because I do all te easy challenges. I only knocked out about 3 or 4 of the “hard challenges”. Anyway, back to the point.

Me and my cousin have started playing Fortnite alot, and last night we were playing a lot of duos. My cousin said she had to go real quick and she will be right back. So I waited and talked with my sister, and I ended up on the floor for some reason. I had accidentally started a game.

So I’m in duos with some random guy by accident. I thought it would be unfair to leave him so I decided to stay and play the rest of the game. He died about five minutes in.

My teamate ended up landing in Titled (he landed before I realized we were playing. I landed in Loot Lake and had no trouble. I got some pretty not good guns (a common AR and a green pump) and I headed in. I tried to knock out some people with a Hunting Rifle but no luck. I did get a really strategic hit on one dude so I was feeling pretty good about that. I made a joke along the lines of “what if I win my first duos match alone hamargj”.

Little did I know . . . 

I ended up making it to the final four while letting the fight happen and sneaking around. I found a purple LMG so I was feeling pretty damn lucky. I saw a person running through the trees and I got a hit on him. Somehow we suddenly made it to the Top 2. He was running at me and was building a fort high above my simple little “stair-floor-wall” contraption. I was shooting at him and he was building.

He got up to the final part, and I shot the hell out of him with my LMG when he shot a huge rocket at me.

I killed him and he destroyed my structure. 

I was pretty ecstatic.

At the start of season 5, half of the map was transformed into a sandy desert filled with cacti and tumble weed. In the post, I will be explaining my reasons to choose the dunes over he dumps. 

Farming

Materials are a massive part of what makes fortnite unique when compared to other games  in the battle royale jonra along with the cartoon style graphics and good weapon and location design.  Farming is better in the desert because of cacti as they are quick to destroy and provide around 35 wood per cactus,  that and the fact that there are a lot of them makes for a substantial source of wood.

Points Of Interest 

In the desert, there are tons of places to land , all with decent loot. Obviously,  there's paradise palms and the new race track but there are some others such as the village behind the hill that has great loot or the other car scrapyard that t provides a lot of metal reasonably quickly and that can certainly come in handy when building a Base in the endgame.


Fights

To win at fortnite, you have to be the last player, squad or duo alive and this always results in killing other players , I come out of the desert at 4 - 5 kills but if you land at the palms or the truck, you can probably come out at around 7+ kills. Thanks to the cacti, fights will be quite exiting as if you are a good builder or trying to improve, there will be other people there for you to kill.

Conclusion

First of all, thank you for reading and secondly, epic better not nerf the cacti as they provide so much wood. Also, I recommend the scrapyard for duos and solos but not squads as there isn't enough loot.

In 2015 I complete my Visual Arts course at the university, and as a final work, I created a series of photographs with a character I created. Almost 3 years later today, I'm addicted to Fortnite and decided to create a skin based on this character from my work. I made a version in Photoshop and below you can see how it turn up and also some of the photos I created!

I hope you like it, and let me know in the comments, would you play with this skin?

I know he's changed a bit since moving away from the G502 but I had that mouse when he did so I figured I'd bind the way he did too.

Anyway, I'm starting to think I just can't do it the way he did.  I simply can't move my fingers fast enough.  I must be missing something crucial.

There are two buttons on the side of the mouse.  Mouse4 is under your thumb (ramp) and Mouse3 is just in front of that (wall) - then there's the ""side click"" of the scroll wheel to the left (floor) and to the right (pyramid).

Ramping up, I need to do the following clicks: M4 (ramp selected) &gt; left click to place &gt; M3 (wall in front of the ramp selected) &gt; left click to place &gt; left scroll click (floor underneath selected) &gt; left click to place &gt; repeat.

That's 6 clicks to get one section of the 3-layer down.  
And I'm not saying 3-layer is the best or anything.  It's just an example of a layered build that requires different selections.

Now... in reality, when I'm actually trying to do this in-game, I can't do it rapid-fire the way I see others do it.  It's just not smooth.  

Are they holding left-click to turbo build the whole time and only clicking the different build selections as they go?  If I try to do that I wind up with walls and ramps in all sorts of places.  Like I'll put the wall in my path instead of in front of the ramp as I'm going up, so I'm blocked.  Is it just timing?

Heck, even if I try to bind things to the keyboard like on Q, E, or whatever, I can't get the rhythm of building different types of pieces, switching between them quickly as you place them down.

What's the trick? :(",FortNiteBR

This post may come off as hostile but it’s not. These are facts. I will leave links below.

Since 2 weeks after season 5 started we have seen a massive spike in viewership for Fortnite. Every single streamers numbers are down SIGNIFICANTLY. not baby numbers, we are talking 25-50%. What’s worse? Fortnite’s viewership actually peaked in June at 1.5m viewers with 126m hours watched. This month we are looking at 600k viewers roughly, and only 55m hours watched, which is close to the numbers we had around January of this year. We need to quit saying Fortnite is growing. Sure more people log into the game, but hours played, watched, and spent interacting with the game via Reddit, Twitter, etc.. are dropping significantly. Again, not small numbers, but in large chunks. This is by no means an attack, but something we need to be aware of. Fortnite is by no means dying, but we are over the hump and on the downhill slide. Side note, WoW doubled Fortnite viewers last night. All links to raw data can be found below.

Here is my opinion and I am tired of hearing “just trust epic” because we saw what happened with Paragon. Epic has to get back to the roots and maintain its core at this point. Catering to the casuals is a bad move with CoD and Battlefield coming out in the very near future. They are casual for a reason, and it’s because they move games too often to get good at one. The meta has absolutely ruined this game. I am sorry if you like it, but twitch viewers which represents 40x what this sub represents hates it as shown with data. Sure go ahead and downvote all you want but that is a fact. Streamers don’t even enjoy streaming it anymore. This game was a great at one point, but we have gone so far off what this game used to be, that it’s losing its identity and is giving other games a time to shine. People need to quit believing the “Fortnite can’t be stopped, and continues to grow” lie and read data that’s as close to in game data as possible. Sure we don’t have real in game numbers, but you can look up how many people are watching, tweeting about, liking instagram posts, and just interacting with the game in general to get a good idea. None of these portray a good future if Epic continues down this path.

To be honest it is more a laser weapon because you can hit someone point blank where the pellets are hitting his head but you crosshair was not aimed like a laser at his head, and do only 6/8/9 damage.

This happens a lot with the pump and tactical and make it so that it is very annoying to the point of being frustrating.

You can also laser hitscan someone on his head, and all the pellets that did not hit his head are still being headshot multiplied.

The game went as usual with me hiding 90% of the game until it was me and 2 other people left. We were on the top left part of the map where the houses just south of haunted hills are now. The two no skins fought hard and one of them ended up on top. I knew this was my time to shine. I came in by surprise and got on top of him and threw the boogie bomb down (now this was when you could shoot someone while they were dancing and they would still have to dance for the full 5 seconds) and I watched him take each shot from my purple tactical shotgun to the face.

Stop asking,"I have come across no less than four posts in the past 20 minutes alone asking ""When is the update coming?""

The answer is not today. The update has a small chance of coming tomorrow, but it will most likely be the day after tomorrow on August 16th before 12:00 P.M eastern time.

**This update will include:**

* Rail sniper (confirmed)

* Fixing the back bling/cape physics (speculation)

* Batch #6 of the weekly challenges (if it comes out August 16th)

* Other unknown features and unimportant things like fixing bugs people didn't realize were even in the game

It will most likely be the version 5.3 update. Size can be anywhere from a few MB (most likely) to 1 GB, but since there was no word or ""hype"" for epic it will probably be a smaller update and take under 5 minutes to complete. Or it could just be hotfixes and not require any time at all! Also, the Steady Storm limited time mode is going to be removed either shortly before or with the update.

Wall - G5 (will stay the same)

Ramp - G4 (will stay the same)

Floor - Sniper (I sometimes click it when I don’t want to)

Pyramid - Left Alt (not really sure about this)

I tried using the Left Scroll Click for pyramid, but I would keep hitting my other finger on the right click.

I know they will take getting used to no matter what though. But since I’m hitting the Sniper button (floor) sometimes when I’m tryna hit Wall (G5) or Ramp (G5), is that something that will stop happening with time?

I did everything the game has to offer, completed very battle pass, got full omega last season etc. I played every day the last half year. As you may or may not know, there currently is a bug for a few people including me where the grenade challenge of this week will not register, it just stays at 0/300. I got at least 20-30 grenade kills since the challenges went live, i tried clingers and stink bombs with no effect either. I just realized i havent touched fortnite once the whole weekend, and its because of the challenge. Im kind of a weird guy. i am a completionist. This challenge is the only one im missing and i cant do it. You can say now that its not so bad, that it isnt a core mechanic of the game but every time i look at my challenge i lose every motivation and desire to further play this game. I will not get the roadtrip skin, i am five stars behind in my battlepass (again, thats no dealbreaker, but i didnt missed a single daily challenge the last half year.) Unfortunately, only a few people are affected by this bug so it doesnt get much attention on here. So please, EPIC, i love you and your game but please understand how this destroys the game for me, even if you cant feel it like i do. Just wanted to get this off my chest.

And even when I notice that someone has it before they get a chance to shoot at me, I end up playing so cautiously so as to not get one-shotted that it takes longer than any other shotgun battle ever would usually. 

I honestly don't think that this is the gun that we needed to counter the SMG spam meta and it just further proves how EPIC seems to be trying their hardest to diminish the skill-gap by rewarding less-skilled players with powerful weapons that take very little skill to use.

I literally cannot play this without the majority of my team from being south of the border. 

I ain't knocking the people that live there, they cannot help it, but Epic can. There is no reason people that far south should be on an NA East server. I myself live in Michigan and have a 50-60ish ping on the NA Easter servers, so I cannot imagine what it's like for them. Not only that, the obvious language barrier it creates. As I said, I live in Michigan and have for 30+ years. I don't speak Spanish, nor did I ever plan on learning so. I've self taught myself to learn simple Spanish words, but outside of that, I'm clueless as to what they're saying.

9/10 games I play in squads, my 3 teammates are Mexican. This is Gears 3 all over again, another game developed by Epic. That is probably my most played game of all time, and I straight up quit it. Another Epic game, that couldn't keep regions seperate. At that game's end cycle, it was filled with lag and a massive language barrier after being a solid game, because the people that live down south had no server to play so the game migrated them to any ol' server they could fit on.

Please Epic, give our southern brothers/sisters a server of their own. I highly doubt they enjoy playing with English speakers or on a server where there ping is over 100. I shouldn't have to have 3 friends on at the same time to enjoy squads. At this point, this is unacceptable. 

That's a 2,000 mile difference FYI, that is not good for anyone involved.

Who are you gonna kill with that? The regular SMGs are just superior in every way and you would always pick that up over the Silenced SMG. I understand that the Silenced SMG was a laser and people would pick it up over ARs but this nerf defeats the purpose of it, it was supposed to be a close ranged weapon that can be used far ranged if need-be. The better nerf would be decreasing the base-accuracy of the weapon so that it doesn't laser and hip-firing also wouldn't be the best option.

Maybe 25v25 is pvp with 50 zombies CP on the map????? 
Main inconvenience would be giving away positions while fighting CP and CP destroying buildings while fighting. Every time the circle shrinks 15 less zombies are spawned in circle (this way there are always zombies but not too many relative to circle size).
Ex. 50 in first circle, 35 in second, 20 in third, etc

The game has changed a lot since I started in October and the Fortnite I am referring to is one where the midgame to late game was exciting and and action was constant. There was just around 9 weapons I think, one sort of shield potion, and most importantly, very few points-of-interest.

POI's are fun and exciting. Whether it's throughout the season when they are updated, like Dusty Depot/Divot or new ones like Paradise Palms and Tilted Towers. The only downside to new POI's is it spreads everyone out, or focuses them in, tends to do both, which is not good. Having both of these effects at once results in a mid game (usually from start of second circle to mid third) that is slow and dull. I'll try and break down why:

1. Big POI's like Tilted Towers brings a whole lot of people into one relatively close-knit area. This makes for a really exciting early game, nothing wrong with, right? Correct, in a way, but I'll talk about why later. Anyways, early game at Tilted is fun because it is big and different from the rest of the map and attracts everyone there. Top Twitch streamers like Ninja and Daequan at the time had realized this and knew that if they landed at Tilted, they could break some Solo kill records.

Has anyone noticed that no one has gotten anywhere *near* the solo records since last season? Every season it gets harder and harder because of the amount of new areas. Getting kills is no difficult task, seeking out players to kill midgame is something entirely different.

2. Lots of smaller POI's contribute to the lack of finding players in the mid game as well. Having smaller areas allows for players to take a less aggressive style of play and survive past the beginning is a good thing for new/younger players.

Back in the day, there were these things called ""map rotations"" or ""rotations"". These were used after exiting your landing spot and searching for players after they have exited theirs. You look at the map, then look at the storm, and finally predict the possible rotations of players heading towards the circle and into the nearest POI. But because there are so many smaller POI's spread over the map, it's harder to predict where players will be and will also cause them to be further spread out.

Conclusion: In summary, there is no perfect scenario. Having more points of interest keeps the game fresh and enjoyable while also decreasing the amount of action and kills. I think most would agree that the second option is preferable but to each his own. The only solution to the dead mid game is Blitz. Having the circles close in fast and the first one already beginning is super clever and fun and exciting. That's my two cents, what do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Ive been playing Fortnite since season 3 , 1 of the biggest struggles I had when first starting like most others is building in fights. I would find myself in jumping shotgun fights a lot and wouldn’t remember to build until I died . I struggled with this all season , I was very inconsistent in my building. Sometimes I would build and sometimes I wouldn’t. I tried many different strategies like practicing building in 50v50 but when it came down to a fight I simply just wouldn’t build. Until i started this strat........ 

How I fixed my issue and got in the habit of building immediately in a fight is a good story. I literally would land in Wailing Woods every game farm up till 999 would and not pick up a single weapon. Yes you read that correctly, NOT PICK UP A SINGLE WEAPON. My sole purpose in the match was to outbuild any opponents that pushed me to stay alive. Not having any weapons I was forced to build every single time An opponent saw me . I would build up than drop down and run every fight. Id seriously get to top 25 pretty consistently which is funny lol .... After several games of doing this it fixed my issue of not building , this strategy alone got me into the habit of building every single fight now and I thought this would help if shared :)

Let me know if this strategy works for you :) Remember JUST BUILD. ",FortNiteBR

So I've come to the conclusion that after you lose a match whether it be solo, duo, or squads. 

Its actually quite annoying having to click 'leave match', loading screen, back to the lobby, que up, loading screen, join game, wait for it to fill up, bus ride, jump, land.... Die (not all the time). 

*But this takes minimum 5-7min. Maximum 10min.*

I would love to have a dedicated tab after a death!  'try again?'

Once clicked, It would automatically que up while spectating the enemy who took you out. That's fine with me! That means more games I can fit in.

I know it's something minimal and not that important. But I wana play right after being killed. I actually tend to not play a next match because I know it's gonna be a while until I'm in the next game.

When the circle moves its at random so if its far away from you you kinda have to hope that you can both avoid dying from enemies spraying at you and avoid the storm even touching you in the slightest. Yeah its so that people on mountains dont basically win just due to high ground, but getting control of the mountain, predicting the circle will close on the mounting, and holding it down has some skill, getting lucky due to having the circle be next to you when it moves is not. I think it would be better if the storm had more time when it moves so if youre on the opposite end of the circle and enemies are shooting you, you at least have more than .1 second to build and get away from the storm",FortNiteBR

The semi auto assault rifle is , in a way, an unusual combination of the burst assault rifle and the normal assault rifle. In my opinion , the weapon should have a mediocre fire rate, a 30 round ammunition capacity with high damage and heavy recoil, loud noise and relatively slower reloads . I think the gun is used best if you have good aim and can land shots accurately .Also , I intend for the weapon to be the most accurate assault rifle . Overall, I think the weapon would be good to the game as it would be a mediator between the snipers and the assault rifles.

**Damage** 

The table below lists the weapons statistics.

||Common|Uncommon|Rare|||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Headshot |66|68|70|74|78|
|Bodyshot|33|34|35|37|39|
|Fire rate (per second)|1.7|1.7|1.7|1.8|1.8|

**Conclusion**

In the case of this weapons implementation, I can see it being used by most players .  Now, I haven't really covered the aesthetics so I will proceed to do so now . A G36C  would be the perfect fit for the epic and legendary and for the common to rare , I think that the hunter killer from save the world would do the job just fine.",FortNiteBR

I don't think that games have any way to recognize these devices because they just map the controller controls to the keyboard.

I want to talk about performance and how the game becomes worse every patch - I know it's a meme already, and pretty much everyone who plays that game for a while know well that every patch there are new drop in performance and bunch of new bugs.  


# Performance:

So as the title says - last time for me when I had a high and stable fps was patch 4.2. I was playing at all EPIC settings with 100+ fps always. Right now I play at all low settings with unstable fps and hard fps drops every few minutes on my GTX 1080 Ti. And I'm not alone with that - all of my friends have similar problems, and also EPIC forums have tons of topics about that - just a small compilation of topics about performance issues (it took 5 seconds to find those):

https://i.redd.it/fgytkp2e2wf11.png

So how can it be that performance completely scruwed by the game developers themselves in one patch and never fixed?  


I dunno what else to say about performance rly - it's just became poor in one moment for me, while just a patch before everything was fine, and I'm waiting few monts already if they'll ever fix it. I'm reading every patch note's performance section and expecting to see FPS drops fix, but all I see is: ""shopping carts isssue fixed"" - 3 patches it row it fixed, and still laggy when I use one.  


# Sound:

In patch 4.4 they did that:

https://i.redd.it/e751nnpx3wf11.png

After those changes I can't normaly play inside of buildings, especially building with a few floors - simply because sound became very unclear: you can hear all the enemies around you in a pretty big area, but you hardly can tell where exactly any of them. 

Well the vertical sound is just the worse right now, when you at the middle of a high buiding you can't really tell if the enemy is above you or under...  


Those sound changes affected high popularity areas and intense building fight the most - because every time you lost your target in some multifloor building - good luck finding it. You can hear hes somewhere right next to you, but you can spend like 30 seconds to figure out where exactly he is.  


Also, it's not just me, but every streamer that I see and every friend of mine said the sound is screwed right now.  


If you ever dropped to tilted towers I guess you feel it too.  


So what is the point of that topic? Well, I just want ECIC to stop breaking the things that works fine.  


**Performance** \- was fine, but broken in one patch, and nobody know if we'll ever get it back.  
**Sound** \- was totaly fine, but somewhy they decided to ""upgrade"" it. Well done there.  


Pls, just stop making new features at the game every 2 weeks if you can't do it without 100 new bugs and fix those FPS issues that affects everybody for months already.

In short...
heavy bullets penetrates stone/wood but not metal
medium penetrates wood but not stone or metal
light ammo/shotguns penetrate nothing.

This would encourage farming and building more with higher strength materials such as stone and metal.  Discourage stall tactics to cornered players who box themselves up and continually place wood walls until they run out of mats or their attacker runs out of ammo.  Smgs and shotguns are still viable for close range but medium and heavy bullet using weapons all receive an extra utility bump. 

Drum gun/lmgs may need to be rebalanced or have rarity reclassified as a result but I think this could yield some interesting gameplay changes.

However with bloom it can lead to unfair fights as one person may be getting bloom in favour of them. This is why people say it will fail as a competitive/e-sports game.

Demanding Epic to fix both these completely contradict each other and is not possible.Mechanic-wise the game is in a great spot, with a fix to the meta (which is clear most of the community does not enjoy) the game will be enjoyable for competitive and casual gamers.

I'm not sure what the problem is but I'm here to defend why I chose to use a keyboard and mouse as well as hear everyone's problems with my actions.

I didn't pick up a keyboard and mouse for any advantage, I had never played a computer game that required anything more than the arrow keys before. I simply chose a keyboard and mouse because it was different and coming from an IT background it seemed like a fun thing to try. Quite frankly I found it hard as hell. I had to get my keys mapped right, mess with settings, figure out how to aim. I thought about quiting and returning my equipment many times. It eventually got easier but to this day I'm still a horrible builder, yeah I had keys mapped but everything, no matter the controller input, takes time and practice to master, so I don't see the advantage you all talk a lot about. There isn't a difference between a fornite pro with a keyboard or a controller because if you master something you're good at it.

I've also see people state that there isn't any input lag. Input lag, to the human eye is dependant upon the medium in which the picture is cast upon. For example, someone with a ps4 has a maximum frame rate due to the limitations of the ps4 and TV OR monitor they play on. Input lag is a given. Now someone on a PC playing in a ps4 lobby has a true advantage because their medium has no frame rate limitations if the hardware is there. (PC hardware is upgradable) 

The point I'm getting at is that you PS4 controller users are being hypocrites. You are falsy claiming you have a disadvantage due to the input a PS4 user is using and are rallying to have PS4 players with a mouse and keyboard to be put in PC lobbies where we will have a TRUE disadvantage from a HARDWARE perspective and to me that isn't fair to us. 

I think part of your all movement spurs from you all not truly understanding what does and does not create a disadvantage in Fornite and this causes a tear in our community. Now I'm not here to argue, but simply discuss concerns so we can hear each other out and educate. So I'm looking forward to hearing you alls thoughts",FortNiteBR

I feel like this was one of the few LTMs that was done right. 

Normal matches can take 30+ minutes and gameplay can be slow at times. For this LTM, matches are guaranteed to be 15-16 minutes max and gameplay is more fast paced. A thing I really like is how it almost encourages players to get into battles and play more aggressively. 

I made some new friends the other day and we've found a pretty solid tactic for winning. I've gotten majority of my Squad wins this season just from playing this mode the past few days. 

The main reason why I think the LTM should stay is to encourage faster paced gameplay. Plus there's lots of people out there that don't have the time to play like they would, and the guaranteed match times allow for said players to manage their time and get in more game time. 

Do you guys like this LTM? Think it should stay? Should any changes be made? 

Post your thoughts!

-No delay after editing. So you can shoot inmediately after editing.

-Atleast a consistency buff, so it doesnt hit these low 7-12 shots anymore.

-Make it switch normal and faster again. (Not between guns, and other shotguns)

This post isn’t meant to be like a angry request at Epic that they immediately have to change the pump.

 Its more a suggestion, which would make every player happy. Because the pump is not at its best position at the moment.

This is most noticeable when aiming down the sights using either a scoped or thermal scoped assault rifle. The bug seems to be related to reloading. A similar thing seems to happen when reloading other weapons, although this jerk is much smaller (probably because the aim is not zoomed in in these situations).

Here is a video of me using the scoped AR for a minute in playgrounds, providing visual proof of the bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7YyEb7WZ5Y

The reticle jerk is clearly visible at 0:14, 0:24, 0:37 and 0:53. You can see the slighter jerk when reloading as well at 0:01 (this is much more visible when running the video at 0.25x or 0.5x speed). Keep in mind the jerking seem to happen to me way more often in regular games when compared to playground games.

I've seen several people say that they have experienced similar reticle jerk issues, however most of them thought it was their mouse acting up and not the game. The fact that a lot of people are experiencing this issue with different mice ever since patch 5.2 proves otherwise. I hope we can draw some attention to this bug as it is extremely annoying and makes the scoped and thermal scoped ar practically useless, while presumably also affecting other weapons albeit very slightly.

Any support for this would be greatly appreciated.

**TLDR read the bold words**

  
I'm a big fan of the 'promise' of stealth based game play offered by **the bush**, but currently, it's **does more harm than good**. 

It makes you easier to spot while running, obscures a lot of your vision, and makes it harder to aim in a firefight. Not to mention it's legendary, which means I keep getting excited to see that orange glow, just to get my heart broken.  


**Here's how to make it better, and still balanced.**

* **Bush only covers you while crouching**, and is not instantly destroyed by shots taken specifically while standing up (Not in bush mode)
* **Bush appears on your back while standing** so that anyone who sees you running knows you might turn into a bush if you break line of sight.
* Bush also **uses the jetpack  'fuel' meter as a health bar, for damage taken while standing, (A single shot taken while crouched will still destroy the bush**, or disable it temporarily.)

Making the bush only appear while crouched **gives the player a lot more control** and makes it feel less frustrating when caught in a fight, and the additional durability means you **can still try to play stealthy if you survive a firefight, or get caught in the storm briefly.**  


Putting it in the backpack category balances the new pros to the bush as it **would now consistently take one item slot**, and **there would be a clear tell that an enemy was holding a bush if you caught them standing.**

There has been a long debated theory regarding fortnite battle royale taking place in a virtual space, almost like a training ground, where characters from save the world go to train. Numerous things point to this, most of all the fact you don't die, you're almost teleported out of the game by a small drone.

The theory I propose is that this theory is true, and the ""worlds collide"" theme is in fact the virtual world colliding with the real world, and I mean that in the sense that we're taking fortnite battle royale to be a real world within the fortnite universe instead of the virtual world within a virtual world which I propose. Are you still. With me? Good. 

 We thought for so long that this season was going to be history theme, and aside from the ragnarok skin, that hasn't been the case. There's been no pyramids as we expected, yeah there's the viking village however aside from that, the tier 1 and tier 100 skins, the main focus of the map in this season has been the introduction of the desert area. But what if the visitor was human? What if the visitor was simply a futuristic astronaut who is a character from fortnite save the world, who left earth to find a new habitable planet following the apocalypse in save the world fortnite, and some how found himself phasing into the fortnite battle royale training simulator. This would also make sense with the movie storyline because itd make much more sense to film a movie in a virtual space because there is no limit on creative potential. 

The final point is one of those which, on the very off chance this turns out to be true, we could be kicking ourselves that we didn't notice it. That is the ""glitch in the system"" contrail. This could literally be a red flag epic epic are sticking right under our noses that the crack in the sky is a glitch in the fortnite battle royale simulator, created by the visitor by leaving the virtual battle royale simulator, which wasn't designed to be left. Also, this bunker found within wailing woods could almost me a control hub or server mainframe kind of area where all the information and data from the battle royale simulator is stored, and was installed following a surge in popularity of people entering the simulator (to Coincide with the rise in fortnite' real life popularity). 

Let me know what you think. 

TLDR: a fleshed out theory on fortnite battle royale being a simulator. Within the fortnite save the world universe.

Is it just me or does everything seem a bit random and unorganised now? “Worlds Collide” just hasn’t resonated enough yet and it’s the halfway point of the season. know it really doesn’t matter too much either way and gameplay isn’t impacted by it but I personally enjoy it so I was wondering if anyone else noticed or was getting the same feeling.


Thoughts and opinions are appreciated!

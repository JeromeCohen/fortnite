The map looks awesome and the zombies are a nice touch and even though they can be a little annoying I will miss them.

This season has reminded me how fun and goofy this game really is, towards the end of season 4 and the whole of 5 I was sweaty af trying to protect a high win rate and was having a fraction the fun I used to have but this season has reminded me that this isn't a 'competitive' game and I'm loving playing it again. 

People love to complain about the seasonal meta changes but they're doing a great job of keeping it fresh and enjoyable

I personally can‚Äôt stand it. I know some fortnite activist is gonna just say i‚Äôm complaining but i wanna play the game and still have fun. This fortnitemares stuff was honestly a disaster. It was probably the least fun i‚Äôve ever had playing this game. The zombies were so loud and annoying, it was almost impossible to hear anything final circle or revive a teammate, not being able to take a break off fighting for a couple seconds because another team/person would fly in and third party. I‚Äôve spent about 4 months playing this game continuously when i can, but this week i didn‚Äôt, i mostly played bo4, which is also broken but a lot more enjoyable than fortnite right now. I know it doesn‚Äôt matter if they lost me, it‚Äôs one person but i really love this game and i don‚Äôt wanna feel like informing myself to play so that i remain my knowledge and skill on it. I really hope the redeploy is gone whenever the next patch is after the upcoming one but by the looks of it, it‚Äôs probably gonna be permanent, and i have no idea why. it has no place in regular game modes. there‚Äôs no space to breathe for a couple seconds and it‚Äôs basically all luck based now. It‚Äôs always like a 5 team/player build fight and whoever gets the luckiest positioning or who has the most mats is gonna win. idk maybe i shouldn‚Äôt judge and maybe it won‚Äôt be as bad without the zombies but personally, i think it needs to go forever.",FortNiteBR

And let's be clear, this doesn't provide a competitive advantage.

The frostwing glider, it's a dragon. In almost every other media out there, you ride a dragon, you don't clutch its legs. So, I made a post depicting how it would look more cool if you were on top of the dragon. Well it seems the try hards think that will make you harder to shoot down. So let's explain how this feature would work so they can maybe learn something.

Firstly, no one out there is going to say more than 5% of their kills is from shooting a person who was directly, 100% vertically above them. So, the entire reason for try hards not liking this idea is founded on a delusion that they are always under looking straight up with aimbot accuracy. 

Now, no, the glider wouldn't have a hitbox, it wouldn't block bullets, it would all be PURELY visual, the same way hiding in a bush blocks you from view, is the extent the glider would block you from being seen. The same way a bush doesn't block bullets, is the same way a glider wouldn't block bullets. It's visual, and nothing more. Being on top of certain gliders, makes sense for that specific glider. Anyone who isn't a try hard cry baby, knows it will look so much better visually for this to happen. 

So let's sum this up: 
-you are on top of the glider
-it doesn't block bullets
-it provides no competitive advantage

If that wasn't clear enough to explain the idea, think of this, you are a try hard, and you have the high ground already. So chances are, you will be above someone as they use a launch pad or redeploy feature, so as it currently stands, (in these try hards minds) having the high ground is a disadvantage when the opponent has a glider, because having the high ground means you cants shoot them because the glider is blocking them, so that about sums up how the try hards who DV my last post have no idea what they are talking about. Thanks for reading, I look forward to your DV's :) ",FortNiteBR

While this is a great strategy there should be a consequence to getting up this high in the air.

There are still many other alternatives to getting down such as walling down with a ramp, launch pads, impulse nades, rift to go and what used to be bounce pads. Adding another safe way to get down that can be used at any moment you want without consequence should not have a place in this game.

You should be punished if you are that reckless to get high in the air without a strategy to get down and is definitely another high quality skill in this game that the redeployment eliminates.

It also totally changes the entire mechanics of the game as third partying and running from the storm become so much easier. It takes out so much strategy from the game that already has soooo much mobility with 3 vehicles and those mentioned above. Acquiring these mobility items is a unique strategy and again being able to just build a few ramps and jump off is just way too easy and accessible and allows players to play more reckless.

If Epic really wants to keep this mechanic in the game I have a suggestion: Limit the number of redeployment uses per game to 3-5 ish? This would bring back strategy to using mobility and would make players think before just blindly jumping off mountains and building a few ramps as they may realize they would need to use the redeployment later in the game.",FortNiteBR

For those unaware; currently thanks to the new friends/social system, it's impossible (or seemingly so) to complete the ""play with a friend"" daily challenge - yet that challenge hasn't been disabled or anything because... reasons. Worse though is the fact that our friend XP boosts are currently not working, which means we're missing out on up to 40% XP from every match, part of the battle pass that we actually paid for but Epic have yet to fix.

Epic are more than happy to remove a glitch that enabled people to get a free boost but apparently can't be bothered fixing or even addressing an issue which is making us lose what we've already paid for/earned. I had to use search to find *any* mentions of the broken friend boosts, how is this not a bigger deal?

Before anyone jumps on me ""fixes like this can take time"", yes I know that, that doesn't stop Epic addressing the issue. Right now the battlepass is false advertising as the friend boost listed is non-existant, I'd have thought that would be serious enough for a mention at the least.",FortNiteBR

As someone who has played since day one, it's mind boggling how the devs could just say, ""ok fuck it."" And remove so many aspects of the core game since day 1 in one fell swoop. 

Glider redeploy honestly takes away more from the game than it adds. Yes landing on the corners used to suck if you had a circle on the opposite side of the map, but there's usually rifts in all corners of the map or vehicles to negate dying to the storm. It's truly no longer an issue. I can't remember the last time I died to the storm because of a bad circle spawn unless it was my own fault.

I used to see a build fight in the distance and if I had a heavy sniper, guess what? 2 guys are getting eliminated to fall damage from 150 meters away. You can say what you want about knocking players builds down, but that's all part of the game. Really is a terrible addition to the game that's being made.

This could of easily been an LTM feature added to blitz mode. It would of been fine for blitz mode. But this decision is just wrong.

All week I have found fights now last significantly longer and have no real risk to them. Literally the way to battle someone now is to see them fighting someone else off in the distance, quickly ramp up however high you need and glide in to the fight to third party or clean up.

Previously, you could only do this with a jump pad and if you decided to do it, you had to make damn sure your ramp wasnt shot out as you did it because that meant death. There was risk associated with hard pushing people.

Now, there is no risk. You just ramp battle the hell out of the other player, and if they get the better of you, you dip.

Casual players are going to constantly be pounded now in solos because there is no point actually being first to the circle and holding it down. People can just drop in on you at any time even though you may have made the smartest plays all game, strategised correctly and gotten yourself in the right position.

The risk is just taken out of building and quickly moving now. The strategy is really simple. You drop edge of map, loot up, no pressure from storm speed because you can just ramp in, and move in with each circle third partying or pressuring only when needed.

I cannot believe epic didn't at least increase the height from which you needed to be to deploy, I believe at least 7 would have been right so that if you did decide to ramp rush someone you still had the risk of fall damage if you got caught.

Epic, seriously. This change drastically hurts the gameplay. You might as well as constant storm movement or at least blitz to force players to use their materials or double shotgun because you don't really mind its over powered.

I've been playing over a year with more than 1,000 wins across the modes and its the first time the game has felt like its significantly jumped in a direction that is not enjoyable.

I'd be keen to see the data you mention that has lead you to this decision because the general community feedback I have broadly seen is entirely against the change as it is. Either make redeploy an item you carry to boost your glider or some sort of other height increase.

Thanks guys.",FortNiteBR

Good job Epic... This game is a 3rd/4th/5th/6th party mess right now. Engaging and disengaging fights is WAY too accessible. This just encourages avoiding most fights for wins for fear of 2-3 teams jumping on you simultaneously, or turtling/hiding when other teams engage your fight. Gliding away isn't REALLY a feasible option either when those teams can just follow you. This game was the most fun when you could 1v1 (or team v team) with only the worry of usually 1-2 other teams hearing you, but not quite being able to reach you until after most of the fighting's over.

This is pretty damn close to the worst state the game has been in, just behind the SMG meta pre-nerf. This will eventually drive diehard people away. It's already doing it with my friends, who are all pretty competitive. We can't let the conversation on this fade away!",FortNiteBR

Finally quit CSGO (played ESEA MDL, which is ""Semi-Professional"") and moved on to Fortnite, which is a much more enjoyable game for me. Started playing Fortnite about 3 months ago so I could bond a bit with my nephew, hence my alias. I finally started taking the game seriously, since I am a competitive person by nature.

Having years of experience in Counterstrike has helped me tremendously in regards to aiming, but only recently did I feel like my building has improved. However, because of the muscle memory I developed in CSGO, the current sensitivity I am using is 0.06 @ 400 dpi. Does anyone else use a sensitivity this low on PC?

Also, for someone who has just started the game, but shows promise... how does one get noticed in the scene? I know there are ""pro discords"" for established professionals... but are there any organized, intermediate/advanced-level discords that I can apply for? For example, I know a guy in the semi-pro CSGO scene that goes by the alias ""Strings"", and I found out that his brother won \~$80k in a Fortnite tournament. His brother's fortnite alias is Reverse2k (he's insane...). I don't expect to win money anytime soon, don't get me wrong, LOL... but how does someone who had no connection to the pro scene, get involved and invited to skirmishes? Any information on this would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again for all of your help.

My fortnite id is ""Uncle\_Amos ttv"" for stats if you were curious. Been focusing the last few days on actually winning games instead of dropping at all of the hotspots and fragging out, or losing to RNG and dying before I grab a gun, haha. So my k/d could be a bit better. Anyways, thanks again for your time!

TLDR: Ex-semi pro CSGO player focusing on competitive fortnite, but doesn't know where to start. Any help would be great!

I know y‚Äôall have been frustrated about landing in the opposite side of where the circle is, this mechanic helps you loot for a longer time, and makes you value your mats more since you need mats to gain height for most of the time so you can redeploy. 

With the zombies, they provide shield when you need some, so you don‚Äôt only have to depend on mushrooms or actual shields always, and the cost is exposing yourself to enemies with the loud bullets you‚Äôre wasting on the zombies. Another pro is that they discourage people from turtling.

I was surprised when everyone was against it to be in the Fall Skirmish, because I mean of course it‚Äôs unfortunate that people practice a certain type of play style and rotation, but Fortnite is a fast changing game, they update the game very often, and with so many people turtling in the skirmishes, I thought that zombies would have a lot of support from the community saying that the game is extremely passive. Zombies would have been deadly for players who stay in low ground, encouraging them to fight for high ground. It just seems like when Epic comes up with a solution with certain problems, there‚Äôs a big backlash and negativity coming from the people who were originally asking for a solution.

This will be a longer post, but bare with me. Epic does a great job listening to the community, especially this subreddit, and I would hate for people judging a big change too quickly to prevent epic from keeping it around. Here are some problems that this game has faced for a long time that redeploy has fixed.

1) people lost their minds when bouncers were vaulted (rightfully so). With redeploy we get so utilize the same strategies you use bouncers for, without the RNG of needing to loot it as an item.

2)people have whined about how way too many people land titled/how boring mid game is with 75% of the lobby being dead in the first few minutes. Theres has been a noticeable difference in the balance of landing spots with people being able to land anywhere and quickly rotate.

3)redeploy helps create a skill gap that isnt RNG based. A skilled player will utilize the redeploy to drop on unsuspecting players.

4) rotations are great. No need to be worried about running from the storm all game just to survive, and high kill games are far less luck based as they were before.

5)Third partying was such a frustrating thing. You could be having a great game but if you found your self in the middle of three other people, unless you have a launch pad or turtle, you are probably screwed. Now, you can disengage with ease. Sure, more people can third party with this increased mobility, but you are able to counter it with a quick build and take off.

6)how many times have you been in the final 3/4 people and the circle is very small, and the guy who happens to be closest to the next circle way into the storm has a huge advantage. Now, instead of having to run like he from the storm and spam build why the spray from a tower, you can fly right to the next zone. 

7)there is a lot of controversy over the zombies right now (i personally love the change of pace and intensity) but i understand its not everyones cup of tea. But dont let your feelings towards zombies impact your out look on redeploy.

TLDR: Redeploy has a ton of benefits to the game and has fixed alot of game flow/mechanic issues people have been complaining about for months. Its a big change yes, and requires a change in strategy, but we should be embracing this new concept. Let me know what you guys think",FortNiteBR

##Feedback for the Glider redeployment mechanic

If you are unaware, EPIC has recently added a new mechanic to the game known as 'glider redeployment' in the v6.20 update. This allows for the player to redeploy their glider from 3 stories or higher. This mechanic was taken from the soaring 50's game-mode and applied to all default modes.

We are making this thread to help compile all the feedback the community has regarding the new redeployment mechanic, this is to reduce the amount of generic spam on this topic and to also allow for wide constructive discussion about the implementation of this new mechanic.

Discuss below what are your thoughts on the mechanic, should it stay? Should it go? Any adjustments which you think should be made to make it fit well in the game. All feedback is welcome and we expect in depth discussion on how well this mechanic fits in-game.

So a 3 month assessment here, the $1,074 is just from my video game card, I don't want to do the math with my bank card... 

As of today, I may be done.

So, first things first: Yes, I know it's a bit excessive/irresponsible and No, I don't think that X amount of money entitles me to anything. These are not worth mentioning here.

Also,  the money is from both BR and STW. It was primarily spent on my account, however I do have my wife, and 2 very active kids who spend on Fortnite as well. My wife is really cheap though. She has the limited edition and the Power chord set and that's pretty much it. 

So this morning, I spent another $30 to try and get the last Smasher survivor to get Jacko-launcher; it was unsuccessful.

I'm very upset about not getting that Smasher survivor. Not in the salty sense, but more like ""wow, is this what it's come to"" sense.  I found myself really ill with the RNG last night trying to get my last crypt which I didn't didn't complete either. 

These things put me in a temporary place of ""I give them all of this money and I can't get the 1 GD thing I'm after while 12 yrs. old Timmy ain't spent shit and get's it on day 1!"".  I let it go because I don't really feel it in that way, I was just frustrated in the moment. 

I don't mind the cheap RNG BS, but drop rates get me furious sometimes. Especially with money grab RNG. I like how Overwatch has it set up to have a currency to purchase what just wont drop. That'd have been nice in Fortnite, but whatever - right?

Anyway, so maybe I'll get over it, maybe I won't, but I'm feeling kind of done with this Fortnite spending. I really don't want to give them another fucking dime. 

It's hard to explain, but it just doesn't feel appreciated. I don't feel like I need it on the first drop every time nor do I need a thank you letter for every dollar, but it just feels like a waste and I've never felt that way about gaming. As much as my family and I enjoy BR and STW, right now I'm just like WTF. Again, it's hard for me to explain, but the amount of money I spent just feels lost, thrown away, unappreciated. I know it's just digital junk, but my point is that it's never felt like this - to me, it's new and weird.

Any other casual spenders feeling like this? 

Sorry this was long-ish.

Option 1 is when the skin needs 500,000 XP to max out, and XP earned before unlocking the skin is transferred over. This is the same as Ragnarok and somewhat like Omega (Omega was levels instead of XP).

Option 2 is when the skin needs only 250,000 XP to max out, but any XP earned before unlocking the skin doesn't count. This the current system in play for Dire.

So, my question is, which option do you prefer? 

In my personal opinion, I would prefer Option 2 **if the skin was anything other than Dire.** The last 4 stages of Dire are just recolors instead of actually changing the character, so I don't feel any incentive to actually get more than the first or second Wolf color. Especially if your favorite Wolf color is the Brown or White ones, why would you want to earn the last form if you'll never use it? 

Now, had the Tier 100 skin been Calamity, where the skin changes completely, by adding an Overcoat, glowing decals, and smoke, then I would definitely feel incentive to max it out using Option 2. Hell, I already did max out Calamity and I love using it. It's a big reason why I never used Ragnarok because I didn't like Tier 4 but would never reach Tier 5 by the end of the season. 

Overall I feel like Option 2 encourages players to buy out the entire pass Day 1 (which I think is a scummy thing to do, as I think it should take most of the season) whereas Option 1 encourages players to grind for long amounts of time in order to get the best form of a skin. One takes effort, and you'll be rewarded for it, while the other takes cold hard cash in order to get it at a similar pace to previous season's skins.

TL;DR: Which XP system do you like more? Rag and Omega that encourage grinding, or Dire that encourages spending money?",FortNiteBR

It costs $40 Canadian instead of the usual amount. This morning it has not changed so buy them while you can! This is on Xbox, but you can also buy them from the Microsoft store at this price.

Pack 1: 1000 vbucks  = $13.49 CAD ($9.99 US)

Pack 2: 2800 vbucks  = $33.49 CAD ($24.99 US)

Pack 3: 5000 vbucks  = $39.99 CAD ($39.99 US)

Pack 4: 13500 vbucks = $133.49 CAD ($99.99 US)


For those who don't like math, if you buy pack 3 three times, you get 15000 vbucks for $120 CAD - A much better deal than even the most expensive pack. 

Not sure how long it has been this way, but it won't be like this for long. With a patch tomorrow it will probably be fixed regardless of it getting attention. Spread the word!

Looking online (give or take, cant be entirely sure if it is correct, especially because i dont remember every single legendary skin in the game) i counted 46 skins that are currently legendary and there are 113 epic skins (mind you that is also counting every one of the alpine ace variations, which i feel is fair because there were people who bought all of them.) Now if i look at blues, there are 51 blue skins and 31 green skins. The two most expensive colors have over double the amount of skins that the two cheapest colors have. Mind you i counted every skin in the game, i don't want anyone thinking i am trying to fudge numbers or be misleading here, But if you think about it, there are more 20 dollar skins then there are 8 dollar skins. Now i already see people saying that the 2000 vbucks skins are cooler and have more work into them then an 800 vbucks skin would, but we can tell that isnt really right either by bunnymoon and patch patroller. They are simpler skins then say deadfire or calamity, but it could be argued that they are just as good. Another thing to take into consideration is that people have been asking for cheaper skins to be made since season 2, people like the cheaper skins, whether it is because they like the more plain look, or just because it is cheaper on the wallet, either way they are wanted. Honestly i paid for almost 6k worth of vbucks and i ended up blowing through it all on the full skull trooper set and 1 extra pickaxe. Epic would not lose money by making more cool and cheaper green skins, it would probably end up making more money in the long run because those who would purchase if things were just a bit cheaper might start buying if you start realizing skins and sets cheaper then we have been getting recently. Hell you could start throwing complete bundles together with green skins and their matching pieces for 15 bucks and i think people would enjoy it. Honestly, i just feel at the end of the day, we could use less gold and purple, and more green and blue.

TL:DR there are 160+ gold and purple skins, and less then 85 blue and green skins, Stop making exclusively expensive skins, make some cheaper ones, people want them and patch patroller and bunnymoon show they can still have some cool detail.",FortNiteBR

Normal weapons have a much smaller chance of that because one bullet will hit randomly in the crosshairs(Unlike shotguns where a ton of fragments deal a good amount of damage hit all over the hitbox. The pump and Heavy are fine though the tac and double barrel have a bigger hitbox, leading to less aim skill needed. 

Some of you may say that SMGs are no skill weapons. You are needing to track your target when using an SMG when firing, SMGs deal less damage on first shot than shotguns. Shotguns can be a 1 shot kill, this is why I say epic needs to be less relaxed on shotguns and start dealing with shotguns. I mix between a big hitbox where you have a much higher chance of hitting and a possible one-shot kill is the most op combination you can have. Tacs and double barrels may be worse but at least deal with the op combos, nerf the pump and heavy, and vault the tac and double barrel. I swear this would fix the game and make this game a more fun to play!

I really want to enjoy it, I just feel that the newest additions a long with the re-release of certain ""OG"" skins (I hate what the term ""OG"" has become in this community) have cause the game to feel far to manic. Back in season 1 and 2 the map and the game felt clean, simple and fun. I feel that the current map and the ""Cube"" have just caused way to much chaos within the game, along with the constant stream of new weapons (Did we really need a quad launcher?)

I want to enjoy it, I just find that EPIC have taken things to far. I dont think I will ever get my ""Clean"" version of Fortnite back again and its a shame. Fortnite has provided me with many hours of entertainment. I just personally don't enjoy the game anymore. For lack of a better metaphor, I feel like Fortnite was a carrot and coriander soup, perfectly balanced, and EPIC was the chef, constantly adding more ingredients that just didnt belong and made the soup taste like shit. 

Let me know how you feel about it, im sure many of you will like the changes of recent seasons. I personally however feel that the game is just far too ""busy"" with stuff like the cube, the runes, the new vechiles  so many un-needed new weapons (WHO ASKED FOR A QUAD LAUNCHER!?

## (originally got deleted. new to reddit and forgot to ""flair."")

&amp;#x200B;

During S4, my main goal for the end of the season was to unlock the max Omega. Unfortunately, I only got to about level 76. This was due to the fact that I had an important test that literally decided my future. I think it was better than I focused on the test rather than grinding a few for levels for the max Omega. I know that a bunch of friends (including internet friends and random people I played with during the start of S5) were also just a few levels short of reaching the max Omega. One person I played with got to level 79.

This is my suggestion: For S4 players with Omega/Carbide, you (Epic) should create a mini-event lasting 1-3 weeks where players get the Omega/Carbide challenges back (but it's the XP you needed to get rather than getting to level 80, which is stupid as most people are level 20-40 at the moment.). Obviously, I know your company needs to make money. For new players, you (Epic) could create re-skins of S4 skins, such a white Omega, or a red Carbide, or also make a couple more super-hero/movie skins. This would create hype and money from new players, and would allow players that needed a little bit more XP for the final stages of Omega/Carbide to be happy.

For many players that bought the battle pass in the middle of the season were also unable to unlock the final omega, or even the second to the last stage. One of my friends bought it in the middle of the season (and played quite a bit) and wasn't even able to complete the mask stage for Omega.

Please Epic, the final stage adds so much to the skin. This would allow your company to collect revenue and would allow S4 players to have more customization in their skin.",FortNiteBR

The battle pass has XP boosts, friend xp boosts, regular xp, v bucks.

People have been playing with the xp boosts they earned from this for a few days now. You expect them to count how much xp they should have if they didn't unlock that particular tier? Should they take away the extra xp their friends may have earned?

Then we have v bucks. Lots of people probably already spent the battle pass v bucks they may have earned from this bug. Do they get their skins taken away as well? How is that fair? My friend was 100 short on a skin so he was gonna buy a 1000 pack to buy the bunny skin. But thanks to this bug he unlocked 100 extra. What happens here? Does he just get fucked out of a skin?

And lastly, people are begging to give EVERYONE 35 free tiers. This is just absurd. Epic already lost tons of money thanks to this.  Do you really expect a company to want to lose even more?

If you don't know, recently there was a bug with the Fortnitemares challenges that conveniently gave you hundreds of free battle stars that would easily level you up.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think is strange about this is the fact that you can keep all of these so ""earned"" stars. I think that this should not happen and that Epic should revoke all of the battle stars earned using this bug (Not sure about all of the software things and if this is even possible). Why you may ask? Well because earning battle stars takes a long time and requires a lot of patience and grinding. The fact that nearly a third of the battle pass can be unlocked within a couple of minutes is absurd! Yes this is good for those who were able to get the free stars, and yes this is good for the click bait YouTubers, but this is definitely not good for those who have spent the time grinding the battle pass.

And just imagine what someone who spent money to buy the entire (or parts) of the battle pass must have felt!

&amp;#x200B;

Also just a conspiracy; This so called ""glitch"" might actually have been made on purpose, its extremely odd to see such a large company make such an impact-full mistake (THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT ITS PROBABLY NOT REAL).

&amp;#x200B;

I see it getting a LOT of flak on this sub but personally I don't think that I can ever go back to regular old fortnite after this week and will be stuck with whatever LTM has with redeploy enabled (if there will be). Am I the only one? 

I mean, everyone agrees that the biggest issue with BRs is the mid game. Everyone drops in a hot zone, and in the best case 50% of people die within the first 5 minutes. You have to run for minutes before you find someone (or get sniped by someone that is just camping on top of a mountain). Then the last circles come, everyone gets condensed in a single place, and the game is finally fun again. This is fixed with redeploy.

Mind you, this is my experience, I would like to know how **you** perceive the average game, because to me those long stretches of nothingness are **BORING**. 

From my comment from the 6.20 feedback thread:

&gt;However, I do not understand why people hate the redeploy so damn much. IMO, it's a good addition. Yes, people run away, but you can --&gt;&gt; !! CHASE THEM !! &lt;&lt;--. And it's stupid fun to do so. It's the thrill of the hunt.

Finished looting and got nothing to do except waiting for the next zone? Build up a ramp in the sky and look for other people. There is no downtime. *All* the game is fun instead of just the beginning and the end.

However, I understand that some people see the ""no downtime"" as a negative, but no one actually forces you to seek out people, and you can still go to the (now accessible) remote areas such as Haunted Hills if you want a more relaxed approach. You just have to watch out for the eagles.

The build battles change, but not really. You just do not get punished for building too high, which I really do not see as an issue since if you wanted you could just carry around a port-a-rift or something else to negate the fall damage. If anything, it makes them more balanced because you can always nope out of there with the glider instead of being forced into it if you see that the guy overpowers you. Which is fair on his end as well, because as I mentioned, he can still chase you.

I really do not see any actual issue with it except for the fact that you can ""outplay"" people by shooting down their ramps/buildings and killing them with fall damage instead of, you know, shooting at them. 

Can we talk about it? What is your biggest issue with it? I honestly just want to understand because I feel like an actual alien out here. I can't possibly be the only one having this much fun with it.",FortNiteBR

This game and so many makes people feel like shit and get tired of playing that game but in my case, even when I'm 'done' with the game, I'm there 10 mins later because a video made me want to play more but I come back to feel like crap again because I can't even play decent.

The Rocket Launcher should be a weapon for tearing down buildings, and it does this pretty well. However, the Rocket Launcher should not be used as a substitute shotgun, where it can do OVER 100 DAMAGE in a single shot. Personally, out of the 10 games I played today, there was someone using the Rocket Launcher close range in at least 8 of them. 

The Rocket Launcher also takes little to no skill to operate. You just have to be able to not shoot the wall directly in front of you, and you'll be fine. Even if you get just 1 hit off with the Rocket Launcher, you'll knock over half the hp from a fully shielded opponent. That's more than a well-placed shotgun hit. Think about that. A gun that takes little to no skill to operate does more damage at close range than your shotgun blast, that actually requires some semblance of skill. 

Should Epic Remove the rocket Launcher? By no means. The Rocket Launcher is great at its intended purpose of tearing down buildings. However, the Rocket Launcher should not be used as a tool for close range combat. How do we fix this? Keep the damage to buildings the same, but reduce the damage that the Rocket Launcher does to players. Maybe reduce it to 60 in 1 hit, where it still can be a viable last option.

484,ActualEngineering,1540946124,9stuvy,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9stuvy/a_critical_review_of_fortnite/,1,A Critical Review of Fortnite," Fornite makes for an excellent case study regarding the human condition and moral degradation of society, alongside undertones of existentialism. Verily, this gruesome spectacle highlights the tenuous line between anarcho-capitalist consequentialism vs. outright Machiavellianism-induced genocide.

In the view of the existentialist, an individual's starting point (pre-game lobby) is characterized by what has been called ""the existential attitude"", or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Introspective sentiments such as ""How did I get here?"" ""What is the purpose of this?"" ""Am I alive?"" ""Why am I wearing a Pink Bear costume?"" are all quite commonplace. However, the one observable certainty is that you are not alone in your endeavor, but one of 99 other souls cast the same fate. Inevitably thereafter, you discover the baffling reality of being completely impervious to harm. Coincidentally, the same phenomenon manifests itself in your peers. ""No Violence? Despite an infinite arsenal of weaponry?"" one might ask, segueing into a myriad of natural religious postulates. ""Is this Heaven, Nirvana, Elysium, Valhalla, etc?"" -- epiphanies, all of which share one thematic truth: This is an anecdotal utopia. The shared reassurance of safety establishes a commonality amongst these strangers, fostering a sense of community, promoting ideals of love, family, fulfillment, and belonging. Through this social fabric and perceived immortality, 'The Golden Rule' is forever cemented into the very fiber of humanity.... Or, so they thought....

Until, one day, the Fire Nation attacked, unveiling a raw, uncensored humanity in all its evils. Once a paradise, this benevolent world is forcibly torn asunder, leaving endless carnage of natural selection and misanthropy in its wake. ‚ÄúTrickle-Down Economics‚Äù undergoes a sinister redefinition, replacing long-term reward with instant gratification of material goods, trickling down from the bloody, mutilated confetti of another's remains. Likewise, the only pertinent Keynesian takeaway was ominously coined by John Maynard Keynes, himself, ‚ÄúIn the long run we are all dead.‚Äù Perhaps most distressing of all is the grim reality that no ‚ÄòVictory Royale‚Äô is attainable, not even for the lone survivor; however, the human player can reap invaluable lessons from this experience.

Whom could be responsible for orchestrating such a heinous dystopia? - None other than tyrannical government left to its own devices. Fortnite truly is the quintessential allegory of George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 incarnate. What truly instigated this bloodshed? It certainly was not resource scarcity, nor innate hatred of one another. Nay, children learn that the culpability lies solely upon self-appointed bureacrats and their egregious abuse of Eminent Domain. Denizens of Forniteopia found themselves subjected to a series of unlawful seizures of private property, each circle more incrementally oppressive than the last. Much like WWII, the fate of these citizens was not decided the moment they were collectively deported via plane, rather, they were dead the very moment they embraced blissful complacency by reveling in their good fortunes, in lieu of informed democratic diligence. It was not material resource scarcity that killed these men and women, but a scarcity of human freedom and dignity which ultimately tears each game session apart. In true poetic fashion, the defiant, laissez-faire launching of rockets into another's genitals patriotically recoups the only power they have left - the power over one's own mortality.

Something as little as a disco ball for funk ops and maybe making the bullet sash on bandolier a backbling, or something easier, would be amazing. 

Spending 20$ on skins without getting a full package (skin and backbling) like some 12$ skins do is totally not cool. I‚Äôm sure it would mean a lot to the community and for everyone who bought skins 1500 without a backbling to get one. They have done this before with venturion and Ventura. 

Me personally, I bought funk ops around season 2-3 somewhere around there, and didn‚Äôt think that they would ever release a nice looking skin WITH a backbling for LESS. (Looking at you dark bomber.) I would have never bought funk ops knowing they would release more for less in the future. I know that‚Äôs marketing, but I‚Äôm sure epic wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it if it pleased the community.  I would love to see my funk ops running around with a spinning disco ball on his back.

I say all of this with no hate towards epic, I love what they do, this was just a suggestion. ",FortNiteBR

When week 7 dropped the community quickly found what the mystery skin was. The Enforcer seemed like a normal skin with a cool new backbling and loading screen incorporating the skin. However, with this backbling and loading screen I put together a story that seemed to make sense. First, the loading screen for week 7 had the motel sign being rifted back to the battle Royale island. On the sign were three enforcers. This shows us that there are enforcers on the island. Now, let‚Äôs look at the back bling. It‚Äôs called Subjugator. Subjugator comes from the base form subjugate. Subjugate means to take over using force or to take under control. This tells us that the enforcers are going to try to take over the island or even the world. The enforcers got to the island using rifts, and guess who caused rifts to spread all over the island. This is also coincidentally the only other mystery skin, the visitor. The Visitor has a similar color scheme to the Enforcer. Now we know the visitor is associated with the enforcers. I assume that the Visitor marks planets and, using a high speed vehicle, leaves and creates rifts. This provides an entryway for enforcers to go through those rifts after they study the objects on the planet. One thing though. The cube. The cube came from the rift in the sky. When Brite Bomber looks at the reflection of the cube there is a shadow of her in the cube. The cube also can shoot lighting and be bounced on. This leads me to believe that the cube is just a shell that is holding something more important. I think it is holding a dark magic that can transform anything to a inverted form of the actual object. The cube also places runes down. The runes are transforming the normal land into a low gravity area maybe to help the enforcers take over the land in an environment that is more similar. However, here is where we hit a roadblock. The cube is making its way to Loot Lake and from there I don‚Äôt know where it is going. Also most of this is just speculation.

There are many pieces of evidence that also disproves this hypothesis. An example of this is if the visitor did land on the island to mark it how did it know how to get off? This is just an example that, if true, would probably disprove the whole hypothesis.

If you made it to the bottom of this thank you. I would like to hear your feedback both good and bad it could help greatly. Also I would like to collaborate on this because right now I have no clue for the rest so help is also appreciated. Again thank you for taking your time to read this.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, there's 3 rarities, Uncommon, Rare, And Epic. Epic wouldn't need many voice actors as the voices could be chosen would be like selecting styles, Male or Female would be for all emotes but Epic, ill get to those later.

&amp;#x200B;

An uncommon voice line would be something simple - they'd come from the BP or shop for 50 vbucks. An uncommon emote would be something simple, like:

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah!""

""Nice one!""

''Revive me!""

There could also be seasonal uncommon voice lines, like:

""BOO!"" (Halloween)

""Ho Ho Ho!"" (Christmas)

Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

As for rare emotes, they spice it up a bit, usually being a sentience or two and also possibly humorous. They would cost 150 vbucks in the shop and be in the BP. Some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

""Down for the count!""

""Get wrecked suckers!""

""An L for you, and one for you, and one for you as well.""

Seasonal ones:

""Sent 'em to the graveyard"" (Halloween)

""You cant catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"" (Christmas)

&amp;#x200B;

Epic ones will be really special, they'd be said in different voices and you couldn't choose, it wouldn't just be male/fem. It could be something like, dark and creepy, or robotic, etc. Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

""Error - profanity filter enabled"" (Robot voice)

""You cant just hop like a roo' and expect to win"" (Aussie accent)

""Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist"" (Chad voice)

Some seasonal ones:

""Your souls are mine, or my name isn't nevermore..."" (Halloween, scary reaper voice)

""Does anyone have cookies and milk?"" (Christmas, Santa voice)

&amp;#x200B;

I do genuinely want this to be a discussion though, and am just trying to figure out how other skill level players/ players with different experiences feel about this combo. 

The grappler is a strong item and very useful for retaking high ground when low on mats/ an enemy has taken high ground by 2-3 levels. The grappler allows you to get back into the fight with the element of surprise to secure high ground. Typically it gives you the opportunity to reset the fight, and if you‚Äôre a good builder, regain the advantage. It does not usually make sense to begin firing immediately after grappling up to someone, as it essentially an RNG fight of jumping shotguns. 

The double barrel shotty is also a strong item. You have two shots with incredibly high damage output at very very close range. Against any good player, it typically takes some skill to get this close without getting killed and requires a combination of movement, building, and quick edits to bop someone without getting hit for a considerable amount with a pump/ heavy/ smg from further range. 

The problem comes when these two are used together. As annoying as it is to get barrel stuffed with a double barrel, typically you messed up if you get killed by one. Someone should never get close enough to be right next to you and quickly two tap you. Likewise, it can be frustrating when someone grapples up to your high ground, but you can always fight to take it back. 

The problem is that the grappler removes the skill necessary to use the double barrel and the double barrel makes the grappler a tool for negating building, rather than turning an unfair fight into an even one.  The double barrel should require you to close the distance on your opponent, outbuild them, and then edit down or drop down on them to kill them. But with the grappler combo it takes no skill, you just shoot up to them, jump in their build and there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it. Two shots and they‚Äôre gone. 

TL;DR
Grappler and double barrel are okay on their own, becomes broken when combined, doesn‚Äôt take a whole lot of skill to grapple at someone and then stick your double barrel in their belly button and pull the trigger. ",FortNiteBR

Lately however, I feel like the regular game modes have become such sweat fests that I actually NEED energy and to be destressed before playing.

Basically I have been unable to play the game when I get home to destress unless if im playing something like 50v50, but to be completely honest I hate 50's because half the time I either find way too many people and the other half I find no one.

Im not too sure what the point of this post was other than to say I miss the days when I could come home and unwind by playing some solos. Its lame that unless if im at the peak of my game play and energy for the day, I can get no more than 1 or 2 kills because all the people I am fighting are at the peak of their ability and energy.

I thought this player was good, so I checked report player and found out it was Faze Replays. This got me thinking. I have replays turned off for the frame boost, so if I had killed him or not checked report player, I never would have known who I played against. I would imagine there are countless times other people have missed knowing that they fought a notable person because of streamer mode, and to me, this seems against Fortnite's spirit as a social game. I have thought of two solutions to this problem. The first is to force streamers to verify their Twitch/Youtube etc accounts with their Epic Games and have a high enough average viewer count in order to access streamer mode on their account. This solution would solve most of streamer mode's current problems, but is a bit unwieldy. The other solution (my favorite) is to change Streamer Mode so that all it does is introduce an rng delay. This way, if you are in streamer mode, the ONLY thing that changes is matchmaking takes a little bit longer. There would be not visual indication of when you are actually entered in the queue, but if your were randomly entered into the queue at some time between 0 and 30 seconds, it would significantly lower the chance of stream snipers entering your game, without having to introduce a delay into your stream, hindering communication with your community. I also think a combination of these would work, with medium sized streams only using option 2, but huge streams (Ninja, Tfue) being able to verify their account for the og streamer mode, since they have enough stream snipers that option 2 alone would not fully work.

I've been playing the game since late October 2017 and pumped quite some hours into the game all the way up to Season 4 when I stopped playing and caring too much about the game.

Now, I don't follow the game at all but I've been reminscing earlier days of Fortnite and early days of its massive popularity. So I wanna know, people who used to play the game back then and who play now, how does the game compare to you? Are you more invested in it now or back then? Do you think Epic added too many items and mechanics in the game and focused too much on cosmetics/new stuff rather than making what we already had better and improving the quality of the game (I'm not saying the game is not in the good state, I haven't been playing and when I stopped it was in a decent shape, so I can't speak on that regard other than wondering about it). Just overall how does the game in your opinion compare now to before gameplay wise, items wise, fun wise etc.

Low bloom when aiming down, long range, allows tap-firing when bloom is not in your favor (especially effective with the suppressed AR)

‚Ä¢ **Burst rifles**: Now accurate. They‚Äôre not as accurate and effective against structures as auto rifles, but you can take a large portion of the enemy‚Äôs health before they can build 

‚Ä¢ **Shotguns**: I enjoyed the days of one pump as well as season 4 double pump, but shotguns are still strong. They are always carried by everyone for a reason. There is no bloom or RNG to shotguns, so they are the most reliable at dealing close-ranged burst damage, which is essential in a game with building. High damage shots come from good aim and close range, which is refreshing when shotguns one-shot to the body in most other shooters. The tac does feel quite weak, but I see them as an early-game shotgun or a preference pick. The double barrel carries the threat of the old ‚Äúone pumping‚Äù, but with clear downsides.

‚Ä¢ **SMG‚Äôs**: With the removal of the drum gun, SMG‚Äôs feel balanced. The spray meta is gone, but they are still very useful for destroying structures and comboing with shotguns. Also, the P90 now has a purpose in the game.

‚Ä¢ **Snipers**: Sniping in this game is much harder than in most other games with such large bullet travel time and drop. If a sniper manages to headshot me, I commend them for their skill rather than being upset. High skill requirement, high rewards.

‚Ä¢ **Pistols**: They are supposed to be early game weapons when you have nothing else. Not every gun needs to be strong. The hand cannon can be deadly in the right hands, but I do think they could have less bloom. The damage drop off is understandable though, considering it‚Äôs a hitscan weapon.

‚Ä¢ **Explosives**: C4‚Äôs and Clingers were nerfed. Explosives don‚Äôt destroy the structure behind the explosion anymore. Hard to find, an ammo cap. They can be annoying to face, but they are reasonable.",FortNiteBR

my PoV:

you have made a free for all game with no matchmaking whatsoever and only one winner.

and you have added a mechanic that will reward veteran players with permanent cover and permanent mobility.

on top of that you made it one sided third person that allows for the most bullshit tactic in shooter history ever that is corner picking. one sided 3rd person is bad enough on it's own, you had to mix it with all this other elements.

to the typical ""just build lol"" answer:

ok, lets give everyone automatic hitscan snipers that do 200 dmg. is that good? ofc not. its overpowered. just because everyone can have it doesn't mean it's good. and when you don't see if somehing is overpowered in front of your eyes you're blind then.

construction right now does not have counterplay. best builder wins. you can do nothing against it. doesn't matter if you are a pro csgo player because if you don't know to build there is nothing you can do to kill a veteran player. besides pray to RNGesus for a bazooka. not reliable.adding weapons with increased damage against buldings is sadly a pathetic attempt of creating counterplay. so is the grapple. none of those are reliable since are bound to RNG. this leaves me as a new player knowing that right now there is no possible way that I win a game. a man can dream that the classes from save the world would make into battle royale, so you would have actual counters to building. but ofc too confusing for new players, and too meta changing for olders, bah, like construction isn't confusing right now, and like this game wasn't meta changing from any other shooter.

here is my 2 cents if you want to make this game accesible for everyone, because at this point it's not for me. I'm not ready to invest 100h just to have an idea of how to play:

first get rid of construction exploit. construction should not be used in combat. AT ALL. it should be only used in order to either setup in a safe place where you know you are safe to build, or used for situational mobility to reach high places. not to spam mobility. resource cap should be at 100 per material. it's absurd being able to carry a whole city in your pocket. my honest opinion is that construction belongs to save the world and should not be in battle royale. but since you insist on keeping it at least don't make the whole fucking game be only about it.

structures need to be much more vulnerable when constructing, need much longer construction time, and should be pierced with any weapon if not fully constructed.

another nice feature would be programming some code so you would not be able to literally fly with construction.

I draw a example of how I say it should be:

*Processing img 3ronzy1fi0n11...*

another thing I want to talk about is the weapons. I know you are aware about this because it has been adressed, still it's not enough. you would thought that from a full magazine fired to a target at 10 m with an assault rifle, a weapon theorically intended for medium range, you would hit more than 3 bullets. with the crosshairs perfectly placed on the enemy. wrong, weapons are clearly crippled from where they come from, again, save the world has nothing to do with a competitive shooter. the random cones of fire are still too missleading for any new ( and sometimes experienced ) player.

lastly, fix the 3rd person camera exploit. there are plenty of ways to do that. pick whatever you like. make the camera closer to the avatar so it doesn¬¥t give you such a clear description af what's outside your cone of view. or better, remove all the bulshit for good and go first person, and now start monetizing on weapon skins that are way easier to do because you only need to do textures and not models.

and you know, while we are at it, melee pickaxe dmg could be raised to 34, so at least you have any chance or use with it.

feel free to downvote me because I dislike the current meta.",FortNiteBR

The reason instant editing isn't possible and won't ever be possible, *in my opinion*, is because in a world of instant edits, you'd always run into these big issues: **Pressing 'O' is consoles only way of entering and one of the ways of exiting build mode. Lets say you're looking at your own structure and want to enter build mode. If pressing 'O' means you instantly enter edit mode, when what you're trying to do is build more, you'd be forced to look away from all your builds in order to enter build mode. If you're stuck in a huge build fight with another squad, imagine trying to enter build mode with your own structures all around you. Same goes if you box yourself in and go to place a campfire. With instant edits, it would literally be impossible to enter build mode and place the campfire, because pressing 'O' would keep forcing you into edit mode, as you'd be surrounded by your own builds.**

EPIC has a team of professional individuals that they pay a lot of money to figure out solutions to this stuff. The only viable solution to this problem, which I'm sure they've played around with extensively, is to reduce the time it takes to enter edit mode.

IMO, the only thing I think they could do to take this a step further, is simply let us adjust the time it takes to enter edit mode - so we can decide for ourselves the best and most efficient time possible. But I think reducing the time to enter edit mode is a huge step forward for console players who are looking to make bigger plays.",FortNiteBR

That is why I suggest loadouts. 

https://i.redd.it/dxlc9plsb0n11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

This is how the loadout menu could look like. You have the play random so you randomly get to play with one of your loadouts. We have the different loadouts which can be selected as favourite, and we can make new loadouts.

https://i.redd.it/3f4llqh9c0n11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

When you click New Loadout you get to this page and then you just select the skin, back bling, pickaxe, glider and trail. This is also where you delete your loadout.

https://i.redd.it/677argcsb0n11.jpg

This makes it possible to play different skins but still be matching your character skin with the back bling, pickaxe, glider and trail. I like playing different skins but I want them different skins to match so that is why I think this is a good idea.",FortNiteBR

so let's make this simple:

you have made a free for all game with no matchmaking whatsoever and only one winner.

and you have added a mechanic that will reward veteran players with permanent cover and permanent mobility.

on top of that this type of mobility unlike in other videogames restricts other player's mobility. if some is above you he can deny you getting up.

and to even make it better you made it absurd one sided third person that allows for the most bullshit tactic in shooter history ever that is corner picking. one sided 3rd person is bad enough on it's own, you had to mix it with all this other elements.

here is my 2 cents if you want to make this game accesible for everyone, because at this point it's obvious this is hurting player retention:

first get rid of construction exploit. construction should not be used in combat. AT ALL. it should be only used in order to either setup in a safe place where you know you are safe to build, or used for situational mobility to reach high places. not to spam mobility. resource cap should be at 100 per material. it's absurd being able to carry a whole city in your pocket. my honest opinion is that construction belongs to save the world and should not be in battle royale. but since you insist on keeping it at least don't make the whole fucking game be only about it. 

structures need to be much more vulnerable when constructing, need much longer construction time, and should be pierced with any weapon if not fully constructed.

another nice feature would be programming some code so structures would collapse. I mean if you build a 200 piece castle above only a base of 4 walls, I don't think 4 walls would support the weight of 200.

I draw a example of how I say it should be:

https://i.redd.it/f4wkiez380n11.png

another thing I want to talk about is the weapons. I know you are aware about this because it has been adressed, still it's not enough. you would thought that from a full magazine fired to a target at 10 m with an assault rifle, a weapon theorically intended for medium range, you would hit more than 3 bullets. with the crosshairs perfectly placed on the enemy. wrong,  weapons are clearly crippled from where they come from,  again, save the world has nothing to do with a competitive shooter. the random cones of fire are still too missleading for any  new ( and sometimes experienced ) player.

lastly, fix the 3rd person camera exploit. there are plenty of ways to do that. pick whatever you like. make the camera closer to the avatar so it doesn¬¥t give you such a clear description af what's outside your cone of view. or better,  remove all the bulshit for good and go first person, and now start monetizing on weapon skins that are way easier to do because you only need to do textures and not models. 

and you know, while we are at it, melee pickaxe dmg could be raised to 34, so at least you have any chance or use with the pickaxe.

feel free to downvote me because I dislike the current meta.",FortNiteBR

This isn‚Äôt a meme or a suggestion or anything like that. This is a goodbye. It‚Äôs a goodbye to a game that had mine and others‚Äô attention for almost a year now.

I‚Äôve been playing Fortnite since Season 1, but I really got invested in Season 3 when I bought the Battle Pass for the first time. I‚Äôd do the weekly challenges as soon as they‚Äôd release and I‚Äôd have a blast doing them. It was this way moving forward all the way to mid-season 5, when I noticed I wasn‚Äôt having much fun anymore. I decided to put the game down and come back to it later to finish up my battle pass. Today, two weeks later, I hop onto Fortnite to complete the Getaway challenges and finally get to tier 100. As I was playing, I noticed the challenges felt less like a fun task and more like a chore. I noticed I was just getting annoyed at them. I realized that Fortnite just wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. Once I got to tier 100, I did what me from February would‚Äôve never did. I uninstalled Fortnite.

As a Call of Duty Zombies fan, the gap between maps is terribly long, especially when you have nothing to play between releases. Fortnite solved that issue. Fortnite filled that gap and made my life so much better. I have so many good memories from Fortnite, but Black Ops 4 comes out in 3 weeks. I have 4 new Zombies maps to play. Once I get bored of those, I‚Äôll have Red Dead 2. Once I get bored of that, I‚Äôll have Smash Ultimate and Just Cause 4. Fortnite just doesn‚Äôt have a place in my life anymore.

I know Epic devs closely follow this subreddit, so I just wanted to thank everyone there for making an incredible, fully fledged, FREE game. Thank you for giving me something to do when I was feeling down, and thank you for making me have to buy a new controller ;)

Fortnite is an amazing game and is definitely the best free game on the market. Anyone who hates Fortnite strictly because of its popularity obviously haven‚Äôt played it for themselves. Maybe then they would‚Äôve realized WHY it‚Äôs so popular. Anyway, this post is way longer than I wanted it to be. Thank you Fortnite for everything you‚Äôve done for me, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how you wrap up Season 5.

Smg - i have seen the dps on gold P90, its lower than blue silenced smg. Why is that? So the blue sil smg the best smg in the game after the drum gun is gone? I think green silenced smg is better than p90 too coz of high dps. Should I look at only DPS of a gun or is there anything else that I am missing?
Shotgun - what I have seen is tactical shotgun is good close range with high dps.
Heavy shotgun is good medium range which is the reason why I pick it up over the pump shotgun.
Pump shptgun is really good. I love it but it hits really bad sometimes maybe coz it has high damage so devs made it miss a little. So I prefer using heavy if I get one.

My issue is I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong anymore it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve hit a point  where it‚Äôs hard and frustrating to learn because of it? Idek how to explain it it, 

I don‚Äôt get how I can be as fast as Tfue or someone while building, I thought I was already at max speed sprinting whole way, I don‚Äôt get how to get high kill games consistently.

And no video ever really helps considering most of the ‚Äútips‚Äù are clickbait 10 min vids or vids that just explain common knowledge.

Can someone help me find someone that makes guides that aren‚Äôt exactly beginner guides and can help someone like me. 

And yes, I do indeed want to be the sweatiest player in the lobby, I can aim and build decently fast but it‚Äôs just things like getting even faster, high kill rotations, better decision making that I need work on.

Any help is appreciated.

Hi, thank you in advance for any suggestions.

5 days ago I got off of work, came home and attempted to fire up Fortnite. I thought it was odd when i clicked the shortcut on my desktop to bypass the Epic launcher and load straight into the game, that Fortnite actually closed and went to the launcher login screen and asked me to input my password. When I did so, it popped up with an error saying my account has been disabled due to the possible reasons being the owner has asked for the account to be deactivated or the account has been banned. I immediately thought I had been hacked and someone deactivated my account. So i emailed the support and had to verify my identity, I then get a response that I had been banned because I ""have been observed cheating"". The response seemed pretty automated so I replied saying what anyone in my situation would do. ""I have not cheated, there is no way you have observed me cheating because i have absolutely not cheated, if i was going to cheat on a free game, why would i just not create a smurf account for free and use that one to cheat"" and so on, i got the same exact response back to that message as the first time, so i literally dont know what to do at this point. I have spent upwards of $200 on Fortnite and have spent an ungodly amount of time playing the game. To be banned from a game that I absolutely enjoy, when I have done nothing wrong, is a horrible feeling. So, if anyone has any suggestions as to what I should do, i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.

Welcome to **GAME THEORY** the show that switched from actual science and math, to stupid theories about fictional realities.

A common question on the internet is ""If X is so good, why isn't there X2?"" And yeah it's a pretty funny joke. But then I did the ""research!""

If Fortnite is so good, as a global smash hit, why isn't there a Fortnite 2?

But there's already a number in the name, Four-tnite.

What comes after 4? **5**

Fivetnite, sounds familiar doesn't it? Well that's because Fortnite is actually a prequal to **Five Nights At Freddy's**

It just makes sense, the furry/scalie animal outfits. The lack of any realistic lore. Even the S5 theme of time travel makes sense.

This is not coming from EPIC, this is just a post made by me from the experiences I have had and the methods which I have tried. These seem to fix my issues and hopefully yours too. All the information is what I personally have gathered and compiled here. 

If you do not feel comfortable modifying anything stated below, have limited computer experience or the PC you play on does not belong to you, then please **do not attempt to try this.**

#Overview
After recent testing on different methods to try and fix or at least drastically reduce the performance issues people are having after the v5.30 update, I have come up with a list of possible solutions which should help the majority of people fix these issues.

#Common performance issues:

* FPS Hitches (dropping to very low frames for a short time).
* Some UE4 Crashes (Mainly the ones which log 'timed out while waiting for GPU to catch up' and 'Error: Leaving stat scope on hitch'). This information can be found on the detailed log file located in the crash folder. The most common place which this can be found is in the following path -  C:\Users\""your windows login name""\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Crashes\ - Then open the very recent crash folder and open FortniteGame.log scroll near the bottom and look for the errors i stated above. [**Screenshot for reference**](https://imgur.com/a/wCPqlSQ).
* 100% usage on GPU/CPU/Disk
* Other FPS lag/spikes.

#Fixes you can try:

* **Defrag all hard disks.** You can do this by right clicking your hard disk, click properties, go to Tools, Click Optimise, select your hard disk, then click 'Optimise'. It should start analysing and then defragging. [**Screenshot for reference**](https://imgur.com/a/X1f1Rca). *Note: this will not work with SSD's*
* **Verify game integrity files.** Sometimes files may get corrupted so verify your files from the Epic games Launcher. [**Screenshot for reference**](https://imgur.com/a/R7ekaBS).
* **Update your graphics drivers.** You can do this by searching up ""Graphics drivers for x"" (x being your graphics card). Download the most recent ones online or you can use your graphics drivers software updater which may be already installed on your pc. If you do not know your graphics card chip set you can press 'windows key + R' and type 'dxdiag'. Run that and navigate to Display 1. Look for 'Chip Type' and that's what you need to get drivers for. [**Screenshot for reference**](https://imgur.com/a/EXLFV34).
* **Update your CPU drivers.** You can do this by searching up ""CPU drivers for x"" (x being your CPU type). Download the most recent ones online. If you do not know your graphics card chip set you can press 'windows key + R' and type 'dxdiag'. Run that and navigate to System. Look for 'Processor' and that's what you need to get drivers for. [**Screenshot for reference**](https://imgur.com/a/DCMe9c4).
* **Lower your resolution.** You can try just lowering your resolution in-game just a small amount each time and test if it helps.
* **Keep your game open for up to an hour.** I don't know why but some people report that just leaving your game open for up to an hour on the lobby screen and then playing after that allows for smoother gameplay.
* Finally this is a big one which helps mostly with crashes and big FPS spikes. **Turn off any overclock settings.** If you have overclocked and set an overclock profile it seems that it can mess with the game. Try just turning them off or create a temporary profile with no settings tweaked and the crashes should stop and gameplay should be smoother. 

Please bear in mind that as the game updates it will require more powerful systems to run. If your hardware is outdated or your specs do not match the recommended requirements then your issue may just be to update your PC hardware and there may not be any other software fixes. You can look to see if your PC matches the recommended requirements [here.](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/fortnite/15349)

I hope this helps as many people as possible. Please comment below if this has helped or if you have any other fixes which may help others. I will try to answer as many questions as possible that you all may have.",FortNiteBR

(It can be fired after loading in 1 shell for half damage, but if 2 shells are in the gun they will both fire at the same time.)

Keep 143/150 base damage and spread.

Headshot multiplier increased from 1.25 to 1.5.
Full headshot damage would be 214.5 and 225.
(Keep in mind the double barrel has a very wide spread and quick damage fall off, so hitting a shot worth over 200 would have to be a skilled barrel stuff to the face with only 1 chance.) It would still be worthy of its rarity due to its high base damage and 1 tap potential. 

I‚Äôve spend some time thinking about how to balance the double barrel better and this is what I came up with. It‚Äôs how I envisioned the sawed off when it was first announced. I was disappointed to see it be released as body shot gun that can do close to 300dps! That‚Äôs way higher than every other gun in the game. I‚Äôd rather they re-work it, than remove it completely.

But then people found out how to build ik begin season 3, which made the game even more fun, we had a balance between building forts and having build battles, but building forts became slightly harder when epic added in the launchpad, you could still hide in a base but people could easily get in your base or get really close because of it, which made the base useless.

S4 was just a mess, I honestly forgot what got added but it messed everything up, I think this was the season where jumppads and impulse grenades got added, they made it really easy to get upclose to players to then have stupid shotgun and build battles.

And s5 is just the same but worse with dumbass smg‚Äôs

TL;DR launchpads impulse grenades etc ruined the oldschool playstyle which everyone loved, they support close range fights and also makes the storm completely useless.",FortNiteBR

They usually mess around in Playground together and shoot each other stealing each other epics or legendary weapons. My oldest plays on my 2nd PC next to me while the other plays on the Xbox behind us in the den. 

The oldests asks me, ""Dad, can I have V-bucks"". I say that he is too young for them right now on a free random account. He looks a bit sad. I've already taught him well enough to use the keyboard and mouse, and he actually prefers it. So I said to him, ""If you can get 1 consistent kill per match, I'll buy you V-bucks"". He just really wants a costume.

So this weekend I decided to let the kid play on my main account thats tied to my credit card. I don't play Fortnite much anymore, but I have a few costumes on there from Battlepacks and Amazon Prime. I was taking care of all 3 boys (also have a 1 year old) that night, and ran upstairs to get a bottle to feed the baby. When I was gone for those 10 minutes of feeding time, he purchased 2 separate purchases on V-bucks for $200 USD. Mind you use Canadian Moosebucks so tack on 30%.

I emailed Epic support and every single time they had turned me down for a refund. They said they do not refund a digital good such as V-bucks. I absolutely cannot believe this policy. It is not right and not fair. It's not fair to consumers of digital goods. There is no way in hell a company should hold so much power over a purchase you made. As a consumer we should have the right to not be happy with out purchase and be issued a refund immediately in certain circumstances like this.

I don't know what else to do. I could issue a charge back which may work (I've never done it). What other avenues do I have?? ",FortNiteBR

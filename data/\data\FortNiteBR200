My closest friend, has severe arachnophobia, more specifically he’s deathly afraid of spiders, no matter in what shape or form, even something as innocent as Lucas the Spider. He refuses to go near any bathrooms in his house if only one has a spider, even the smallest one, that’s how scared he is of spiders.

It should be common knowledge to many as of now (and if not here’s some news), but the Fortnite is getting decoration changes for Halloween such as ghosts, pumpkins, and of course spiders. To see how he’d react, I took him to the house in Pleasant and asked how he felt seeing them. He was terrified and would not get back on his keyboard until I destroyed them.

This does sound similar to the clown case now that I think of it, but Epic. Please don’t add more spiders to the map or at least not very many for the sake of those with arachnophobia such as my friend, he would love to enjoy the game completely, but it would be difficult if they were scattered across POIs. It would ruin the game for a while for him and many others out there suffering his issue.

Also yes, he has gotten medical assistance and has been exposed/trying to slowly overcome his phobia, we have been playing some Hunt: Showdown for brief periods to help him progress one step at a time.

tl;dr: My friend has severe arachnophobia and wouldn’t be able to play the game if spiders as Halloween decorations were put around the map.",FortNiteBR

4 days later and still no skin and no V Bucks, and I'm not getting the V bucks because I found out that it was only if you purchased it from the Samsung store. 
I feel scammed by Samsung, I know their not intentionally scamming people. But still their ad was a major factor in determining which phone I bought.  I could've got last year's model for about 150 cheaper. So the $100 worth of V bucks would  have offset the cost.

First and foremost, I would like to begin by saying that yes, I am well aware that a lot of people aren’t even going to click on this post, or even take the time to read all the way to the end. Still, I’ve wanted to talk about this for quite some time but was worried of the backlash that might follow, but now that we’re this far into Fortnite’s existence, I guess that’s the right word, I figured this might help further stop “account scammers” from continuing to sell their accounts.

Now, as most of you may or may not know, there is a large portion of players who started playing Fortnite in the middle of Season 3, with myself included. I kept seeing people with certain skins (Black Knight, Blue Squire, etc.) and dance emotes (The Floss, Ride the Pony, The Worm, etc.) that looked pretty cool and made me want to figure out how to obtain them. Sadly, like everyone else, I discovered that I had started playing too late, and that I was unable to ever earn these items. I decided to suck it up and just casually play the game as is, and since then, I have earned all of the rewards from the Battle Passes since then.

Then came all of the posts on Twitter. I kept seeing posts of people selling their accounts and people begging for the Black Knight, among other skins, to come back. I would just casually pass them by and pay no attention, but they still persisted on, and made me question what they expected the outcome to be. I even saw that some people would actually buy these accounts and get permanently banned all because they wanted a certain skin to use. 

Then I thought of an idea while playing through Season 4; what if there were a way to help bring all of these rewards back in a reasonable way and further stop account scammers from getting their way? That’s when I came up with what I like to call: 

Season 2 Packs 1 &amp; 2

Here’s how all of this would work:

· Pack 1 would contain all cosmetic rewards from Tiers 1-35

· Pack 2 would contain all cosmetic rewards from Tiers 36-70

· Both packs would not include the free seasonal XP or free V-Bucks

· Both packs would also include whatever items were included in the Free Pass as well

· Both packs would be priced at 5,000 V-Bucks 

· Each pack can be available for two weeks before switching to the next one

· Each pack would be made available once per season

· The three Fort Knights skins would also come with their respective back bling as well

· All banners, pickaxes, gliders, and additional emotes would be included in their respective packs

· To add fairness, both packs would only be available to people that did NOT initially purchase the Season 2 Battle Pass, meaning that if you did buy it at some point and not get all the rewards, you already had your chance

Now this isn’t meant to be seen as a helpless cry to Epic demanding that the Season 2 skins be brought back just because I want them. This is simply meant to be seen as a potentially successful way in not only pleasing the newer players that missed out on these rewards but to also further stop account scams from continuing. 

I’m already expecting a lot of people to not even read this whole post and tell me that it’ll never happen, that it should only be with the OGs, that Epic would never stoop so low, and so on; or maybe they will read the whole thing and still say it. I’m just trying to reach out to everyone and say that yes, I know that these skins were meant to be exclusive, but with these scams still persisting, this could potentially be a gigantic step in the right direction to ensure that everyone who plays Fortnite can be happy and play the game the way they want to without running the risk of getting banned.

Thank you taking the time to read this. If you by any chance have any questions about something I might not have gone over, please post it below, and I will try to get back to you with an answer as soon as possible.

There actually was variety to loadouts which is what epic even said they wanted to do but turned the game into everyone with a shotgun, smg, and a heavy sniper and scar.

Back then double pump was still a thing so players with good flick aim could use it and SMGS were useful cause they’d been buffed so players with better tracking aim could use that.

I don’t wanna hear anyone tell me DP back then was broken. I thought it was balanced back then and if someone was using it, and you got destroyed by it I want you to know either 

1. You didn’t build so you would’ve died anyways, they can’t spam through a structure like SMGS do

2. The player had good aim and headshotted you.

Yes maybe 10 was too much so the timer would be good if only activated after 4 shots so you couldn’t continuously do that even though just building up would stop it tbh.

And smg and pump still has a way bigger dps and shreds builds",FortNiteBR

Yes skull/ghoul trooper were store items, but I feel that they should not come back even for Halloween. 

Fortnite BR was just beginning its rise to fame last October. That means many of us were not around for the initial release of the original Halloween troopers. Let Epic keep it that way, instead lets look forward to the new Halloween themed skins and keep seeing skull/ghoul trooper on rare occasions. If Epic were to sell skull/ghoul trooper again we would see it in every match and it would lose what makes it unique now.  

Power Chord is a recent example that I can think of that lost its charm once it came back. I like many other fans bought it upon its return to the store, but once I started to see it over and over again in game I began to understand why I liked it so much when I didn't have it. It was because seeing it on a rare occasion was like finding a relic of the games past.

If Epic brings back Skull/Ghoul trooper it means that once the Christmas holidays come people are going to expect the re-release of those skins as well and once again those skins will lose that unique charm that they carry with them. 

tl;dr - Let's keep some items unique and have some older items be a nod back to the game before it became the monster hit it is today.

The P90 was never a good addition to the game, neither was the smg update, or removing the bouncers, or adding the boogie bomb, or adding a machine gun, or more splash structure damage from grenades etc.  
I beg Epic remove the BS guns, Fortnite is slowly becoming less and less fun, S5 had a solid map rotation and was a lot of fun after the smg nerf, the season got me hooked, everything was so fun, but the new season ruined the map rotation, the meta, and a lot of the fun.  
Also, the double barrel shotgun should be removed or vaulted and the tactical shotgun shouldn't deal damage more than the pump.

But epic did good removing the drum gun IMO.

I feel like the game is becoming more luck based.

And it’s not even that, bloom is still an issue and first shot accuracy ain’t gonna do crap, and also smg’s are still overpowered (not as much as before but still overpowered) and despite all the backlash from the games most popular players they STILL don’t address most of this.

That’s great for all the suckers who want to spend money on meaningless crap, but you’d think you’d work on keeping your player base in tact for as long as possible. I personally can’t stand season 6 so far, only because I’ve been playing since season 2, and I wanted them to blow up the entire map or something major in order to keep me interested. I’m getting bored with Fortnite and am playing it less and less all the time now. I doubt I’m the only one. 

It’s all good for all the little kids because they have short attention spans, any colourful skin will please them and displease their mommy’s credit cards. But for the adults, come on EPIC, this is all you got? I’m so disappointed. I bet you BO4 gets a new map before Fortnite at this rate. 

Wow corn fields grew corn, and the already existing house in Loot is now flying up high, and there’s some ghosts and Halloween shit around them. Oh and Wailin’ is so amazing now right! That’s so interesting /s. I saw it all in the first hour of the season. Nothing major at all, can’t even get the new shadow stones to work properly. 

The point is, you’re about to lose a huge chunk of your player base, and likely it will be the ones who spend the most money. As most the adults are the ones who have jobs and can afford their own skins. So what’s the deal with all the subpar  minor changes around the map that got boring after an hour? You’d think a billion dollar company would increase the expenditure to keep their player base around. Oh well, prepare to get destroyed by realistic horse balls shrinking in the cold.

Anybody else counting the days until Red Dead 2 is out?",FortNiteBR
136,TheDanielKemp,1538514372,9kumyl,23,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9kumyl/theory_the_tunnels_in_the_underground_wailing/,1,"[THEORY] The tunnels in the underground Wailing Woods lab are not tunnels, they're portals (or soon to be portals).","Hey everyone. Just a quick theory that sprung to mind as I was exploring the main lab under Wailing Woods. I had a look around to see if anyone had posted such a theory before but apart from that one post about a character from STW who made rifts, I didn't really see any other theories like this. Sorry if I missed anything, I did look.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we all know about the underground lab by now, and we all know about the tunnels. Most people seem to think these tunnels will be dug out further until they connect with the similar tunnels under the four houses surrounding the lab. However, I don't think this is the case. Let's take a look at what could really be going on.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, [the rift](https://i.imgur.com/5sN0nZx.png). This one's pretty obvious. The people who set up this lab seem to be studying the rift, most likely to understand what it is, how it works, and possibly even how to recreate it. Most people have probably figured this out by now.

&amp;#x200B;

So where do the tunnels come into play? Well, I, like many others, simply assumed they'd just be dug out until they were all connected, until the other day when I paid closer attention to [this](https://i.imgur.com/exAfbN6.png) tunnel in particular. This is the tunnel just in front of the rift. What's interesting about this tunnel is that, unlike all the others, [it is completely open and still inside the lab on the other side](https://i.imgur.com/ZYuwLiZ.png). Note the massive generators and what appear to be ventilation shafts - though they could actually be some kind of power conduits - obviously meant to be powering something. Clearly there's no way a tunnel could be dug out from here. This is what lead me to believe that the ""tunnels"" are actually going to be portals. Like the rifts, only man-made and more controlled, probably travelling to and from the tunnels in the other houses.

&amp;#x200B;

Further evidence supporting this theory can actually be seen in every tunnel, in the lab and in the houses. [They all have a very intentional back wall](https://i.imgur.com/yOKadlx.png). If they were gonna be dug out into tunnels, wouldn't they look more like [this](https://i.imgur.com/FhUmMGX.png)? Further, what would even be the point of literal tunnels spanning from the lab to these random houses around the Woods? What would that accomplish? There's nothing else in the houses that would suggest the (what I assume are) scientists ever *need* to be there, much less get there through secret underground tunnels. It makes sense, however, if they were just using the hidden sections under the houses simply to test the rift technology they are developing, as all they need is a location to teleport to or from. Further supporting this is the fact that houses are quite clearly ""cover stories"", for lack of a better phrase, [as you can see in the main lab all the various props and furniture used to construct these decoy houses](https://i.imgur.com/zKmuMjH.png). Plus, the houses are literally [within walking and even viewing distance of each other](https://i.imgur.com/O8GZTDq.png). You wouldn't need tunnels to travel between them.

&amp;#x200B;

As a bonus point, just for fun, [there's also a painting or photo of the old factories at Dusty Depot in the main lab](https://i.imgur.com/UsO9Fg7.png). Could be nothing but ... maybe someone misses pre-meteor Dusty, and maybe, just maybe, the rift technology is not only for travelling through space, but also for travelling through time. It would even make sense as the giant rift in the sky brought objects and locations from many different time periods. Something to think about.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The scientists at the Wailing Woods lab are developing rift technology, and the ""tunnels"" aren't tunnels at all, but will be used to test this technology by teleporting back and forth between the main lab and the decoy houses. This may or may not also involve time travel.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading. Sorry it was so long. If you made it to the end, I really appreciate it. I know this is obvious, but it needs to be said: Anything and everything I've said here is 100% theory and speculation. Nothing I have suggested might happen is fact, nor should it be taken as such. Any and all of what I've said could be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again.",FortNiteBR

Throwback Battlepasses

&amp;#x200B;

Based on when your epic games account was registered, you have a option to buy a throwback battlepass, this is for users that may have missed out, or just werent able to get everything, the throwback battlepass allows users to buy a certain seasonal battlepass, though the battlepasses that you can buy are limited to your account registration date, like if you signed up in season 1, you can buy all the battlepasses up to the current one. (you cant buy season 1 battlepass through it tho.)

Balance options: (note they are just ideas for what could be done to balance it out, they arent all made to be in the finished product if its in btw.)

&amp;#x200B;

1: Extending battlepass tiers to 150, with no extra rewards, and to make it slightly more fair for the people who originally got the battlepasses.

2: Subscription style system, players pay a certain amount each week or month to use the battlepass.

3: The account registration date system as previously said above, the system detects when the user was active on fortnite and their registration date, and then gives the user the option to buy the throwback battlepass of whatever season that their account has been through, for example, if someone has played season 1, they would be able to purchase all of the seasonal battlepasses, but if its a season 4, they would only be able to buy up from season 4, 5, 6 and so forth till the current season.

4: Make it cost more money than a regular battlepass.

&amp;#x200B;

The throwback battlepass would have a unique icon, upon purchasing you will see a animation of a battle star filled with rift energy implode on itself and then it says Throwback Battlepass Activated!

I'm pretty sure epic did a Bungie on us by adding matchmaking with players at the same or similar skill level. I went further with that and went to replay on one of my matches and checked 100 player stats. 57% of the lobby had 400 wins at least, which is insane when you think about it 23% had 200+ and 20% had 100+ not even one person had less than 100 wins in total.

After that I made a new account and played 1 solo game, after the game I checked all player stats: this time only 36% of players had more than 150 wins highest being 134 total wins on the guy that won. 46% was under 100 and 18% had less than 50 wins. All these wins are overall lifetime wins if anyone is asking. The reason I said epic pulled a Bungie on us is that Bungie implemented skill-based matchmaking to destiny without letting the player base know. I know that I could have done more research with the matches, but trust me. Checking 200 profiles takes quite some time. Remember that this is just my theory, I decided to do this experiment because of all the posts about the game being hard in the current season.

My name is QTVain, and I’m a lifelong gamer. As well as being a gamer, I’m a dad, husband and full-time Air Traffic Controller. Generally, I get about 2-4 hours in every night of play time when everyone goes to sleep, and I wake up the next day at 6 to get ready for work. 

As most of you have, I’ve grinded this game since last November. I’ve spent hours analyzing my gameplay, watching streams on break, partaking in scrims, and spending time in playgrounds to work on myself mechanically. If I could commit more time to playing, I would, but my family life will always come first.

This November I’m having my second kid; my first son, and my wife and I are extremely excited. Unfortunately, come that time, I may have to hang up Fortnite. It’s been my lifelong dream to compete as a professional in video games. I’ve been watching Esports since it involved those cheap, foldout picnic tables at LANs. I’m 28 now, and I worry I have a limited timeframe to compete. I love my job, but if there’s anything in this life I would choose to do, it’s compete and have my work life be involved with video games.

The entire premise of this message, is to ask if this community can help get me an invite to the pro discord on a trial period to compete. To see if I have what it takes, and to see if I can continue to pursue this passion before my son is born. I know that this will seem unfair to some of you. There are people that grinded 16+ hour days to get in, and there are people that continue to grind that should be able to get in, that aren’t. I get it. I realize what I’m asking for here is a handout. Just know that it isn’t my intention to discredit your work. Unfortunately, I can’t compete in FNPL and climb the ladder. By the time I get off work, and get my kid to sleep the league is about down, and I wouldn’t have been warmed up at all. I don’t have the money to spend on flying out to a tournament (I’m in the south). All I have is my daily grind to improve myself, and you guys right now.

I’ve gotten many 20+ kill solo squads and duos (in this season), I’ve got a 45+% WR and 10KD in solos, I’ve competed in and won solo snipes. Every single death and loss is a challenge for me to analyze what went wrong. Even with my limited play time I’m competing at this level, and I truly believe that if given the chance, I could compete with the best. I’m just asking for this community to bring this post to light so that those in charge of the pro discord can see it. All I’m asking for is a trial. I’m not asking for a Skirmish or tournament invite. I would just like to be given a chance before I ever have to ask that “what if” question.

Please, from the bottom of my heart know that I don’t want to anger anyone here. I don’t mean to discredit anything you’ve done. I grinded through the military to get where I am now in my daily job, and I understand the pain and struggle. I hope y’all understand. 

It feels weird asking for a handout and being so vulnerable with y’all. I fully expect to be shot down. If anything, thanks for reading.

#The start

 I can see that some people dont like the skin. But about few months ago i started seeing comments on youtube, twitter and instagram. They were mostly saying ""Ghoul trooper &gt; Skull trooper"" which is understandable and harmless. But people in the replies started to trash talk skull trooper and stuff like that and it got really wild.

#The spread

 Alot of people realised these comments got alot of attention, so they posted it too. After some time it was on every single video, post or tweet. It got rudiculous.

#The reason

 Everyone wants go get that like, right? It just feels great. I understand that, but posting the same thing under every video you watch isnt okay.

#The hate

 It got so spread it couldnt be stopped. Alot of people fell into it and started mindlessly follow these guys. Skull trooper is hated more than ever before which hurts my soul. He is the dad of skins. He was probably the first popular skin in the game. Everyone loved him. He also made this game more popular. Maybe if he wasnt ever released, the game wouldnt be popular as much or maybe you wont ever even play it. Or you wont be using your new awesome skin you wanted to buy all long and finally got it.

#The end
 
 Im not crying or anything. No salt included. What I meant to say with this post is that it hurts my soul. He got all this hate cause he was popular. Everything that gets popular is hated, I understand, but this is just a harmless goofy looking skeleton skin. I dont understand people thesd days. Im sorry, but it just makes me sad. If you made it this far, congrats, you have a cookie 🍪. Now respect skull trooper, you have this cookie only thanks to him

*TLDR :* So it started on ytb, twitter and instagram, people said they hate skull and love ghoul to be unique and get attention. Started harmless, but got spread cause everyone wants that sweet feeling of getting likes. It got out of hand and got spread way too much and our poor goofy skeleton dude is getting alot of hate cause people mindlessly follow these comments and posts. No salt, just sad that this community is like this.

If you want to hate, yell, or anything at me, please dont, I didnt mean to offend anyone by this post. If that is the case, Im sorry.

I can see that some people dont like the skin. But about few months ago i started seeing comments on youtube, twitter and instagram. They were mostly saying ""Ghoul trooper &gt; Skull trooper"". (Some people like ghoul more, understandble, but this wasnt the purpose) What they ment to do, was to be against everyones opinons. They wantey to get attention by being unique in an annoying way, and they got tons of likes by the same people. It got spread out wuickly cause people want attention. It got way worse until its on like every post on these medias. Its disgusting. About last month when people started to talk about rerelease theye comments got into reddit. Now whenever you see a skull/ghoul trooper post, there are alot of comments saying ghoul is better, not just that, they spread the hate on skin. They talk about it like its the worse skin in the fortnite history. Like if they just said their opinions. No. They have to also want everyone to see they hate skull trooper to be UNIQUE. Skull trooper is a great skin and I dont understand all this stuff people do.

*TLDR :* So it started on ytb, twitter and instagram, people said they hate skull and love ghoul to be unique and get attention. This got spread out to everywere and people just hate on skull trooper and they dont even know why. It got spread way too much and skull is now getting alot of hate by these kind of people.

If that is the case, Epic if youre reading this i want you to understand something....

THE WHOLE THING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT RELEASE GHOUL TROOPER TOO.

if they release the skull trooper everyone will buy it but no one will have ghoul trooper. And by doing that the ghoul trooper will become the last og skin remaining and the account selling will change from selling the skull trooper to the ghoul trooper.

My name is ItsCrucifix and I have been playing fortnite in console and pc since its release. I’ve found that my pc can’t really run the game very well anymore and have made the full switch to console.

I used to be able to get a few wins every day. I would be able to win my gun fights and take advantage of the terrain. I could drop in just about any location and walk out alive with a couple kills. 

Lately, it seems almost impossible to win. I cant ever seem to hit shots, even though my crosshair will fully cover other players. I cant really be that unlucky with bloom in every single fight, can I? (Side note, i do take advantage if first-shot accuracy and try to stay crouched when possible. Smaller crosshair=greater accuracy). It seems like other people can move around all the want and still manage to hit every shot, I just don’t get it.

Dont even get me started with shotguns. I see everyone complaining about how they hit a headshot for 7 damage, yet I never see this happen to people. Whenever I get into a fight with a shotgun, I will hit for 7-15 damage, yet get one shot every single time. Kinda strange how we all have the same problem, don’t ya think?

I also don’t understand how people are building so fast on console. I use combat pro, have always used it and am used to it. I have seen people say switch to builder pro, but I just don’t understand it. You have to click to select a piece then click again to place it. How is double clicking any faster than just switching with bumpers? I guess I just don’t understand builder pro. 

How can I improve? I’m in a weird spot where I can comprehend the game. I understand what is going on and how to play. I understand you don’t need to take high ground to win, but it “supposedly” makes it much easier. (Side note, even when i have high ground, it seems like i just get built right over and lose the fight. Dont understand how everyone is so good at building).

I prefer to play the stealth game. I perform better when i hide it out till the end. I just can never seem to win a fight anymore. I either get lasered (no matter how far away they are. I seem to get lasered from halfway across the map) or i get stomped in a build fight and die. 

I know it’s illogical to assume everybody is a god now, so clearly there is something that I am missing or doing wrong. 

I encourage all tips. If you were in a similar spot, how did you overcome it? If you think I should change my playstyle, teach me how. If i just need to practice more, what should I be working on and how? I’m looking for constructive criticism. 

For a final side note, I know there are guides for this kind of thing all over the place, but I can never find any solid info, just people fighting about pc vs console. I dont even know if I am supposed to be posting this in this subreddit, but here we are anyways. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

I can't believe that there is a development team, based in USA, that's filled with so unintelligent individuals, who lack any common sense or knowledge regarding basic weaponary and movement.  


When you run, especially at top speed, you move way faster than you walk, and that's how you want to run in a game, based on RUNNING AWAY from the storm, right? HA, THEY DON'T KNOW IT.  


When you use a shotgun, you are dealing a devastating damage from shells that splash when fired, pretty much penetrating anything in sight. HA, THEY DON'T KNOW IT.  


When you drive, most cars, even the golf car available in the game, it, believe it or not, moves actually way faster than 10 kilometers per hour, but... HA, THEY DON'T KNOW IT.  


When you are not cheating, you are not to be put in a match where 80 other players are, you should, instead, be put in a balanced match with well-behaved players. HA, THEY DON'T KNOW IT.  


When you build anything from pure fucking metal, it is not going to be demolished within a few 9mm SMG bullets, instead, it could take up to few explosives to be destroyed. HA, THEY DON'T KNOW IT.  


When you are free-falling, you should be in able to decide where you open your parachute (or glider in this case), not to have the game to open it for you, just to have someone land at your location. HA, THEY DON'T KNOW.  


Is it possible that you get more than 50 people working at the game, and noone sees any of these flaws? Like what the heck is going on? People are selling you fucking fog. Quit being so simple minded.  


Epic does not care about any of you, no matter how many battle royales you got, or eliminations, or anything really, they want their pockets filled, that's why they released the game for every single platform, so every single platform can keep feeding them money.  


As for the end, I really hope I get my dick sucked. :)

This isn’t meant to be a fortnite is dying type post but i truly want to know why people still play. During the last few weeks of season 5 i found myself falling off from the game and hardly played anymore. The game doesn’t seem that fun anymore to me. I bought the battle pass and now i feel like i have to play to get tier 100 since i already bought it. I was kind of hyped for season 6 but it just hasn’t been doing it for me. Like i said rn I’m only playing because i bought battle pass and a few friends still play. Even when talking to friends they made the same points that they aren’t enjoying the game anymore. I don’t know if this is just because we’re older then the average fortnite player and we have grown out of it but the game definitely isn’t the same. At my job we have little fortnite events for kids and people don’t even show up for it anymore and they have said they don’t come because it’s not fun anymore. (for 9-13 year olds i believe)

* **Issue:** So I downloaded the new season 6 update with joy and excitement only to find out that it would crash after seconds or if I'm lucky minutes. (It does not happen in-game, but randomly in the menu/lobby only). This kind of crash forces me to shut off or restart my PC. What happens is: **1:** My monitor turns black, I can still hear in-game audio and other programs running in the background,  I cannot Alt-Tab nor Ctrl-Alt-Del. **2:** ""No Signal"" sign occurs on my monitor, I can still hear in-game audio and other programs. **3:** The green light on my monitor turns yellow (which is an indication that my monitor is on but my PC isn't) and eventually I cannot hear audio although my PC is still on, fans spinning, and LED's working intentionally. After a few seconds or maybe minutes (i'ts random) my PC automatically restarts itself if I haven't already turned it off or restarted it by pressing the button on the case. Now the thing is, it has also started happening in (sorry to say) PUBG just after i downloaded the update, BUT only when Fortnite is installed. 
* **Troubleshooting performed:** Verify game cache. Delete, then reinstall game. Reset BIOS to default. Reset MSI Afterburner to default. Check for Windows, Nvidia-Geforce and BIOS updates and updated all 3 to latest. Windows 10 troubleshoot automatic start-up repair/diagnosis. Checked for overheating. None of these things worked, and my CPU nor my GPU are overheating :(
* And yes, my PC does have the recommended specs.

1. We are only looking for INFORMATION. Yes, the Switch career stats would be dope. However there is no use in lingering with am answer. Its beem several months. Some info is better than no info.

2. Stats help better get better. It is a fact that having defined metrics to measure results in overall improvement across the average player. I hear that stats on Mobile and Switch are implemented because the overall player skill is lower than PC, but that bears fallacy. A subset of Fortnite players should not go without because itw perceived their stats are lower than PC, and thus they'll get discouraged. You know what would accurately determine Mobile and Switch player skill levels? A stats page. The option to not display would be an easy fix.

3. Stat tracking is fundamental across multiplayer games and should be accessible to thoses who may not own a suitable gaming computer. 

4. Transparency in games is a godsend. Epic has been fairly open and quick in implementing patches to the game for better player experience. Some Switch players have fantastic experiences playing Fortnite on the go, which is essentially free publicity for the game. Why not make the experience shared across systems? I understand the replays not being available on Switch because Epic GAVE US INFORMATION. So I ask you Epic, please, for transparency's sake and respect to all your Switch / Mobile fans, give us some information as to the status of this request.

Thank you for making a dope ass game.",FortNiteBR

bringing these outfits back to the item shop will help Epic games alot since this move is not only gonna help them get more money but at the same time tackle the problem of people scaming other people/kids for fake account that they claim to have these outfits.

When you get in these crazy build fights and you only have a .5 second window to shoot, and your shotgun hits him for 17 damage, and his P90 can hit you for more than that, I really struggle to see how this is something Epic wanted for the game. 
In my opinion, the double pump with the now reduced damage of shotguns would reward players with high accuracy who manage to hit headshots.
The counter option to this would be to buff shotgun damage again, but I can’t see epic games wanting to do this after all the months they have spent nerfing it.

359,ReligiousAnimal,1538471812,9kp3pj,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9kp3pj/traps/,1,Traps,"This isnt a complaint whatsoever. I dont mind how the traps are now. I just think they should be changed a bit considering their green rarity, ease of use, and very high damage output.

Current trap: 150 damage, unlimited stacking, can place on most surfaces excluding natural terrain and enemy builds, very common as floor loot, instantly triggerable upon placing, very little experience to understand its uses.

Possible change: Make traps also able to damage the person who placed it IF an enemy triggers it while you are within the trap's reach. 

No, you wouldn't be able to trigger it by yourself. This would prevent players from getting really, really easy kills just by simply placing a trap on the player while they are fighting in shotgun range. It seems it is just as easy, if not easier, to place a trap mid shotgun fight and deal 150 damage instantly. This would force players to be more strategic about their trap placements in a fight.

Possible change 2: revert back to the lower (75?,100?) damage traps. 

To survive the current traps, you HAVE to have 150 or more health. The trap is a green item. Most of the time traps are not used for what they were originally intended to be. If they aren't being used within the first 30 seconds from dropping to place at your front door while you're looting a house or tilted towers, they are being used in midgame-endgame fights as a free kill for when you get tangled with another player. When they fixed the time to arm, they increased the damage as well which isnt necessarily something people were asking for but it wasnt really unwelcomed either.

My thoughts and opinions. I'm sure there is an even better way to change it up a little. I know hardly anyone is complaining about the current traps, but if yall remember, hardly anyone was complaining about the other ones either. Just the time to arm, which I'm certainly glad they fixed. Now I think it just needs a tiddle bit of balancing. ",FortNiteBR

Shotguns still can drop as low as 5-13 damage EVEN WITH 4-5 bullets hitting. They added the bullet hit indicators as a shit way of saying the reason shotguns do that low damage is because of our aim, but there are literally thousands of clips of people completely doming point blank with the shotgun, hitting all pellets, and still hitting low 10’s. 

ATK vehicles and shopping carts still glitch out or have random fall damage multipliers, AND they still have potential to glitch into the terrain allowing people to basically see and kill everyone over them. There have been 3 patches Epic have implemented that “fixed” this issue, yet it still occurs almost every 4-5 patches.

Building is a fuck all situation on its own. “Hurr hurr we’re the shits at Epic Games and your builds will glow yellow if people can shoot or walk through them.” WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY ALLOWING US TO BUILD IF THEY’RE NOT GOING TO FUNCTION ANYWAY??? Either make it so builds will actually do what they’re supposed to, or make it so people can’t build them at all when they can’t. Even when the builds don’t glow yellow, half the time people still phase through or can shoot through anyways. Before anyone tries to defend Epic saying the building mechanic is highly complex and bugs like that are naturally occurring, there are literal guides made by individuals that have replicated the same building mechanic on the same engine that performs 100x better than what Epic currently has.

Don’t get me fucking started on the shade cubes. How the fuck are they going to take 2+ days to patch something on release. It’s almost as if they’re too busy wiping each other’s asses on the night of release to test any of this new shit. OH RIGHT, THEY DON’T TEST ANYTHING AT ALL. As if it wasn’t bad enough that jump rocks were shit on release too, guess they didn’t learn shit from their past experiences.

So. Anyone know what the fuck is going on with this game company, or are we utterly fucked?",FortNiteBR

Since the money was refunded, the automated system in Fortnite removed not only the 10,300 V-Bucks it should have, but also extra V-Bucks I had before the purchases, my battlepass, and a skin; this left me at 0 V-Bucks total and a loss of a legendary Valkyrie skin.  

I contacted my bank and told them that it was not a scam and they should expect me to be buying V-Bucks again. But heres the problem: If I buy the two V-Bucks packages again, I will end up with less than I had before the removal and I will not have my skin it took away.

I believe that this is an EXTREME billing issue and it needs to be resolved ASAP!

I sent Epic Games support an email (which can be found below) telling them that the bank accidentally refunded my purchases and that the automated bot took away more things from my Fortnite account than it really should have. I WAS INSTANTLY replied to with an AUTOMATED EMAIL telling me about how I can ""return up to 3 cosmetic items and get a V-Buck refund"", and the email also told me that they CLOSED MY TICKET. THIS EMAIL COMPLETELY AVOIDS THE QUESTION I ASKED!!!

It would be appreciated if somebody can help me.
This is an extreme billing issue and it needs to be resolved immediately, but it is impossible to contact Epic Games because their phone number and their email system does not work at all.

This is the email I sent them, as previously stated above:

""Hello,

Recently I got a message after a Playground match telling me that my V-Bucks and my Valkyrie skin were removed from my account. I checked my email and I had two emails from Epic Games telling me that two purchases (A $59.99 and a $24.99) were refunded back to my credit card.

This is where the first issue begins. I never asked my bank for a refund or asked them to take any action. I consulted with them and they informed me that because of previous events of somebody scamming my credit card to buy V-Bucks, they automatically refunded the purchases, thinking it was the scammer again. I told my bank that it was not a scammer this time, and I will be purchasing more V-Bucks in the future so that there will be no more automatic refunds.

I understand that the V-Bucks had to be removed from my account because the money was refunded, but a terrible mistake happened. It took away the V-Bucks I had previously on my account before the purchases, and it also took away my Valkyrie skin. The V-Bucks that it took away from my account totaled up to more than the $59.99 and the $24.99 purchases could have bought me. 

I am planning on buying the $59.99 and $24.99 V-Buck packages again, but I will end up with less V-Bucks than I had before. I also will not have the Valkyrie skin. I believe that your systems took away more V-Bucks than it should have. When I buy the two V-Bucks packages again, I would like to have my Valkyrie skin returned to my account and 2,000 V-Bucks removed from it. I would also like to have the extra V-Bucks that the system took away returned to my account, if that is at all possible.

Thank you for your time, and I hope that the support team can help me figure out and resolve this major inconvenience.

Have a great day and sincerely,
Michael

He will go around the map picking up the runes accept for the one in the center of the map. Once he has picked them all up (ending in the one near lazy links) he will move to the center rune. Once he picks it up Dwayne will activate plunging the fortnite map into darkness (making locations like the corrupted zones). At the end of the season most areas will be corrupted but some will still be free. Forts made by survivors will be erected in the safe zones and the season will end. In the trailer for season seven it will show the survivors fighting of hordes of dark creatures (the werewolves, vampires, enforcers, and other dark skins that may be released later in the season) and it will show that one of the safe zones falls OR the same things happen but the survivors push the darkness back expanding the safe zones.

*Fire rate is measured by per second*

*Reload speed is measured in seconds*

SMG

Clip: 30

Fire rate: 12

**COMMON / WHITE**

**UNCOMMON / GREEN**

If you only hit body shots with the SMG it will take 

C: 1 second

U: 1 second 

R: .91 seconds 

to kill a 100/100 and with a P90

E: 1 second

L: 1 second

compared to Pumps, Tacs and Heavies

C:         n/a       / 2  seconds /      n/a

U:  4 seconds /  2 seconds /       n/a

R:  4 seconds /  2 seconds /       n/a

E:         n/a      /        n/a       /  3 seconds

L:         n/a      /        n/a       /  3 seconds

Whilst headshot damge would work in favour for shotguns it is unreliable on shotguns and is more difficult to hit when an smg can hit multiple headshots and body shots more easily and quicker whilst it can still shred walls relatively quick

but if the SMG had a clip of 10 and P90 had a clip of 10 to the and a clip of 9 also they would have to factor in reload times and it would look like this

SMG

3.4 seconds 

3.3 seconds

3.2 seconds

P90

4.1 seconds

4 seconds

Making them similar to shotguns on paper but people will miss a lot of shots so upping to clips to 

SMG

20

P90

18

 will allow leeway for failure but not so much were anyone can pick it up and kill. This would also remove its ability to destroy builds 

If Epic are concerend about casuals losing intrest they should make the mini gun more easier to get as it is meant to be a spray and pray gun but add a over heat feature so if you can out build it, which is difficult in the first place, you can get a chance to counter but I didnt really think this feature through  

In regards to pump smg 

a green pump and white smg would do

Before Nerf

80 + 0 - 510

After Nerf

80 + 0 - 255 

meaning you are still capable of killing some one without switching but gives a lot less room for failure and will have to fall back to your pump if you dont finish them meaning you cant just spray at them until they die so it rewards good aim more therefore there is a bigger skill gap.

P.S all of the seconds to kill mesurements were based off of 100/100 players if it wasnt clear",FortNiteBR

I am a Skull Trooper fan and people pay respect for that skin owners. I receive a bunch of invitations just because I killed somebody. I can feel the stress they undergo just because they're versing a Skull Trooper.

Epic should keep this as is and release a female version of Skull Trooper instead of releasing the actual skin itself.

Since we can still complete Ragnarok from s5 and will have the ability to complete Calamity and Dire next season, shouldn't it make sense to somewhat reinstitute the challenges from s4? I never had enough time to grind out Omega in S4 but I do now! Is this a possiblity or am I out of luck?",FortNiteBR

I don’t see why it isn’t the strongest , it just doesn’t make sense. 
Some people say because of rarity but rarity is just how rare something is not how effective (unless the same type of gun , for example a blue burst AR should be stronger then a green burst AR)
What should determine the strength of a gun should be it’s mechanics and when comparing the mechanics of the different shotguns it should obviously be Pump with the highest overall damage.
 
The pump is in such a bad position right now because you need a supporting gun to use it (such as an SMG) but this isn’t how shotguns should work, they should all be reliable and usable without the help of another gun.

What I think should happen is the pump should be buffed to be strongest , while the heavy shotguns drop off damage should also be decreased by a bit, it was first released as a “longer ranged shotgun” but it’s range is just slightly longer then the pumps, it only seems longer because it has such a high headshot multiplier. 

With these changes every shotgun would have its own  purpose

Pump Shotgun- Slowest Shotgun with the highest damage reward

Heavy Shotgun- Medium Fire Rate with Great Damage and long range

Tacticle Shotgun- High Fire Rate with decent damage, but the lowest out of the three.

The reason for this is finishing, thirsting, killing a downed player, whatever you would like to call it. I would be fine with this if there was a reason, but people just do it in the middle of fights which is really stupid. I’m an average skill player and I haven’t had s win in AGES with a full squad, because someone always gets downed and finished. If you get downed you can bet that you will not survive until the end of the fight.

I don’t really see why people need to finish, unless the downed players teammate(s) aren’t with them so the other players need his loot. 

I do not understand why people finish in the middle of fights, is it to boost your kd, to show off to your friends that you got an undeserved kill? I genuinely don’t know so if you are someone who always finishes, please tell me why in the comments

Anyway I have a couple of ways that epic could fix this problem

1.Immunity: for a certain amount of time (15-30 seconds could work) the player is invincible, not able to be killed by anything (except storm and fall damage)
2.Proximity: This one’s a little more far fetched but I think it still should be here. If the player’s teammates are within a certain distance (50 metres probably) the player has the same invincibility but if they are further than the set distance they are able to be killed

These two could also be combined to just have 15-30 seconds unless their teammate is further than 50 metres.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope it gets taken into consideration. I know I am not the only one who HATES getting thirsted when my teammates are trying to have a fair fight.",FortNiteBR

I still don't have that challange done either but I'm not hunting for llamas, I'm sure epic will add some crazy new limited time mode that will increase the chances of finding a llama. 

If you haven't completed it yet, I wouldn't worry about it until around week 8 because if you haven't found one by then you might be that one guy who never finds a llama.

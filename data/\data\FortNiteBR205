Thanks Epic! I went to bed last night anxious and excited about waking up to season 6. I woke up at 0500 WIDE AWAKE and started the update. Once it was done I woke my son up and went through all the updates. While we looked at every tier level it felt a little like opening presents on Christmas Day.

Look, I‚Äôm 34 years old. Never been a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù, but my 9 year old kid and I started playing at the end of season 3 and it‚Äôs been great to have fortnite as something else we have in common.

The game hadn't included this yet, being very family-friendly due to many many kids playing it, but why did they think it's a good idea to add it to the most used skin in the upcoming season? 

I'm a grown person, not a 12 year old kid, who's excited to see such things, I just want to point out this interesting change they included. 

If I'd have kids, I don't know how I would feel about this.

Blackout is coming out very soon and S6 was the last chance for Epic to convince me to play their game over any other BR and they did. 

I just went through all of the patch notes and they fixed things I thought it would take more time. They added custom key bindings, performance optimization across all platforms etc. 

The update itself is great but what's greater is EPIC for delivering a huge \[no pun intended\] update and giving us what they promised.

Wailing Woods has three new cabins and the center hedge maze has changed into a stronghold of sort.  The cabins have lots of loot and Blair Witch victim bears (you'll see).  Also mystery Dusty Divot-esque walk-in tubes which go nowhere.  The center hedge stronghold now has wire fencing and the ""maze"" is no longer.  Just concentric squares and the middle tower is empty.

2.  The corruption cubes turn you into a floaty, nearly invisible smokey ghost.  When you're still you have a faint wisp of smoke where you stand/kneel (can you kneel?).  You can phase through object by clicking on fire.  It ends after 20 seconds maybe?  Or you can click right click on PC to end it.  Your hands go out and it's over.  When driving, you exit the ATK when the ghost time ends, you don't continue driving.  (yes you can drive as a smoke ghost)  You cannot pick up items except ammo and materials.

3.  The floating island has lots of chests around the edge.  When you walk off the edge, you float in the skydive pose and can launch your glider.  If you walk up toward the Kevin Island Vortex from the bottom, you float toward the top.  You can bounce off Kevin like before and also, he'll shoot lightning if you attack him.  The mud around the bottom of the lake looks like pudding.  The water effects are cool though.

4.  The Haunted Castle is fall-damage-apalooza.  Haven't explored it much.  I'd go to Junk and snipe 'em if you can.

5.  Fatal Fields has corn fields now that you can chop down and also walk through.  When in the cornfield, you can be heard rustling if you move, but otherwise you're invisible to anyone looking in from the side.  Not sure about above.  You can just sneak in and kneel and no one should know you're there.  You sorta ""phase"" through the corn and can see a few feet around you.  Ghosts hang from the windmill now.

6.  The villain lair is now dilapidated with broken walls and wood boards.  You can easily get into the basement from outside now.

7.  I've seen a few rifts around, but no Easter Island heads anymore.  Didn't see rifts where I thought I'd see them a few times, but did see a few.  Maybe the rifts near the heads are gone?  Unsure.  Rift-to-go is still around.

8.  I'm not doing battle pass this season.

9.  I may add more as I play more.

Welcome to season 6! 

Our [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9javlr/season_6_megathread_with_links_to_other/) is full of pre-patch discussion, and this will clear out the clutter so users that would like to discuss about changes, can do so after they have played the game.

We hope this is something you enjoy, and let us know what you think about this, by dropping feedback in the comments. The moderators will look over the comments and be proactive in the way we adapt the subreddit.

Thanks!

By this, I mean it should not shoot as fast as it used to, and be slower than a tac, but still be eligible as a weapon choice. Right now, the pump is a bit weak with its 1.5 headshot damage multiplier. If it were to stay this way, the double pump could allow recovery time, instead of hitting a person for 70 with a headshot, then have to spam an SMG trying to pick off whatever health they have left. They could switch over to another pump and finish them off. If someone was to argue it takes no skill to use, the TAC doesn‚Äôt either with its extremely fast recovery time. I‚Äôm not saying the double pump needs the exact recovery time as the tac, but just a little bit of breathing space to get the second shot off in time before getting hit with another tac shot.Spamming somebody with an SMG or a P90 while they are trying to build is not ‚Äúskillful‚Äù either, as all you have to do is hold down the left mouse button and aim. If you were to also argue that the double pump grants an unfair advantage, consider the fact that if the equipping time of was a little bit more delayed, had the timer removed, and kept at 1.5 or even nerfed down a bit, it‚Äôs really not. If the timer was also removed in general, it would combine both the spray meta and the shotgun meta. If you were good at spraying, stick to it, but if you were better at double pump, or even pump tac, switch back to that. It all really comes down to balancing out the shotguns if double pump or pump tac was added back. I am obviously a shotgun enthusiast by this fully -fledged paragraph I wrote about it, but I‚Äôd like to know what you dudes think about this spray meta and whether the shotgun meta should be resurrected.",FortNiteBR

Secondly, so far there have been three teaser images, a llama, a cowboy and wolf, all of which connect to Lil Wayne. One of Weezy's lyrics is ""Wear cowboy clothes call that ranch dressing."" Lil Wayne also has a song titled ""Big Bad Wolf"" this is most likely a connection to the teaser that released today.

* Tier 23: Inflatable Llama Spitfire
* Tier 47:  Female Archer or Dryad
* Tier 71: Chicken Trooper
* Tier 87: Heavily suited for radioactive protection skin (Similar to Toxic Trooper)
* Tier 100: The Dogman

Here's my explanation for each skin tier if you have some spare time to read: the Kevin Cowgirl is there just because she screams out the potential cube theme for the season; just as Huntress for the Viking theme and Battlehawk for military/superheroes. But the reason I think the Llama is upgradable is because with the mild futuristic theme going on (Enforcers, the DeLorean, futuristic-looking street racers, Archetype, Kevin himself) towards the end of the season, he could be a FUTURE LLAMA. With cybernetic upgrades. Maybe he could transcend past needing to play the music to actually having built in boomboxes in his body. As for the dogman, he can just upgrade to become a stronger and more powerful wolf (probably stage 3 or 4 in the teaser) ~~and my stupidass also thought that wolves hunted llamas so it would make sense if natural enemies were tiers 1 and 100~~. Inflatable boi just seems like he belongs there idk; and the Archer/Dryad at 47 makes sense to me because Wailing Woods was partially destroyed by Kevin, so she could be there to protect the forest/help replant it. Maybe when she discovers the bunker, Vindertech will come investigate it? As for Chicken Trooper, this was a highly treasured and requested community design, and Epic *will* do fan service; remember back in season 4 when everyone was kind of sad Orange Shirt Kid didn't win the boogie down? \[From what I could tell\] He was top trending only one week before the launch of season 4, yet Epic still added his emote to the BP. Plus if chicken trooper is a military trained chicken, it fits right in with the military-themed higher tier BP skins we've been having from S3+. I actually don't know why Hazmat Man would be there, maybe someone from VT who wanted to investigate the low-gravity fields Kevin made.",FortNiteBR

Scenario: You and another guy land top of mountain by salty (you know, the one where the secret battle pass star was) and you go by the chest. The guy gets the chest and the gun and starts to shoot at you. You slide off of the mountain and run away in another direction, what does the guy do? Naturally, he should probably loot up, get resources, get ammo, get more than 1 gun, etc. Instead he JUMPS OFF THE DAMN MOUNTAIN and stalks you down using the common pistol he received from the chest. 


Yes, I understand if you and somebody else land in the same house/POI,  you want to eliminate the threat. In this scenario however, I pose 0 threat and have very little health and am running away. What is so important about killing me that you neglect the other 80% of the area that you‚Äôve inhabited with nobody else to bother you? 

Instead of playing it smart, you‚Äôre now off the mountain with no resources to get back up and almost no ammo/guns to defend yourself. Funny enough in this situation, the dude went to the stone head by shifty and got obliterated by s dude with an smg. Karma works in mysterious ways.

It's the perfect length because I don't have to use my finger to click my binds, since my nails can easily reach them. Basically, this means I don't have to fully press down with my finger.



Another thing is how I click with my mouse. I use a claw style grip, but if I just recently cut my nails, I would have to use my fingers which really throws me off.




Anyone else like this? This is a recurring problem because I have to cut my nails about every two weeks meaning I am going to suck every two weeks for about a week.

But not a player was spotted, from near or afar,

As I stood patienly with my new golden scar;

When up from a mountain, there arose such a clatter,

I was shot in the head, but this was no matter;

I built, and I built, and I kept my morale,

Until I had won that battle royale;

So in May, I bought a Nintendo switch (before fortnite was on the platform) and after fortnite was released for switch for a few months, there was a console exclusive skin released with the Helix Pack for switch. This pack I dont care too much about because of how bad it looks and the fact that I did buy the system before fortnite was even released on it. 

The real problem starts with the brand new announced X Box exclusive Eon set. I literally ordered an X box one last week and now I can't get the exclusive skin and v bucks for it (kinda disappointed) but oh well.  

My solution is that when the promotion for buying a certain console ends, we get the ability to get the skin for owning the console but without buying a new one. I can also understand why epic wouldn't do this and its a ""too bad for you"" situation. Thoughts? ",FortNiteBR

TLDR: Looking for some really awesome/kind hearted people to help me come over a really silly social anxiety of mine


     I've been struggling with social anxiety all my life. Whether it be in person or even just phone calls. Over the past few months Fortnite has definitely been a cornerstone game. One that helps me get through some of the more lonely times when I feel im missing out on things I cell mighta/shoulda been able to go to if it wasnt for the anxiety.


     I recently decided that a good way to maybe try &amp; ""break the ice"" so to speak would be to buy a mic &amp; start talking to people (I almsot always play solo in any mode since few of my few friends play amy video games) in squad/duo modes. The thing I could even bring myself to turn my mic on and when I did I rarely/barely talked.


     I guess what im trying to say is im looking for some really awesome/patient/kind hearted people to help me come over a really silly social anxiety of mine. Fair warning im still not the greatest at the game. Thats where the ""patience"" comes in üòÖ",FortNiteBR

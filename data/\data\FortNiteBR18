It seriously saved my life.,"It’s cringe i know, but Fortnite actually saves my life. I downloaded when it first came out to play with my cousin bc he was asking me to. He was my only friend. I was depressed, alone, and had nothing. My previous friends were pretending to be my friends and would bully me and talk shit behind my back. Things got worse for a while, but In study hall there were a few kids I’ve known for years and we all sat at the same table and we talked about one thing: Fortnite. I started showing them my clips (I don’t want to sound cocky but I am just naturally good at games) and they thought I was good. But things were getting worse. I got bullied more, and I was severely depressed, heavily overweight. Kicked out of a lunch table because people didn’t want to associate with meIn early march, I decided I was going to kill myself that week. I got a text message the day I decided that I was going to kill myself from a boy in the study hall asking to play fortnite. This is the first time we played, and we played Duos. We won our 3rd game and I had 10 kills and he had 3. I remember every detail. I thought it was just a day he wanted to play. The next day, he texted saying get on again and he brought his best friend ever in the party. We started to play daily, and they made plans to hang out and I offered my house. They actually wanted to be friends with me, and we became friends because of fortnite. They are my best friends now, and we have since then added 5 other guys into our friend group. I’m no longer depressed, I’m getting into shape, and I have a confidence and friendly with everyone in school. It’s corny i know, but Fortnite really saved my life.",FortNiteBR

At the time it was refreshing to play since the game was far less buggy then and ran far better then PUBG (RIP). But in the last few season every up date epic keeps messing with the meta. Either adding something stupid hours before a tournament like the infinity blade or the boom box thing. Or making the game into a camping fest by adding the plain or the ball thing. Now I think epic is burning out or running out of ideas so they take out stuff players want to keep in like the pump shot gun or siphoning. With the up dates being so often unless your a streamer and playing the game is your job or a 12 year old with endless amount of time to put into the game it's impossible to keep up with the changes its makes it feel like I'm falling behind, it's frustrating because I want to see the epic games store grow but they're too focused on footnote to improve the store. I they slow down withe updates and have a standard meta for the game for at lest two seasons. Change the updates to bi-weekly I would enjoy the game again because I wouldn't fell like I'm lagging behind everyone since I have a life.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Fortnite, uses two different anti cheats. Battle-Eye, and Easy Anti-Cheat. They swap you between them, im not sure at what 'reason' or 'when'.

&amp;#x200B;

When you are on Battle-Eye, you will have TONS of FPS spikes, lower overall FPS,mini-stutters and input lag. 90% of the time, when someone says 'OMG THIS PATCH DESTROYED PERFORMANCE, EPIC USELESS', the reality is, all that happened, is that person got swapped onto Battle-Eye that patch.

&amp;#x200B;

Its the reason so many people have varying performance. If you dont have a god tier PC, Battle-Eye killing your performance is even more noticeable.

&amp;#x200B;

EPIC has NEVER addressed this, because no one ever brings this up, and when they do, it never gets upvoted, because people are more intrested in upvoting the latest 'fuck baller' posts, instead of shit that really matters.",FortNiteBR

2.ability to destroy anything in 1 shot except the supply drop

all 2 of these ability with virtually no downside (reload speed doesn't matter since you can just duck right back behind your 1x1 and be safe..+..you have ability to 1 shot a player and even worse in the time when healing item is rare while other br""s healing item is everywhere)

(extra here: fortnite by far has the lowest healing item spawn rate i ever seen in br shooter..even in pubg the band aids are ultra common(absolutely everywhere)..same with the level 1 vest or basic armor..even more so in {redacted because the bot will *unfortunately* smite this post..just because the game is epic""s current competition even tho it pretty dead on twitch} where med kit shiled cell are absolutely everywhere(and these can heal you with no limit or healing cap)

This is obviously severely impacting my performance in the late stages of the game and its frustrating for me as I did spend a significant amount of money on my PC and I feel that people with worse computers are getting higher frames than me.

I saw on twitter that there was a guy that was going through Pro players pc'S with them and boosting their frames from like 80-150 fps in some cases, one of these pros I am friends with and I have reason to believe that its not just a hoax but that some people can of course change aspects of a pc's settings to increase fortnite FPS.

Does anyone know of any people or services that would just go through for an hour or two with you and prioritise your computer to get the most fps possible in fortnite?

First of all, if you use a combat shotgun you dont need an smg or any other weapon, you could just us an AR and a Combat shotgun and you will be fine for the rest of the game.

Secondly, It's f\*\*\*ing impossible to find. I'm always unlucky with loot and I barely ever find a combat shotgun, if im lucky ill find a tac.

And also its not made for close range combat, its a shotgun for short-mid range combat.

Apparently the ikonik skin is available only in the US , which would have been totally fine if epic actually told us that , nowhere does it say that the promotion is available only in the US

I contacted epic by email , they told me that there was no issue on their end and that I'd have to contact samsung 

when I contacted samsung I got re-directed to another team that's supposed to handle their estore , who then re-directed me to another team , i spent a good 20 mins chatting with this guy who then told me that the skin was only available in the US , he then told me to go into the samsung members app on my phone , settings--&gt;send error logs   
 \--&gt;lock up or restarting reports--&gt; and send the screen shots through that

&amp;#x200B;

thing is , I cant send anything through that option , its just a toggle that gives the device permission to send error reports when the phone shuts off or restarts , the guy who was chatting with me didn't even know what that option did....wtf

&amp;#x200B;

so basically I'm stuck with no option to get skin even though It's not informed anywhere that the skin was exclusive to the US , absolutely shitty advertising by epic and I doubt I will ever buy more skins from their item shop, I just hope this hits the front page or something so that others who are about to buy the phone can be aware of this

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't buy the phone ONLY for the skin , it's a great phone , but the ikonik skin did convince me to spend an extra 200$ get this over the one plus 7 pro",FortNiteBR

I was hoping to just ride out the ps4 till ps5 next year, but since I'm getting more and more into a couple games I decided to look into the pro.

Now when playing Fortnite my FPS constantly dips (high 40s low 50s ) specially in end circles where all the guys are sweating or in team rumble

I even turned save replay off so i don't think there's much more i can do

- Vehicles
- Rifts/Rifts To Go
- Ziplines 
- Glider Redeploy 
- Slipstreams 
- Bounce Pads
- Geysers/Air Vents

That's a lot of ways to get around. And the problem that arises from it is you can't predict other players movements. Anyone can show up from anywhere at anytime and challenge you. 

That's a big problem. For one it makes the storm almost inconsequential until the late game circles. Players die way less from the storm than they did in ""old Fortnite"" and as a result there's more potential threats and obstacles in your way towards winning. 

Secondly glider redeploy in general makes building up to high ground kind of pointless. Someone can just glide up to the top of your build and shotgun you. Where before opponents would have to climb their way up the ""tower"" to challenge you. Just like with the grappler it's just an easy way to get on top of builds with minimal effort. 

So considering all of that what should Epic do? I suggest removing all the mobility options. Which they won't do because the employees at Epic dint understand their own game. 

Consider if you will what the gameplay would be like without all the mobility options listed above. It would be a lot better. The storm would be just as much of a threat as other players (like it used to be) and other players movements can be predicted and maneuvered around. Build battles would be more vital and less risky and ultimate  high ground would be something desired and worth struggling to gain. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again but ""walking simulator 2018"" was the unsung hero of Fortnites gameplay and the secret ingredient to it's success.",FortNiteBR

What\`s making Fortnite aggressive is all the movement on the map right now. Baller, Rifts, Rif-To-Go, slipstream, airbase, zipline, jumpads.... You can literally get from Lucky Landing to Pleasant Parks in under 3 minutes. The biggest problem of Fortnite, are and have always been Thirdparties... With all the movement on the island, you can literally land anywhere you want, farm up, get 100 health and 100 shild, and just rush into any POI you want....

&amp;#x200B;

The thing here is that the playerbase is divided into 2 groups. You have the ""killer"" group, that doesn\`t care about placement, he hunts down enemies to get as high killcount as he can, and while doing this, he hopes to win.

&amp;#x200B;

And you have the ""placement"" group,. This group goes for wins and placement, some by landing alone on the outskirts of the map, some by landing in POI, but generally, this group is more passive then the other group. For the placement group, the game is erfect right now, but for the killergroup, this game is a nightmare. I\`M gonna take myself as an example. Just landed Salty Springs, landed a few others, we fought and i ended up winnin Salty with 5 kills, i had 75 health, no shield, around 150 mats. As soon as i\`m finished looting, a player swoops in, we end up fighting, but with no health an no mats, i obviously lost. He hadd 100/100 health, around 1200 mats and all blue loot. I feel like this isn\`t fair.

&amp;#x200B;

And don\`t take me wrong, i don\`t take me wrong, i don\`t think that any of theese groups are better players, smarter or anything, i\`m just stating the fact that people get joy from different things from the game. But right now, i feel like myself and many others don\`t get the same joy as we are in the killergroup, and unless you get out of a POI playing like a god, taking no damage, have the time to farm up and find shild, you stand absolutely no chance. I literally don\`t think the game is as much fun as it used to be....

&amp;#x200B;

Since season 7, this place has become my favourite POI. We drop almost exclusively in polar. The castle really rewards knowing the ins and outs.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there's another structure in the map with as much flexibility in how you approach it with the number of entrances and different layers as the castle. It lets you make smart attacks from different angles, rewarding escapes when you're low or just have a late drop etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It also has a decent amount of real estate to get some distance between enemies and you instead of contesting a specific area. Not to mention the chest spawns/weapons and the mats you can get. You can leave with a ton of brick/wood if you win the initial engagements.

&amp;#x200B;

Issues people might have with polar is rotating in/out. And they're right, especially rotating in late zone. However, rotating out has never really been a huge issue for us unless we lose track of the storm timer (which can happen in most POIs). There's a good chance of leaving the place with redeploy with all the spawns there, there's a hoverboard in the room near the top, theres a healthy amount of ziplines in close proximity to it that lead to vehicles (baller/hoverboard) and now, you can even build to the air platform and fly out (mat intensive but yeah).

That's right, YOU HAVEN'T! It is all fort to fort combat, and that is what the devs intended fortnite to be. Ground game encourages fort to fort combat more. And before you say ""yOu OnLy GeT 100 mAtS kId!!!"" think about where mats are placed. They are commonly placed in bulk. allowing you and your team to go back and forth from gathering materials to build a killer base like in the trailers.

Just to name a few- his undershirt, skin tone, placement and size of scar, and (the most obvious difference) his hair.
To put it bluntly- Season 3 players with the Reaper aren’t entitled to a new skin that is completely different with the only similarity being the fact they have suits and dress shoes on.

   recent feedback from Fortnite players has gave me a really good idea. I'm a developer and designer and would like to ask for permission for something. However, before I get into the main point a suggestion is to release all older patches of Fortnite to be available to Fortnite players. If not, I would like to ask for permission to re-make the older version of Fortnite, so basically like season 3 Fortnite with the same older guns, layout, etc. using the paks available in the game files This will take a while as I am not really familiar with Unreal Engine but I could give it a try. Now, IF I succeed, I would want to release out for the public, but now here's the catch.There will be NO itemshop or marketplace to buy vbucks. This could prevent me from making any money off a game that Epic Games worked hard to make. I solely want to make this older version for the nostalgia and enjoyment of others. I am still working on details because this just popped in my head but I would really like to know your opinion on this.",FortNiteBR

But aren't y'all taking it a bit far?

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a couple of posts on here that weren't even related to the player wearing the skin, and the comments just harassed the OP because of the skin. I've even seen one try to defend themselves, saying they simply liked the skin and wasn't really a sweat, only to be met with more criticism. This whole meme has genuinely made some of y'all think soccer skins are the scum of the earth, but you have to remember that there's people who:  


1. Aren't sweaty at all, they just like the skin.
2. Sometimes gets mad at the game, but they're genuinely good people in real life.
3. Probably are sweaty and they just like the skin because of how it looks, not because 'it's a sweaty skin'.

&amp;#x200B;

The meme was funny for a short while, but now it's just devolved into people ridiculing and as said before, harassing other people simply for wearing a cosmetic. That's really immature, and you could seriously make people feel bad about themselves for using a skin that they may simply like because of how it looks.

Vault it or nerf it.,"This is hands down the most broken weapon we have ever seen. It deals high damage from high ranges, shoots super fast and has 10 shells in a clip. 

It’s literally double pump without the ridiculous headshot damage, but that doesn’t matter because it doesn’t require the small amount of skill that double pump required and it also only takes up one slot.

It outclasses every close range weapon in the game, even the drum gun. It’s also got lower spawn rates now (because Epic saw how powerful it was) but this makes it even more RNG.

Now, my solutions for a nerf.

Option 1: Slower fire rate - Change it to the rate of the tac, but this would make it too similar to the tac potentially.

Option 2: Lower damage - I would still pick this gun up every single time if it did 50 to the body and 100 to the head. I like this change.

Option 3: Lower range - Keep it exactly the same in all aspects but give it the range of a normal shotgun, maybe this takes away its unique feeling and makes it pointless

Option 4: Vault it - Unvault the pump in its’ place but with less than 100 damage to the body on all rarities while also reintroducing the 2.5x headshot multiplier so the it can still one shot to the head.",FortNiteBR

I just want to get my opinion out there.
Give us the option to disable Vsync on console PLEASE ! The devs are comstantly trying to make thimgs balanced right ? You guys want to make everything fair right ? Then think about all the console players at a disadvantage against PC players that play with a controller... Because yes, Fortnite Matchmaking is input-based so if you play on console you do encounter pc players playing with a controller. Vsync just puts an big input lag and its annyoing, ask any pc player that plays controller if he'll go back to console they'll say no, not only because of the FPS but also because of input lag or if u are on console connect youre mouse and keyboard and try to play and you'll see how delayed it is because its more noticeable with a mouse than with a joystick.

TL:DR ) We need a Vsync toggle in the settings on console, too much input lag.",FortNiteBR

Yes I get they are big and have lots of influence but they could have talked about it to their chat and informed them on stream, which most streamers did. Why do they feel the need to post a video about it? This is drama between Faze Clan and Turner, nobody wanted this out in the public so why are big streamers making a huge kerfuffle out of something that should've been extremely secret.

1. Banks was blindsided by the lawsuit not by tfue's unhappiness with the contract and wanting out of it.

2. They tried to renegotiate that's why they flew to his house, agreeing to NOT collect anything from the previous contract. 

3. It's true the contract is bad, faze DID say they had a bad management and legal team before and since then that has changed with other players' contracts. NOTE: No other player has come out and complained.   

4. Tfue clearly does not want to be in faze at all, that's why he wasn't even trying to renegotiate. 

5. Why? To get out of his contract completely so he can start his own org (whether his brother hacked is up in the air, but it does make sense right? purely in the self-interest standpoint.

6. Is it a bad contract, do people get bad contracts? Yes all the time and they deserve to be represented properly. Was it about being represented properly? Honestly doesn't sound like it. 

7. Did Faze do Tfue wrong? Besides the contract which they stated they would amend completely. Absolutely fucking not. They would have given him anything as long as he represented them, but HE DOESNT WANT TO. He COULD have gotten a very good lawyer to renegotiate ALL the terms to make it favorable towards him but he doesn't try. WHY? HE WANTS OUT!

5- Playing passive is extremely rewarding

6- Some players only enjoy game because  they like annoying ""soccer skins""

7- Because team rumble is the only large team mode that is offered

8- Because ""soccer skins"" think they are good at game since they spray or turtle everytime they are outskilled in build fights.

9- Because fortnite has a community who will question my age in the comments of this post, to explain why I am whining.

10-  Game at the current state only centered around punishing ""building"" which was initially main appeal of this game.

11-Infantry rifle and other good AR'S are too rare.

He was normally playing on my account on ps4 but then, he started to adding friends, i then, decided to unlink my epic account from my psn account. 
So, basically, i would have my skins and battle pass on my xbox, and my PS4 would have a brand new account associated with epic right?
Well... Here is where everything goes WRONG: my ps4 still had access to my epic account, and OODLY it was recognizing as a Xbox. And in epic site, it was showing that my epic account was ONLY linked with my xbox, but i could not link any other ps4 to it (i should be able to, right?). 
I already tried creating a new epic account and trying to link to my ps4, but it doesn't allow...
So now im stuck with a ps4 that think it is a xbox, and when i deactivate cross play, it only matchmakes with xbox players... And there is no way to unlink bcuz it does not show as linked...
Ahhhh, can anyone help?

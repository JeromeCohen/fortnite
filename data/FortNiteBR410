------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did the math and from leveling from 50 to 100 I will get 115 / 530 Stars needed.

If I do every daily Challenge for next 34 days I will get 340 Stars.

340+115 = 455/530 so I will still be short 75 stars. 7 and a half Tiers from 70 so I will need to buy 8 tiers at the end to reach level 70. ",FortNiteBR

a fucking childrens phone game. thats what this game is, its a childrens phone game. shitty cartoony graphics that belong on a nintendo 64 game, dumb f@gg1ty (autistic filter on this sub) fairytale map design with gay candyland named shit like fuckin gumdrop forest and candy cane island, autistic minecraft phonegame ingame building that offers no advantage tactically, and pretty much exclusively 12-and-unders playing the game, screaming into their microphones like banshees. i could deal with a shit community if it didnt have 007 goldeneye graphics set in what appears to be a dr. seuss-themed world, but it turns out that every factor of this game screams developer incompetance and community failure.

this game seriously looks &amp; plays like something my nephew would be fucking around with on his ipad. he's 6. either grow the fuck up and play pubg, or stop pretending to be a 'competitive community' when your game has as much competitive potential as fucking candy crush.

I just got out of about 5-6 duo games. My partner and I got to final 4 three times. Each fucking time the other team had a rocket launcher and we just insta lose. Someone better than me (which isn't saying much) explain how rocket launchers are balance.

- Their reload really is absurdly short.
- Their stupidly accurate.
- And in a game that relies so much on building it's just so broken against building that it just comes down to if you get into a battle with someone with a rocket launcher, in my experience, that person wins. 

I've only played about 20-25 hours of the game, but as far as I can tell the end game is generally: Get to late game through early skirmishes in locations with loot, then follow the circle in until it's small enough that there is no more sneaking. Once you reach that point try to build a structure in which you can get a height advantage and see people coming.

If the other team has a rocket launcher, you just aren't allowed to have cover due to practically everything being destructible. I know I sound tilted as hell, but it's because I am. Losing to someone who all they have to do is just shoot rockets at you from cover as their teammate picks you off while you are forced to run is so absolutely infuriating.

edit: I've had time to cool off and read some responses. Apparently I'm alone in a lot of this. Not sure how. Guess I'll learn more as I keep playing? I'll check back in on this in another 10-15 hours of game time and see if my opinion changes. Doubt it though.",FortNiteBR

I watch my teammates as well as enemies who killed me play all the time and I've discovered a very simple pattern.

No one knows how to influence bloom.  

For example, if an enemy unknowingly runs past me, I will run to a good position, crouch down, stop moving, and tap trigger and I down people very quickly and easily this way.

On the flip side, if I unknowingly run past someone and start getting shot at,it's shocking to me to see just how often my attacker is standing up, running towards me, and holding the fire button.

I'll hear my friends cimplain about ""THE RNG!!!"" all the time when they're clearly not doing everything they can to control it.

I tell them all the time ""There's no reason to be standing in a base if you're taking pot shots at people.""  Yet, they never learn.  It's like something in their brain prevents them from learning.

Does anyone else notice this too?  The community really doesn't like to crouch, stand still, and tap trigger and I don't know why.

Oh and they always think they should be able to snipe with the regular AR.  Know each weapons effective range!!

Bloom isnt perfect but I honestly blame bloom on my death maybe once or twice a month.  And I play this game a lot.  Is anyone else with me?",FortNiteBR

This game is special because of the build mechanics. I played like 10 games only, and it is hard for me to grasp. I saw some ppl doing CRAZY shit with that feature.

My question - how do you practice with build and experimenting with key bindings for those things? Just wait in the bus till the end drop off and don't bother with game? Loot some wood and practice building for a 3-4 games until you get comfortable? Because I see people killing me by building crap over building, dropping on my head and building forts around them pretty fast. When I see those things I am like - WTF?! What do I do now.

Again, I played only 10 games so far - and never played any other Battle Royale modes ever. So cut me some slack and recall yourself at those stages.

In a couple games I died super fast (I try to stay away from big cities, its a slaughter obviously) or far into the game but still had no weapon. Bad luck or just following wrong paths... I got really frustrated. How do you learn map (and location of the good stuff) when you always rush to stay alive and people are on your ass with a shotguns. I assume some loot always spawns in specific spots and I need to learn that.

How long did it take for you folks to figure out all those sweet spots? Like I am holding my dick in one hand and a white pistol in another, maaaybe a green shotgun if I got lucky. Then I see a guy running past me with a sniper rifle, then pull out RPG, peew pew and then keeps on rolling.

Also, how do you talk in the game or add friends? In one of the games I got cornered by a person with a shotgun and I was hiding in a little box with a door. Eventually I got out of it and person realized I didn't have a gun :D He/she just left me and kept running. I would love to add that person to chat, ask why and maybe that player was a good sport after all.

I think localhost playground or a tutorial mode would be very useful to comfortably run around and practice Fortcraft",FortNiteBR

One of the best I’ve ever seen is from the game Evolve, where the hunters could click R3 to mark a location and place a small yellow dot on their teammates screens. This was perfect to allow teammates without mics to still communicate as they knew the monster was in the direction of the marker.

My fear is now players will be able to find loot on the outskirts of the map making the game much more spread out and even “clusterfucky” if you will. But on the same token locations like the City might forever be hotspots due to their high loot and kill potential, meaning that maybe the outskirts will remain abandoned. What are your predictions for this? My personal opinion is that the new map will be very random and almost confusing when it comes out because players will be dropping anywhere and everywhere. The city will be an absolute mess and high kill games will be common. As players learn the maps and the new hotspots I see the game changing back to how it was with the City, Retail, and Pleasant holding the top 3. ",FortNiteBR

I feel the map is too small for cars, bikes, buggies etc  but I feel something like a train could work out, like the title suggests, before you downvote me at this point hear me out.
 
A train that follows the same quirky names as the rest of Fortnite Battle Royale, the Torpedo Train. It would be a constantly moving train that would have no stopping point and would require players to jump on and off, going at the right speed to allow this but also dealing damage if a jump is miss timed. It would leave from a Station which would allow for a new Point of Interest to be added to the game, giving players more landing spots and loot to be uncovered. I feel a good time for the train to leave the Station and start it's trek of the map would be when the first Safe Zone is established. 

While there would be loot chests in the Station I also think it would be a nice idea to  have some high level loot within the Carriages of the train. Made up of 4 medium sized cabins and 2 or 3 freight crates being pulled behind would be the rough design I'd  go for, players wouldn't be  able control the train or anything just open the doors to the cabins and run around on it.

Now for the journey, I haven't fully played out a route for the train as this is only a rough idea but it would pass through every major Point of Intrest, allowing players to leave and get on wherever they happen to land or be positioned on the map at any given time, tracks would have to be added in with the Train.

As many players can be on the train at one time and would have to fight to take control off it, killing opposing players who try to get on it of.

I haven't made any Concept art of the idea like the user who came up with Haunted Hills did as this is only a rough idea and I'm not the most artistic. If anyone would like to add anything or  put any suggestions please feel free to do so.

So you have to spend $40 for one and $10 on the other to even have the option of earning the V-Bucks.

2.  Tips for adjusting to M&amp;K for someone who has basically 0 experience with M&amp;K?  Mainly getting accustomed to movement control with the Keyboard as opposed to joystick.

Background:
So I just switched from PS4 to PC.  Literally last week I felt like I finally ""got gud"" on PS4.  It took me 150 games to get my first solo win, then I got maybe 8 wins in the next 30 games.  I was making plays, building quickly, and just playing awesome games...

Then my components for my PC came in and... well I'm horrible again.

I have virtually NO experience with any game on M&amp;K.  I played Wolfenstein 3D when I was a kid, like... before the AOL days, that's it lol

My main questions are... Do you guys have any tips on how to learn / adjust to the new layout?  Should I just keep playing and give it time?  Should I start with a simpler game that doesn't have as much vertical movement, building, etc?

Also, I noticed that after like 4 or 5 games last night my left hand/wrist was hurting and it still feels kind of ""tired"" as I start typing this morning.  Stretching my pinky down to shift and holding it basically the whole game doesn't feel pleasant after 15 or 20 minutes.  I thought about changing my movement from ""WASD"" to ""ESDF"" so sprint can be ""A"" but that involves a lot of re-assigning.

I wish I could find videos of someone playing Fortnite (or something similar), but having their hands in the stream so I can see how they are moving, etc.  I also notice that when I get into a shootout... I ""forget"" about my left hand and just hold down whatever I had already been pressing... Got in a shotgun fight last night and literally just jogged straight forward at the person when I could have easily used cover.  I won the fight but I could have done it without almost dying and losing my shield.

Anyway, any tips you guys could give on how to get used to the new controls I'd appreciate it.  Maybe it's just... play for 50 hours until you get used to it... but sometimes there are other suggestions that I might not think of.  LIke ""go play this game for a while, it's simpler and will get you accustomed to WASD"".

But my main concern is probably the fatigue on my hand.  I don't want to end up with carpal tunnel, and I know I should be able to play longer than 30 minutes before my wrist starts getting sore.",FortNiteBR

duo: a golf cart
squad: a 4 person golf cart? (couldn’t think of anything, open to better ideas)

players will still be vulnerable to damage while using these “vehicles” as there is no cover provided by doors or windshields/windows.

as for speed, if jogging is 5mph, and sprinting is 10mph, then these vehicles should be able to go 15mph (using easy math to keep it simple). also it’d be hilarious to see a lawnmower traveling at 15mph. 

as for health, each vehicle starts off with 200HP that is non repairable. you *cannot* use metal to repair vehicles. once they’re gone. they’re gone.

to ensure that not everyone in the lobby is driving around in these things:

solo: 8 randomly placed lawnmowers 
duo: 4 randomly placed golf carts
squad: 2 randomly placed 4 man golf carts

my reasoning for this is that no matter the game mode it’s the same amount of max players allowed in a vehicle.

solo: 8 lawnmowers x 1 player = 8 players
duo: 4 golf carts x 2 players = 8 players
squad: 2 golf carts x 4 players = 8 players 

*IF* Fornite were to add vehicles i believe these vehicles make perfect sense as, imo, they perfectly fit the theme of Fortnite (again lemme know if there’s a better idea for a squad vehicle).

I fear when people think vehicles in Fortnite they think of regular cars, humvees, and/or some other armored OP vehicle. 

with these vehicles, players are still very much vulnerable to taking damage, they wouldn’t be gamebreakingly fast, once they’re destroyed they’re gone for the entire match, and there wouldn’t be a ton of them around the map. 

love it or hate it lemme hear your thoughts.

EDIT: for people worrying about the pace of the game changing.. these are naturally slow moving vehicles. and for the sake of the game they’d only be slightly faster than sprinting. the combination of that and how few of them would be on the map means the pace would barely change at all.",FortNiteBR

The idea. After the campfire is done give us the option to reignite it for 250 wood with a 5 second animation.

That way it's a risk because you can't do anything for 5 seconds. And it's expensive. 250 wood for 50 hp. It needs to be expensive because it already served its purpose once. If you want to get the powerful 50hp again there need to be consequences. 

You would also be able to reignite enemy campfires. This way they get some more use and can serve as a thing to fight over more.

Could even be used to reignite the ones that are already scattered throughout the map.

When this game is a few more months/years old, won't the skill gap between a new and experienced player be to drastic? And maybe push away new players Eg a totally new player playing against 99 others who have different lengths of experience, some being very experienced

BUT there would be a unique machine in the Tavern - a Slurp machine (Instead of beer on tap). The thing is, you have a 1 in 15 chance to receive one which leads to some players becoming more Triggered if they don't get one and you can only do it once per player. 

Sounded cool in my head and I think it would be a fun thing to add to the game. Thoughts?

Happy gaming all!

I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but I just need to vent. Every game, and I mean EVERY game, I get teammates with no mics, who hog every good item they see and then never use it, NEVER build and are always dying over and over again. All my teammates literally have like 2 braincells and their using them both on breathing. They can't do shit. And then I have to go into the fight that they started even though they didnt build a single piece of cover and kill the whole squad while they cower inside of a bush. I get at least one squad kill a game cause my team is always trash. Now I'm never toxic to them in game because that's just a dick move and plus that just makes them play even worse, somehow. Even if they're little kids I still treat them like they have some value to the team but the second that I go back to the lobby Im cussing up a storm over their complete lack of thumbs. And then by some miracle if I actually find a teammate with a brain, they never know how to build. Nobody knows how to build in this game. I guess that's my main issue with my teammates. They always sit there and waste all their ammo while I build the cover and then when the run out they don't build a single thing to protect while I get a squad wipe. I just want help in this game from teammates. Im tired of carrying every game. It was fun at first but now it's just annoying",FortNiteBR

I've watched a lot of different streamers since FortniteBR released. A lot of them have ridiculous aim and hand-eye coordination, but recently Ninja has stepped it up to a new level by embracing building like nobody else. I don't see any of the other top players using building strats the way he does... and of course I'm not talking about building a cool looking late game base to camp in. He constantly chases the action and uses building to gain high ground, defend against incoming fire, or to confuse his opponents. He routinely takes out multiple opponents coming from multiple directions simultaneously.

If you haven't watched him recently, I'd suggest [watching a couple games of his](https://www.twitch.tv/ninja) before declaring someone else is better. The way he is playing right now is different than what anyone was doing a month or two ago. It truly is next level play. If E-Sports happens, I don't see how he wouldn't be the #1 ranked player from the start.

My idea:

If a player takes more than 50 points of damage from a teammate, their loot doesn't drop.

Just like how when you jump off of the map, your loot teleports to the nearest player after 2min. This is the same principle. If a member of your team shoots you for 50+ damage (shields OR health) and you die, your loot doesn't drop and instead teleports to the nearest enemy squad after 2min. If you heal the damage taken by friendly fire, the 50 damage resets, so that way legitimate accidents are not punished. 

With this in place, there is no incentive for your teammates to shoot you for your loot, since doing so will only leave them a man down with the same weapons that they didn't like in the first place. People who continue to team kill will be reported and banned. This also creates a small skill gap for players to pick their shots more carefully.

EDIT: What is to stop teammates from abusing this and killing teamates so enemies don't get their loot? 

If the entire squad is wiped then the loot will teleport back to their dead bodies. Or make it so that the loot gets teleported to the player who downed / did damage to the teammate. ",FortNiteBR

As we all know they listen to community feedback, they update regularly, etc.  They've been great, which is why I've bought the Battle Pass and V-Bucks (I NEVER buy in game currency).

Long story short... I finished building my PC last night.  First PC I've had in 10 years.  First game I download is Fortnite, get on to play, and then I realize....

That your stats carry over from PS4!
I had assumed, that even though I had this sweet ass PC now, I would still be playing most of my Fortnite on PS4, so that my battle pass purchase wouldn't go to waste.  I thought ""maybe by Season 3 I'll buy the pass on PC instead...""

My brother plays on PS4 though, so I thought even in Season 3 I may still have to buy the pass on PS4 bc that's where he plays.  It's going to make it so great that I can now play PC pretty much all the time, then when he's on and wants to run duos I can just jump on the PS4.

Now, this may not be a huge deal to other people, but it was to me.  I felt like a little kid who just got a huge surprise present when the screen loaded up and I saw my level, my knight, and my Battle Pass tier.  It didn't even click for a minute, then I was like.. ""Wait... what?!?!""

We are not aware of any false positives  (only two historical exceptions were the swingset bans on 10/8 and the SMG bans on 11/20), but there is potential for confusion so here is some detail on how the system works:&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
We kick and/or ban players and machines based on the game being modified / tampered with, cheat software found running while playing Fortnite, and other ways of cheating.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; 

We then kick users that play on machines associated with previously banned accounts to prevent cheaters from returning to Fortnite.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
This means if you share a machine with a roommate or sibling and he/she cheats, your account won’t be able to play on that machine either. You can play on a different machine though.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
While we won't comment publicly, we have a team that investigates reports of false-positives (both ban and kick) found in our support and social channels (ie. our forums, reddit, etc.) to confirm our systems work as we expect.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
We know we need to improve how we message kicks and bans as the presentation can be confusing to players. Especially in light of temporary bans for code of conduct reasons or IP / VPN used.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

We also kick players from matches if they experience network conditions that are detrimental to other players. This is using the same mechanism as our general kick system and uses the same message. This needs adjusting.

I loved the idea of one life only, last man standing, and everyone starting with nothing.

I googled battle royale games for console because I didn’t have PC, and found Fortnite was my only option on PS4. Was quickly disappointed when I found that it was more cartoony looking and had this “stupid building crap” as part of the game... was going to just blow it off and keep waiting for PUBG to come to PS4, until I saw the game was free and decided to give it a shot.

This game has been the most fun gaming experience I think I have ever had. With hindsight, I would easily go back and pay full retail for this early access game and would think nothing of it, but had it not been free I would have missed out on it.

Anyone  else with a similar experience?

Will add that the “stupid building crap” is one of my favorite parts of the game now, and as I’m getting better at it, has greatly improved my enjoyment of the game. ",FortNiteBR

Hey, everyone!  I'm a Call of Duty YouTuber named Tabor Hill, but I'm absolutely in love with Fortnite.  I play on console currently and in particular the PS4.  As much as I love the game; however, there's one glaring issue when it comes to building.  It's slower than on PC.  Much slower.  There's several reasons for this, namely that we can't bind keys on console and thus we can't instantly place items.  Instead, we have to cycle through them, which causes a stuttering and input delay.  I'm sure most of you have noticed that when you swap from the wall to the stairs you have to cross through the pesky floor base -- and sometimes this can even stutter and stick, leaving you build a floor in the midst of battle instead of stairs.

About two weeks ago I made a post on here asking Epic if we could get the order changed, i.e., make it so it goes:  Wall, STAIRS, floor base, pyramid.   It got upvoted to the front page, but no Epic response was had.  In that topic, someone mentioned to me a tip I was not aware of.  You can somewhat do this yourself, as all the tools are already in game.

In order to achieve this effect, you swap to the pyramid structure and hold circle (or X-Box equivalent) to edit.  Then, select the first two squares closest to you and confirm.  Next, simply rotate the piece twice and it'll be identical to the stair piece.  In addition,  you could also select the back two squares instead and achieve the same results without having to rotate the piece.  If you've never edited a piece before, once you do so, the next time you bring up the building prompt it'll remain in place.  So now everytime you bring up the pyramid, it'll be the new modified staircase.  This is identical to the normal staircase in every way.  

My specialty when it comes to Call of Duty videos are elaborate challenge guides, and I've used those skills to create a tutorial video on exactly how you go about doing this process.  Also in the video, I prove that it can almost double your building speed (with timed examples, of course).  Lastly, I compare a clip of the popular streamer, Ninja, building an 11 piece structure in the heat of battle.  I then mimic this build on console and time both of them to see if console players can compare even remotely to PC players in the building department.

If you're a visual person or just want me to walk you exactly through the process, you can find the link at the top of this post or [right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9tQqIamkM8)

I have had this idea for quite a while and I am never on the reddit to see if it has been posted, so please forgive me if it has been posted before. I think if we do not have a building supply that we should not be given the option to swap to that material. Let’s say I have 0 wood, 100 stone, and 50 metal. When I go to build, I feel it should default to stone for my building material. When I go to swap, it would then go to metal. When I go to swap again it should go back to stone and skip over wood! There have been a few times when I have needed to panic build or finish off some launch pad stairs and I am out of a certain material and it costs me a second to figure out what I need to use. TL:DR Don’t let us try building something with materials we do not have.

Mostly the named elements X are too big or have a function (chest). So instead of destroying them your platform or ramp is just built through them like you do with normal terrain.

“The game was free.” I know, and I’m not taking that for granted. I was dumbfounded when I heard it’s free and in this generation where nothing is free, I didn’t even believe it. I thought it was a glitch and downloaded it as soon as I could before this “glitch” was fixed. I felt like Charlie running home to his family after winning the golden ticket in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

I bought Cod WW2 and Assassins Creed Origins during Black Friday and have played them both a decent amount, but once I started playing Fortnite, it has seriously fully dominated my playing time. It’s so fun and addicting. I can’t believe that after hundreds of matches in only 1 map, it still hasn’t gotten old yet. Every game is exciting and new because of the unlimited different outcomes (where you can land, what you’ll find, what you’ll build, etc.)  everytime.

The downfall, as many people know, is the pricing of v-bucks. I’ve heard it already. I’ve only been in this sub less than a week, but I’ve searched a bit and I’ve heard most of what I think you’d say already. So let’s go:

**“The game is free”**- That’s awesome and I don’t take it for granted, but seeing how much I love playing this, knowing how great it is, I would’ve easily without question paid the full price of a standard game ($60 plus tax).

**If you’re willing to pay $60 for the game, why don’t you pay that same amount in v-bucks currency?**- Something just seem so off about that in my mind. Based on this post, me feeling like Charlie running home when I found out the game was free, and buying cod and ac on Black Friday, one can see that I’m not the richest guy in the world. I’m never in a rush to buy anything so I like to see the best deals and opportunities. I can’t justify in my brain to spend that amount of money on cosmetic items that give no competitive advantage. 

**So just don’t buy it...**- Yeah, obviously that’s an option, but I don’t want to look like everyone. I like their designs, especially some that I’ve missed out on before I started playing like the lumberjack, the gingerbread man, and the guy who looks like a nutcracker in the Queen’s Guard, darn. However I probably wouldn’t have bought them anyway at $20 a pop. So yeah I don’t have to buy them, but then I feel that I would maybe get bored of the game and become selfishly jealous and envious of others. No one wants that. 

**”They’re priced right”**- I think that’s an obnoxious thing to say. You don’t know anyone’s financial situation. I don’t play too many video games, but I find it hard to believe that any game charges that much for 1 damn skin. I would never say they’re priced right because for me they aren’t. It goes both ways. I’m not saying they’re priced wrong for *everyone* because some people can afford them without even thinking twice, but for me it’s outrageous.

I may leave some others off this list because this post is already so long, but look all I’m saying is this is crazy. I still thank Epic for the job they did and offering it for free, but there’s certainly an asterisk next to that unfortunately. I’m not a businessman and I’m not a game developer. It’s not my place to say how this should or could be fixed, but from the outside looking in, I find it hard to believe that this system in place now is the most profitable course of action Epic could’ve taken. 

Epic, thank you for the amazing, and I truly mean AMAZING game. Now I just ask that you figure out another system that could make everyone happier.",FortNiteBR

But even with playing with kids that didn't had it, I still saw a change in the numbers of rounds I can finish by being eliminated by a real enemy. 

The thing is, no friendly fire is more of a burden, it make players careless, throwing bombs and stuff, instead of planning, Epic removed a form of strategy and sometimes mistake we can make like when I was passing in from of my friend to get a better shot and he killed me.

For those on the fence with the battle pass (I know I know.. It's too late to get the black knight) or those debating spending money to buy that dope new skin, consider the following: We've all been to the movies, and we are no stranger to the cost. 12 bucks for a ticket, 5 bucks for popcorn and a drink ( at least!) I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you brought your girlfriend, that's 30 bucks! Now, a movie provides you with what, 2 hours of entertainment? I know I have pumped WAY more than two hours into Fortnite (try 50 times that) so for me, the decision was easy! It's all about the amount of enjoyment you get out of a product! 10 bucks is a drop in the bucket for a game of this magnitude.

But it's getting increasingly more difficult to choose what to keep and what to toss. So I wanted to ask reddit what they think, do we need more slots than the current 5 we have now? Increasing it to 6 or 7? 

I suggest adding a med slot where only 1 type of healing item can be slotted, so you could only carry a stack of Medkits OR Bandages OR Shieldpots etc. We can also further limit the system by making sure that meds can no longer be placed in the other slots, it would only swap with what is currently in the med slot.

The new slot would look something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/sMUtQmy.png)

It's quite simple. There are far too many people here on the subreddit that don't support logical ideas or any form of intelligence other than the idea that they need a crutch and will do anything to get said crutch. Over the last month or so I have seen countless suggestions that will and could seriously ruin this game. It *is* up to Epic Games, although the community of this subreddit have a large say in what can be added to the game. That's why we have boogie bombs, mini shields, camp fires. Yes. a lot of good has come out of the subreddit although things I have seen get upvoted for exposure blow my mind. 

Why do we need a juice that makes us run faster to outrun the storm? What's the point of that? Oh, it's because you have no map awareness and keep getting hitched up looting or fighting. Well change that. 

Why do we need a grenade that instantly revives teammates? I don't even know where to start with this idea. This one absolutely blows my mind. Are you upset that you've died reviving a teammate because you made a poor choice to revive than fight? So you want an easy button to get better and hope that it gives you that grain of salt worth of a win to keep you playing?

Why do we need mini shields to stack to 10? 250 shield that can't be lost from fall damage? Perfect! Actually wait! 50 shield in 4 seconds! Quicker than a normal Shield Potion. 

The ideas above are thanks to reddit bitching and whining because they either died due to a user error, or got lucked out on and others decided it's time for them to bitch and whine too. 

It's a BATTLE ROYALE people, let's not let this game turn into a glorified robolx please. 

Not only is this a call to the community to realize that this can hinder the game and absolutely destroy it, but this is a call to Epic Games to do the right choice for the game's future, and the game's E-Sport future.

Lastly, please do take this here:

We have 30 million total players, and about 1.3 million concurrent players. At the subreddit's current rate we have 115K players. Roughly 10% of the actual games population. So 90% of players are just playing and having NO say in what gets added into the game or changed. So Epic Games, PLEASE do think about this. I am not saying every idea on the subreddit is bad BUT, ideas that SERIOUSLY change the meta of gameplay should be thought over seriously OR used an in-game voting system for players with 200+ games.s



*Note, take a look at Rust over the years, the developers listened to their subreddit and it KILLED the game we all loved.*

I've replied to these threads a couple of times suggesting to have ricochet damage instead but no one seems to be interested in that idea.

Can someone explain what the true downfalls that ricochet would be because to me it seems to be the perfect solution. When you shoot your teammates they take no damage but you take damage instead. Sounds like the most effective way to stop team killing to me and still keep the game balanced. ",FortNiteBR

To be clear, I can ensure that he doesn’t cheat. Moreover, he is nice guy and I couldn’t imagine him raging or flaming in the game. 

So, it raises a question how works this report system. Probably, devs do not rewatch plays of reported guys. Another theory: auto ban system bans everything who has got more than 15report. gg

But when you kill me after that, for what? Taking all the common guns that are left? Picking up some ammo caches you ran past 3 times? Why teammates?

Note: I report those players, but hell have I ever received a note that those awful people got punished.

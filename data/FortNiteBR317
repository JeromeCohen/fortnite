Of course there are exceptions, many of them I'm sure. But how many of you out there have played a 50\-v\-50 or 20\-v\-20 and not healed your teammate, (your own teammate!) instead just running straight past them and getting killed by the exact same guy who killed the guy you ran past. Why?? Because to be an a\-hole who plays fortnite you also have to be a  complete noob!

Or how about this, playing squads with randomers, like 30&amp;#37; of these people all want to go to tilted. OKay, fine, you want to go to tilted? Let's go to tilted. I do sure hope you can hold your own there though because I'm not good enough to carry you, and especially not 3 others. Oh what's this? You're dead??? Damn man it's been less than 10 seconds and you, who was shouting down the mic 'Bro! Bro! Tilted! Bro what you doing man go to Tilted!! Bro! BRO! BRO!' until I eventually caved in to the fact that if I don't go to tilted I'm gonna be alone in Squads which is just demoralising. Oh what's that? same fucking situation. Every fucking time. EVERY TIME. 

Are you one of these a\-holes? Go look in the mirror... Yes, you. Do it, do it now! If you think you're a good player, but you land in tilted and die 19 out of 20 games, and run past your own team members instead of healing them on ANY occasion provided it is somewhat safe to do so (which 90&amp;#37; of the time it is), then you aren't a good player.

Single pump took skill and was a high risk. You went for big damage hits and one shots because the pump time is so long if you missed, you were dead. This made the pump a pile of shit, might as well change the rarity back to grey and green because that is how effective it is.

All this change did was further encourage the double pump/heavy strategy. I for one don't think this meta is good for the game as it takes a good bit of skill out of fights. It gets rid of the risk element of the non tac shotguns and makes the tac obsolete.

I am fine with the body shot nerf because that just increases the skill gap.

___________________________

I feel like a better nerf would have been to completely get rid of the double pump/heavy strategy. Also, make  perfect pump headshot where all pellets hit do a clean 200.

This would make it so a one pump would require literally perfect aim where every pellet hits, and extreme cqc. That is balanced and keeps the pump a deadly high skill weapon.

______________________________

Also I feel like the tac was nerfed a bit too much, with its limited range and high spread a damage nerf is not what it needed. Now the heavy is just miles above everything else which doesn't make sense considering a blue AR is not that much worse than a Scar.",FortNiteBR

The thing is whenever I get into shotgun fights, I panic so hard I don't even know what I'm pressing and I keep switching between schematics and guns.

NOW there is the double pump again and It absolitely ruins the game. I never use the pumo because either I never hit the first shot or I get 9 damage headshot from 5m. My loudout is always reserved like this : 1) AR, 2) Shotgun, 3) Sniper, 4) Meds, 5) Explosives.

The whole point of the pump is the hard hit but slow shots, and I agree with epic on the multiplier nerf, it was too much and now the heavy shotgun is more viable. But now that double pump is abusable again, the tac is completely obsolete! And I get a disgusting feeling everytime I see or meet a double pumper. Because it's unfair and abusive. And the fact that if there is a player in a building and he can just faze through is absolutely broken. Countless times I have died that way and it is heartbreaking and rage indusing. 

Don't get me started on traps...

TL:DR

Double pump is abusive and a crutch.

Heavy shotgun is now viable because of reduced headshot multipliers on other shotguns.

Tac is obsolite because of double pump.

In a nutshell it ruins the game and my personal experience. There is no room to learn or catch up with skill because you either die to a noob with luck or get built on and 1 tapped by tryhards.",FortNiteBR

So I’d like to start out by admitting the fact that I am a very average Fortnite player, and by no means claim to be an expert. However, I am pursuing a graduate degree in sports science, and have taken quite a few classes on the psychology of sport, coaching, and training. In particular, I have spent lots of time studying the work of Dr. Anders Ericsson, author of the book Peak and perhaps most known for his work being the basis of the Malcom Gladwell book, “Outliers.” Ericsson has studied masters in a variety of crafts; chess, violin, javelin throwing, etc., and has discovered what makes these elite performers better than the rest. I bore you with all this background information to give some premise as to why I, an average Fortnite player, can help YOU get better. 

They key to Ericsson’s philosophy, and the key to becoming a pro at Fortnite, is **practice**. Now you might be saying, seriously? I read all this junk just for you to tell me how to practice? But in fact, practice is perhaps the most misunderstood thing we do to get better. There are two different kinds of practice – naïve, and deliberate. Naïve practice is simply repetition – repeating a task over and over again, to ingrain that muscle pattern into your brain. This allows us to have muscle memory, and perform skills reflexively. This is what most of us just call “practice.” The analogous sports task would be just hitting a tennis serve over and over again to get better. In Fortnite, this is just accumulating hours playing the game. However, I am writing this post to tell you that if this kind of practice is all you do, you will NOT get good at Fortnite (or perhaps anything). Now sure, certain things can improve with this kind of practice. You can get used to your keybindings, spamming panic walls when getting shot at, memorizing map rotations, maybe even improve your aim a bit. But, eventually you will get decent at those things, and then you’ll notice a plateau. Sure, you can now kill potatoes, but you won’t be able to take high ground against a good builder, you won’t be flick shotting everyone you see in Tilted, and you won’t be headshotting people from across the map. All you will do is ingrain your current average, or below average, Fortnite habits and skills into muscle memory. In the tennis analogy, if all you do is practice your average serve over and over again, you might be able to serve in the exact place every single time, but you’ll never add more spin or increase your speed. To learn more complex skills, and to improve your game, it takes the second kind of practice: **Deliberate Practice**.

Deliberate practice is a highly structured activity engaged in with the specific goal of improving performance. Now, some people divide this practice further, into un\-supervised (purposeful) and supervised/coached (deliberate) practice, but for the sake of online gaming we’ll lump the two together. The key with this kind of practice, is that you have a clear, planned out goal with every match you play. In the tennis example, it could be deliberately focusing on adding topspin to the ball with every serve. In the more relevant Fortnite example, this could be setting out to double ramp/wall every single person you run into for the next hour. You would take mental notes of why each one failed, why you were able to get shot down, etc., and try and fix that for the next repetition. After just a few sessions of this, you will be much, much better. Then, switch to another skill. This goes for almost any skill in Fortnite, and any skill in life. People overrate the amount of hours spent on something (in fact, to the chagrin of Ericsson, the key takeaway to the popular book Outliers is just that you need to spend 10,000 hours doing something – when in fact it is HOW you practice that matters much more than how much). Take this advice, and just spend the next 5 gaming sessions deliberately working on a specific skill. You’d be surprised how much better you can still get. ",FortNiteBR

I'm just interested to hear your thoughts. Do you miss the ""old days"" of Fortnite? I for one miss the old menu music terribly. The nostalgia when I hear that music is quite astounding. It just made the whole Fortnite experience feel so mysterious. 

Players getting better at the game is inevitable. That's something myself and, I'm sure, many others are willing to accept without allowing it to deter from their enjoyment. Bugs and weapon inconsistencies *seem* more prominent these days, but that's just my opinion.

However, a whole class of weapons aren't included in fortnite, the melee weapons! My first recommendation would be a Woodcutters Axe:

Green-Purple Rarity

40-75 Damage per swing on Players

150 Damage per swing to structures and 300 on target hit

Makes significantly less noise than a shotgun

Takes up a backpack slot

*Effects on metagame*

Allows players to sacrifice a backpack slot to gather resources more quickly - something people have been vocal about since Epic nerfed resource gathering

Its niche is that it allows players to deal huge damage to buildings without sacrificing ability to deal out damage in melee range, adding an extra element to build wars

Buffs stone and metal in build wars as they would take longer to take down (1 hit wooden walls, 2 hit stone, 3 shot metal (or 2 shot with a target hit)

Obviously needs to make melee contact to do damage, thus is hard-countered by SMG as you're completely exposed while using it. Pump shotgun would hopefully be indirectly nerfed as you could be 3 shot before you can get 2 pump shots off. Tactical and Heavy would have a similar TTK to the axe

Encourages a stealthy approach eliminating enemies one by one without alerting everyone else

Purple will 3-shot max hp enemies similar to tactical shotgun. Green will 3-shot 100hp enemies for early game.

Potential for hilarious videos of axe-murdering no-skins

Here's Johnny (Wick)

Epic, I know and understand that, supposedly, all updates and changes you do are to experiment with various environments and to buff weapons that are not being used often, but some of the decisions you took recently make absolutely no sense and do not cater for which portion of your players really matters.
* The whole community has agreed upon the traps not needing to be ANYTHING other than 100, no reason for a prolonged experiment on its viability or how it should be used.
* Everyone agrees that what differienciates fortnite is its building mechanic, and we're all here to learn to build and excel at that aspect which in turn will make us better at it overall, hence there is no need for a quickfix to being sh*t at building through a jetpack, or hugely nerfing the amount of mats available for use. Please, once removed, do not bring back the jetpack AT ALL, and try to find a better middle ground for the amount of mats given through farming or picking up (higher than current after update) so that running out of them in an end game fight becomes rare.
* I know C4 was being underused, but turning its radius to 600 is frekaing crazy! I cant tell how many times a person landing on a roof, finding a c4 and some crappy weapon when I got a shotgun from the first floor wins the battle simply because he throws ONE c4 anywhere, and the WHOLE house collapses, I am not even exagerating. If an item is being underused, perhaps it doesnt belong in the game or it doesnt serve much purpose instead of assuming it is weak and buffing it to the extreme! C4s goal is to make local small damage mostly to structures, not to bring tilted towers down.

I know your goal is to fix the game and come up with best possible adjustments, but sometimes few steps can be cut short and I urge you to not take the path of catering to small casual players because not those are the ones who will stay and play the game for long to come! Most new casual players have never played a video game ever (I have many examples in my friends) and they just jumped on the bandwagon of Fortnite exploding, but I assure you they will get bored and take off soon. Never underestimate the power of people (loyal players) having enough or getting bored of uncoherent and illogical changes and taking time off or leaving the game.

Instead, you should focus on the REAL issues at hand, such as the fact to increase switching time so there's no difference between double pumping and single pumping, fixing the many building issues such as walls being placed far or structures not placing when after throwing nades and so on.

Sorry for the long rant, thank you for reading.

 This leaves the blue pump at a max damage of 190. Still a very strong weapon, but not enough to one shot a full health/shield opponent.

BUT I love playing FortniteBR and I manage to get in around 15 hours a week. I'm probably a better-than-average player (around 400 wins across all modes) and I'm around Battlepass tier 75. I squad up for xp bonuses whenever I can.

I'm still only lvl 57 right now. To be considered ""on track"" to hit 80 for the chest piece by the end of the season you should have been at lvl 62 (half way to 80) on Tuesday or Wednesday (the 5th/6th) and I'm not even close, considering im at around 10k exp per lvl.

Now here's the meat of the issue. I'm fine with there being good rewards for players who play a lot. I wouldn't mind if there were an awesome lvl 100 skin that I would never get. My beef is that there is a reward that only players with more time can get, but it's tied to a reward for players who only have time for challenges every day and maybe some weekend grinds (Tier 100 Battlepass). I really don't think I'll make it to 80 considering how behind I am, and it sucks that I'll essentially have an incomplete skin set.

TL;DR It sucks that I play as much as I can and will still probably end up with an incomplete OMEGA at the end of the season. High lvl-based rewards should be separate from Battlepass rewards. ",FortNiteBR

Ok, so Ive been thinking about all the amazing skins in the game and the past, present, and what could be the future of fortnite. And I thought, ""boy i wish i couldve care enough about the game back when skins were first added or for seasons 1 or 2, because some of my favorite skins were back in those days and i was just playing stupidly and didnt care back then. But I thought, maybe there could be a way for a very limited time only, im talking less time than daily shop limited, for free or for a small amount of money/vbucks we could have ONE singular choice of a skin from any point and time of fortnite. If for free, make it even more limited and maybe even have some skill restrictions such as *20 wins to buy
*5 sets of weekly challenges completed
*tier 100
*level 70+
or if paying vbucks it could be 1,000 or 500 or maybe even 2,000 and a skill restriction.
All these restrictions, payments, and time to buy is for the fact of the main problem in this idea: NO SKINS! By far in my opinion the best meme in the fortnite community is no skins jumping around and doing nothing while your clearly right in front of them with a shotgun, and thatd be ruined if it was a skull trooper or a black knight as it is someone who has been playing for 5 days. And the entire concept of skins would be ruined in a sense of seeing your skin plastered on a bunch of people and the diversity of what you play would be gone. Hence the free+requirements or vbuck deal, this is just a little concept that ive been thinking over and im open to ideas, just please dont be rude, but in case you havent been following, heres a summary:

So I love double pump, personally I feel it adds a lot of pace and fear into the game knowing you have to get off your shots faster and more accurately before your opponents, this has also made me improve my aim drastically and even delve deeper into mouse sensitivity settings to really find what is good for me, not only has it made me react faster  but it also improved my tactical thinking, counting how many bullets they have shot, they’re height positioning and also the best way to build efficiently and quickly against someone who is rushing with double pump. I’m no pro gamer or on the level of someone like ninja but from season 1 to now the double shotgun meta really has made me such a better player, not just because I use double shotgun but also how to counter it, staying calm in tight situations and just becoming a better player overall. 

I feel without double shotgun, this game would lack that “rush” feeling and I would of not improved at the same rate that I have over these past 4 seasons.

Loot Lake starts to get fuller and fuller, with sandbags and flood defences being added to the map. But it’s no use; the rising water levels are out of control.

The water is diverted to Dusty Divot, which fills up via a long trench from Loot Lake. That’s when the weird growls and groans, audible from all over the map, start.

Now going back to the main topic is in why they whould do this now?Simply the meta before the patch is shotguns so saying this nerf is necessary but the problem with this nerf is it goes well with shotguns inconsistency.Pair a grey tac with inconsistentcy in the dmg and you find yourself damaging him from 30-60 as an average player

To simply put it the nerf should be more focused on the pump and not the tactical since the tac was in a decent position and with the nerf both shotguns are almost undoubtebly worse than the heavy 

TLDR: The shotgun nerf is unnecesary because the inconsistency of its damage lowers the effectiveness of pumps and tacticals while heavy is the most superior with most damage and a better fire rate than the pump",FortNiteBR

I feel that a cool idea for competitive games would be to spawn everyone with a common pistol that has 16 ammo and 100 shield, this would make it so that everyone has an immediate fair chance once spawning in and players could have more freedom as to where they want to land.

I play Squads because I like the challenge, and I like the teamwork. I don't have friends who play the game and I have yet to get any responses to any LFG post. I'm stuck playing fill, and overall it's probably the worst experience in a matchmaking environment I've ever experienced. I would say less than 5% of my games start off with everyone dropping together, looting up, fighting as a team, and making it past the drop zone.

Why is this?

I want to list the biggest roadblocks to enjoyable squads experiences that I've encountered over my play time:

- **Dropping in random locations:** This is my biggest annoyance so far. Squads should be taken a bit more seriously than solos or duos with your friends, people squad up to try and win and get better at fighting and building, and they want teamwork. If you see someone put the first marker down in the lobby, they are probably going to drop there no matter what. You can try to talk to them and ask if they could drop here or there instead, but if they don't acknowledge you or decline the suggestion, it's up to you to drop with them. Odds are if 2 markers go down in the same spot, the rest of your team will follow. Dropping together lets everyone on your team have the best chances of surviving the drop and getting looted, so you can move on to the second stage of the game and get closer to that W.

- **No communication:** This is partly Epic's fault. The most recent update broke voice chat to where you have to disable your mic and voice chat, then re-enable your mic and voice chat in almost every new lobby. Also, some people don't have mics, it's a tragedy yes, but this is the same in every competitive game - the difference is they allow for text chat with your team. It's not the best, but it's something we need in Fortnite. The part that isn't Epic's fault is when you hear someone with an open mic, talking to their friend or someone in the background, but they do not acknowledge any calls or give any information to the rest of the team. If you have a microphone, you don't have to talk and be friends with the team, but you should let someone know when you see an enemy team, or when you start engaging, or if you have an item someone else can use. General information like that can make the difference between being prepared for an engagement and taking the fight as a team, and getting picked off one by one.

- **Pick up your downed teammates when it's clear:** This is very common for me, someone gets downed and the rest of the team just leaves them to die. Even if you have a complete new player bot status teammate, having an extra person alive and shooting at the enemy can change the tide of battle in your favor. Don't go revive someone as soon as they are down, but when the coast is clear or if they got sniped from a far distance, go build around them and revive them.

- **Share your loot:** If you have 2 medkits, and someone is at 50hp, for the love of fuck give them a medkit. You found 3 minis and a big? Shield up and drop the last mini for someone. That extra health or shield can keep them alive long enough to distract the last enemy for you to pick them off, or give them enough survivability to really help you guys out in a fight. Materials are easy enough to get, but if you have 999 everything, and someone says they only have 500 wood, drop them some brick and metal. If one person on your team can't build as long as the rest of your team, he's no longer an asset but a liability. He will get downed and now your team has even more to worry about.

Squads should not be taken as lightly as it is. I realize the game has no competitive potential when it comes to matchmaking, but if these problems can be thought about by each player before they hit the queue button, the experience will get better and will become more competitive. 

I think people play Squads because they don't like dying as soon as they land, and they feel like having 3 other teammates on the map will give them the chance to make it out of the drop zone and get looted, and then they treat the game like solos. Everything is different in squads. Engagements are no longer solo fights, they are team engagements that take coordination and communication, your loot is no longer your loot, it's a team pool of resources to help you eliminate the rest of the teams. These points won't make you win every squad game you play, but these are the biggest reasons for losing early on from my experience.

If you choose to play a team based mode, *please* play as a team.",FortNiteBR

Today I engaged another in a Pump dual right from the drop. We both had 100 health. I fired only once and so did he. I hit him first and he hit me second. I died. I had a Green Pump and I do not know if his was Blue. But I checked my Stats upon death. My Accuracy was 100% - 10 shots hit - 1 headshot - 80 damage to players. That doesnt add up.

Now on to the issue at hand, Epic seriously needs to optimize Mac gameplay.

Every single time I get into a shopping cart, my whole game freezes and I'm stuck on a blue screen. The game just generally runs better on Windows and the fact that my iPhone SE can run the game with no issues says that it's just a matter of neglect for Mac users.

To the Epic devs, take a look on the Fortnite forums and the subreddit. Many people have complained about this and all we ask is just to take some time to focus on Mac players so we can all have a good time. Thanks.

* So first off I think that the game was perfect between season 2 and 3, during season 3 Epic began to balance the game which was necessary at first but at this point I do not think those type of updates belong in this game.

* I also think that them balancing the game does not work either. One of my favorite competative games right now is Super Smash Brothers: Melee, I like it so much because it is consistant. Nintendo cannot update/patch that game and it just works. It has worked for 15+ years now and the game is still thriving. If epic wants to keep Fortnite alive I suggest they keep some parts of the game consistant, (ex: weapon dmg balancing/equip times) and instead of this they focus mainly on optimization and bug fixes.

* However this is not to say that all the changes they add to the game is good. I do think that turbo building belongs in the game and is a good change. Same with first shot acc. I think they should stop adding things like this though in order to keep the flow of gameplay the same.

* One of my biggest pet peeves with the game right now is the time it takes to equip the pickaxe. (It is literally the smallest change but it annoys me so much). I used to be able to walk in a room w/ a gun, quick switch to pickaxe, gather mats and leave, but with this change it takes longer for no absolute reason at all. I understand why this change was put in the game too, it was to fix the exploit where you could switch from your pick to a gun and mine materials faster, but I feel as if this is a very lazy fix and they could have done something more efficient, while instead they just took the easy route.

* The reason I brought up the pickaxe equip time was because the sole reason that that exploit was introduced to the game was because Epic began to nerf weapon equip times in the first place. If they did not change the times it took to take out guns this change would not have been made to the pickaxe and one of my biggest pet peeves with the game would not exist.

I understand not everyone agrees with me but this is just my opinion of the game and im just trying to extend the life of Fortnite as a whole.

I mean the core of the game is still the same, drop, find a gun, and eliminate the 99 people left. I also know that what a battle Royale game attend to be, even pubg have the same core. Every fight feel the same, build battle, get killed by a shotgun or blown up by an RPG. I know there are trying to make the game more fresh each update, no matter how much an update the game is still going to be the same. I fear what become of fornite where many YouTuber have no choice to play battle Royale because the amount of views there been getting. Although I have a dream that fornite battle Royale would change but sadly my dream has faded. There many die hard fan would get mad if anyone talk about fornite, that would ignore all the evidence. I don't blame them, we human tend to get blind when it time to judge our beloved. The idea of Battle Royale was a concept that came from a Japanese movie where high school have to eliminate each other to survive. Epic has done an amazing job capitalize on the idea and make an masive profit each month. But for how long do you think fornite battle Royale would last ? 1 more year, 2 years, forever. I really don't know I'm not god. I bring this question to say I realized a trend where most people have already given up on formite. 96% of my friends don't play fornite no more, there many reason why they don't play the game no more. Maybe they get bored of the game, or maybe their realized that video game is a distraction that have waste most of the time. I hope epic could answer my question is fornite dying ? ",FortNiteBR

Here is my proof as to why I think it’s going to be the blockbuster reward:

* The royal bomber skin was leaked on the first day of the season.

* The royal bomber skin is epic (purple) rarity, and it seems like Epic games likes to use purple skins as rewards all the time. (For example: twitch prime skin, all the battle pass skins are either purple or gold)

* The royal bomber has no official artwork. All of the other skins leaked had full-body artwork of the skin posing to accompany them, and then were quickly added to the shop. The only picture leaked of royal bomber is the torso up picture of his face. This supports that he is a reward skin.

* What other event is going on that would have a reward? The blockbuster challenges are the only thing.

I saw many people saying that the blockbuster reward isn’t even in the game files yet, because epic isn’t dumb enough to do that. But... maybe they didn’t consider everything and it’s been in front of our eyes the entire time?

Tell me what you guys think.

Well what if they added a different way it worked? Like instead of it being considered like a bullet where one shot does 8, 20, 50, 100 etc have it being pellets? So say each shotgun shot has 10 pellets ""Could also have more 20, 30\+"" and each pellet does damage so say 10 damage a pellet. You hit each pellet ""10 pellets"" and end up doing 100 damage to someone or if you hit 3 pellets you do 30 Damage. I feel like this system could be good because if you're doing 10 damage then you're missing shots and not actually 8 damage when you hit someone in the head. I just want these shotguns fixed and to be balanced honestly... Fortnite is such a great game and don't wanna see the community die and also the pro scene not happen...

With the tac shotgun it takes about 3-4 hits minimum to kill someone on 100 health, game also took a turn for the worse with dusty divot being added as it is just a deathtrap and the hop rocks make the gameplay feel bad much like call of dutys such as advanced warfare and infinity warfare.

On top of this by the time the first circle has fully come in there will only be between 25-35 people left making the game much more boring after your initial drop.

In my opinion to fix the game get rid of a few named places at a minimum tilted towers and dusty divot and replace them with a much smaller town or bring the factorys back, get rid of the hop rocks and jet pack and make the shotgun damage much more consistent as no one likes hitting someone for between 5-30 damage with a shotgun and finally make building materials harder to get so that people can still have build fights but it does not make building more important than find in most fights.

This would make the game so much more enjoyable for me as in the past month I have barely played the game as I seem to almost always die because my shotguns hit for no damage and as well getting finished instantly is also extremely annoying",FortNiteBR

I mean we've seen terrible additions come and go, but this just makes me not feel like playing for the first time since I started.

I mean look at the progression of Fortnite, players are clearly getting better. There are threads about ""i feel like there's skill based matchmaking"" all the time. 

I'm sure that you, the person reading this right now, has realized that the days of a lot of easy kills are gone. What happens when you take one shot at someone now? They spam build a 3x1 and start peeking. Being able to push that player and land that clitch 1-pump was a thing of beauty. It created a healthy skill gap.

What happened when your squad dies and you're in a 3v1 situation? If you're a better player, you can clutch a couple of shotgun kills and win that fight because you're BETTER than the players that you killed.

So I started organising it using the exact same rules and stuff as keemstar and everything was going great till someone told me that PS4 and Xbox One can't use crossplay together... this is a bit of an issue because (more people use xbox) there is a large number of PS4 players... how do I solve this issue? Do i ban PS4 players? Do i give out 2 prizes? If i give out 2 prizes what about PC/Mobile players?

In addition it’d be on “challenges” and there’d be a button which would say seasons the button is the tab that says “week 6” for example but wouldn’t link you to the challenges it would send you to season 2, season 3, and season 4, they would be tabs as well like the week 6 for example but would link you to the seasons it would show you the seasons and if completed it’d say completed like when you complete all the challenges in a week plus when  clicked on the seasons if completed or not you can see the battle pass items for that season plus the season you didn’t complete would be revisited if PURCHASED and COMPLETED the CURRENT season.

While being at it, I've built towards a nice record for myself (300\+ wins, WR 17&amp;#37;). However, the thing is: winning does not feel satisfying anymore. There's simply no gain anymore. I feel no reward at all.

In the beginning, it was excited to win, now I just feel like playing against myself instead of others. I start messing around with traps, C4's, grenades, just to entertain myself. And because of it, my hours spent on Fortnite are rapidly declining. Obviously, I can't speak on the behalf of everyone, but I can imagine a great majority having similar thoughts.

Since it's a competitive game (in the end, the last solo/duo/squad standing takes the win), there has to be a reward other than ""having a good time/laugh"". It simply sounds too fucking cheap Epic, pardon my language. Even FIFA games give you an amount of in\-game currency (coins) for every win and EA Sports still makes plenty of money. 

Would it be that crazy of an idea to reward the winning players with v\-bucks? In that way, people that play and win a lot, can at least save up v\-bucks and spoil themselves with new items from the Item Shop. Sounds like a fitting reward to me. 

How do the lot of you think about this?",FortNiteBR

1. Pump and Tac got nerfed so you dont have to worry about being one pumped while using the minigun close range. It melts people 1v1.
2. The changes to Mat drop rates are a HUGE boost to the minigun. You can no longer just build to protect yourself or you will run out of materials quick.
3. Increased small bullet drops. It is now 18 a stack, up from 12. May not seem like a lot, but \+6 bullets per stack adds up quick.
4. As if those 3 reasons weren't enough, the Minigun got its Damage buffed....again.

It went from a ""ehh"" to a ""must have"" item. If you are skeptical, test it out and see it in its glory before it gets nerfed. People and buildings just melt in front of it. I've already won multiple solo and squads games because of it.

What happend yesterday was just uncalled for and just wrong. No one asked for any of these nerfs and I think put the game at the worst it ever been. If Epic continues like this the game will die faster than it should.I think the way to make a better future is if Epic doesn't listen to the conmunity as much as they are because you have to face it the community is becoming cancer to Epic and I think Epic should stick to it's own picture for the future of the game.

The new additions, nerfs, and buffs of certain aspects of this game are a bit odd. But let's all SLOW DOWN and remember something for a second: THESE APPLY TO EVERYONE. Not just you -- everyone.  So I know everyone is posting about their opinions and mine will I'm sure get lost in the madness, but I'll throw in my 2 cents, partly for the sake of my current boredom at work.

Traps: 75 damage sucked. 125 was nice. 150? yeah it's a bit much. But guess what? I've been playing this game since October of 2017 and I can honestly say I've probably only been hit by a trap around 25-30 times. In the THOUSANDS of games I've played. And of those 25-30 times, I've only been killed a handful of times. If you are not able to be aware enough to check the ceiling of a house that has already been looted, the ensuing 150 damage is probably well deserved.

C4: before the buff, C4 was just about useless. Unless you had an extra inventory slot early in the game, it wasn't even given a second thought to be picked up. Now though? I will ALWAYS make room for that shit, barring the case that I'm already carrying an RPG or a nade launcher. The range on the throw is not preposterous, the ability to explode it while it's still in the air is awesome, and the fact that it only does 70 damage is really not that OP. It's a super fun weapon to use and it's a huge X factor in a build battle. And guess what? STILL, HARDLY ANYONE USES IT. I have had it used against me once. ONCE. So stop complaining about how effective it is and maybe use it yourself.

Shotguns: the shotgun meta has a long and complicated history.  We've witnessed the rise and fall and then eventual revival of pretty much all 3 types of shotguns.  The pump obviously has experience the most change, but it has always retained its powerful damage. So now Epic has decided to alter the shotgun meta once again.  And people are upset. Why. Why why why. No more one-pumping with 200 health. HALLELUJAH.  And finally the heavy shotgun actually lives up to it's rarity.  I'm all for the double pump btw, it's not a super easy thing to do and it takes skill (it's also still not as fast as a tactical shotgun js).  I don't even use the double pump and I'm still okay with it. Additionally, why doesn't everyone just stop whining and try a new strategy? The shotgun+tacSMG is pretty damn effective.  Adapt to the change. And an only -10 damage change at that.

Jetpacks: I hate them. So. Much. They suck. It ruins the very core principle behind Fortnite, which is the ability to build and fight.  Nothing is worse than being a decently skilled builder and assuming that you took high ground because your opponent didn't build, only to have him suddenly appear above you and shotgun you in the head.  And yes, I know there are people who say ""if you're good enough you can outbuild them stop whining.""  Okay. Cool.  I am not a top 1% player. I am a good player but I am usually not fast enough at building to build up faster than a player who can literally just float up with the press of a button. But Epic is removing them (thanks Epic) and the issue will be over soon. Nuff said. (yeah I complained a bit here oh well)

Materials: yep the decrease in the amount you get in chests and floor drops sucks. But they suck for everyone, not just you. Still a level playing field in that regard. And also, it's really not THAT drastic. I try to farm everything in sight when I first drop.  I don't rely on floor drops or chests for the majority of my materials. Be aware, be strategic, and be more wise about how you use your materials. If it means less spam building when you first get shot at, so be it. Adapt.

Minigun: I can't believe people actually have a bone to pick with the minigun buff. Do you know who uses a minigun? NO ONE. Okay that's an exaggeration but seriously, unless it's the only gun available when you first land, the gun is just not worth using. Duos? Ehhh you can make it work.  Squads? Decent weapon to use while your squad rushes. But solos, people come on. It's a joke. Really? You get killed, let alone even attacked, by a minigun enough to the point that you need to whine about it? Sheesh.

Hop Rocks: it is really not fun to have to fight someone who can jump 2 stories above. But crack rocks are only available in certain locations. Know the locations  and stay lowkey when you're passing through them.  They probably could last a bit less than they do right now, but it is what it is. They're not as OP as jetpacks, they don't last as long as jetpacks, and you can outbuild players who are using them.  Yeah you'll probably lose more times than not, but such is life. Hop rocks are available to everyone. Everyone knows where they are. If it's a problem, land near them and get one before someone else does.

Llamas: I don't understand this nerf. I don't like it. But 600 total materials and possibly some shields are still not bad. Better than nothing.

Finally. I would like to personally thank Epic Games. They have given us nearly everything this whiny, needy community has asked for.  These changes, we made them happen. Like it or not, Epic is just listening to the community and responding accordingly.  Maybe it's not EXACTLY what we asked for, but Epic also is very good at reverting changes if they get enough negative feedback.

That's all I got for now. If you took the time to read through all this, I appreciate it. Please share your agreements/disagreements if you have any, and please keep it civil.

The game is so radically different from S3 / S4, and especially solos have become mindnumbingly boring nowadays, to the point where even streamers try to avoid solos as much as possible. Many people have talked about how it's a struggle to find someone, but the moment you fire a shot at someone or engage in combat, half the server is within few meters of you, trying to interrupt / third party you. The game increasingly penalizes combat, even though this is what makes it fun to most people.

Almost every weapon they've added for the past 2 seasons have been easier versions of the weapons they've replaced (Double Barrel taking the skill out of using shotguns, Quad Launcher being a more oppressive RPG, Heavy sniper being an easier version of the ""stock sniper"", new SMG's being spammier / less precise versions of the old SMG's, etc. etc.), and this has done nothing but add huge power spikes to the ones lucky enough to get one of the many new additions this game has had, in turn making the loot system feel more RNG than ever before.

And don't even get me started on swap delays, stairs that rotate randomly, turbo building not placing walls sometimes, no customizable crosshairs for 6 seasons (really fun when you're colorblind!) and so on..",FortniteCompetitive

This does work and can reduce the damage by quite a bit, but there is a way to reduce it even more. As soon as you place the ramp, you'll want to place a pyramid as well. The game will register the pyramid as a second story, and will reduce the fall damage *by up to 75%*. This gives you the same results as if you placed a Ramp, floor, and ramp, but it's way more consistent and easier to do. We did some tests and this is what we came up with:

​

5 stories high:

A drop to flat ground does 49 damage.

A drop onto the top of a ramp does 25.

A drop onto a ramp with a pyramid does only 12.

​

6 stories high:

A drop to flat ground does 98 damage.

A drop onto the top of a ramp does 55.

A drop onto a ramp with pyramid does only 34.

​

7 stories high:

A drop to flat ground kills you.

A drop onto the top of a ramp kills you.

A drop onto a ramp with pyramid does only 76 damage.

​

We've been playing the game since day 1 and watch tons of streams as well. Haven't seen anyone do this before, so we hope it helps some people out when getting knocked down in a build fight! :)

I've been playing Fortnite for about 3 months now and I'm having a lot of difficulty developing a good game sense and positioning habits. Most of my games play out like this. I land in a moderately populated area (Retail, Pleasant, Westworld) and I'll usually pick up 1 or 2 kills (or just die depending on loot) before looting the rest of the area and then leaving.

But I don't know where I'm going. 

I assume the basics of positioning are pretty simple? Get natural high ground, spot players rotating into zone, take a few shots and then push. If this is the correct way of playing the mid game then maybe I'm doing it wrong, because most of the time I'll either get third partied, I'll kill the other player only to be cleaned up by another, or I'll disengage and start the entire process over. Nowadays, I just ignore fighting completely in fear of being third partied and just camp the edge of zone until I get to the top 4 or 5, and there I'm more comfortable. It's just something about that 10-30 player part of the match where I feel like it's not worth fighting at all and I should just camp to increase my chances of winning. And I understand that such a strategy exists but I want to go fight people so naturally I want to learn how to engage, finish, and then rotate out of fights properly. I've been lurking here for about a month but there wasn't anything to specifically address this topic. 

On another note, does anyone think that rocket launchers are stupid OP and should only come in supply drops?

In many fights in the Alpha tournament i had highground, made edit plays for good oppoturnities to take shots, but couldn't deal enough damage. Most of my kills in mid-late game are done with traps, this just reflects my outplaying capabilities, but lack in aiming.

Big framedrops, strong motion blur and strong shadows are not helping either, i'm playing on Xbox One X and the shadows are around same as EPIC on PC. Motion Blur and dark shadows make me lose track of my opponent and hard to keep focus when aiming. This might be why controller players on PC might have easier time.

From Monday, 12:00am to Sunday, 11:59 pm.

Resets each week. 

Each tier has a certain item(Fortnite or reddit you guys come up with this) you receive after reaching the next tier(so people don’t cry)

Player with the highest points from each week should get a reward as well. 

SCORING: 
Placement - Top 10- 1 point/ Top 3- 2 points/BR- 4 points

Eliminations - 3 elims- 1 point/ 5 elims- 2 points/ 7 elims- 4 points

Bonus - BR &amp; 8 elims- 2 points 

IDEAS:

Once you reach tier 4 you should be put in a tier 3 lobby after not being able to find a match for 30 seconds. 

Fortnite creates a channel to stream tier 4 matches.

Have a tournament for the top tier 3/4 players after week three that lasts just as long as regular ranked season but only accumulates points with 25 matches only.

I went in thinking it would be easy to get 20 points, was only able to get 8. 

BUT! I have to say that this is probably the most fun mode I've played doing solo. It's kept me on my toes and I see it as a great opportunity to improve on my play-style as this is the only opportunity we've had to be pitted against people in our same skill range. 

I'm just writing this to suggest that you keep playing the Alpha tournament mode for the full 3 hours, even if you know that you won't be able to get the full 20 points. Because if your goal is to get better at Fortnite, (if you're subbed to this subreddit there's a good chance that is your goal), take advantage of this opportunity and learn from your mistakes and become a better player because you'll hardly get this experience when you go back to normal lobbies.

Remember that your not only playing good competent players but you're also player kb&amp;m users too. Naturally we know mouse users have a lot more control and ability to capitalize on aim. You could make the argument of aim assist but there are more variables that go into it than just ""Spam aim and shoot"". A lot of the time your off the ground when your shooting in a 1v1. So you have to be relatively stagnant to actually use aim assist. 

So if I could give any tips and this goes for myself too (personally I've gone agro the past two days because I've gotten frustrated and impatient) . I'd say play the angle. Bait the other player to come to you. Don't play Hyper agro like everyone else is. Calm down and play smart. Go for top 10 get easy kills and play it slow. Don't go for the show boat kills. Like jumping off your ramp and shooting someone. Don't do any of that. You'll end up getting punished for it. 

It's a tough life for us console players in this alpha tournament but don't get too down on yourself. Recognize what's wrong (format, cross platform, and naturally 3rd party elements of Solos) and do what you can with what you have to adapt. Good luck brothers!

Didn’t think you were exposed, shot to death. Missed a perfect opportunity for pump headshot, boom, dead. The list goes on.

On top of that, the survey then informs us that it isn't a registration, but registration e-mails will be sent out in order of when surveys were received.. Meaning people were scrambling to find a duo or confused in general as to whether they could just fill in a placeholder partner name, or if they should wait to submit the survey.

We haven't received any actual confirmation that registration e-mails have been sent out. I've only read and heard from various third parties that some people have received their e-mails. I've heard the ""first wave"" went out... but how many duos were in the first wave? How long do they have to register? When is the second wave?

Epic, you have a lot of people waiting around clueless as to whether or not they are going to be competing in an event that is happening in NINE days.

Ideally Epic should scale the damage for the shotguns the same as the AR's. The gold scar is better than the blue AR but only marginally when looking at stats, especially in the dps area. a gold heavy is 20+ damage over the blue pump and nearly 40 more than the blue tac. They either need to increase spawn rate of the heavy or make some damage buffs as suggested to the pump and tac. I wouldn't mind a slight increase to damage of the heavy as long as it doesn't go above 200. Also just the thought that the grey tac shotgun does 136 max to the head is sad. Ideal changes would be gold heavy: 198, purple heavy: 190, Blue pump: 180, green pump: 170, then the tacs would need some more thought as their rate of fire is much higher so maybe not exactly 10 for them. I just think that the state of shotguns is more rng because as stated the heavy is so significantly better than all shotguns right now. Also vault the double barrel, that thing is just a shitty concept of a shotgun and will never be correctly balanced-no shotgun should do 100+ to the body.

However, I think part of what makes fortnite so enjoyable and replayable is the satisfaction of a Victory Royale. There are few greater experiences I have had gaming than getting my first solo win after grinding hours and hours. Good players and bad ones both might argue that SBMM would make the game better  because it would allow the game to be more competitive given their skill level.  I think though that replacing regular solos with a system based on skill would kill the game.

After constantly getting wrecked when players got a lot better during season 4, this made me all the more addicted and motivated to improve at the game. Similarly, when I was a complete newbie in season 2, I wanted to get better so I wouldn't completely suck. Now that I am good, or at least decent (by this sub's standard you're not good unless you've got 2k solo wins) I like the game just as much as I did before, because I feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that all the grinding I did was worth it.

What I am saying is that with SBMM, no matter how good or bad you are, the nature of the system would make it nearly impossible to see a change in your win rate or KDR. This, personally, would demotivate me, as I would never see the results of my improvement. What do you guys think abput SBMM and standard solos? ",FortniteCompetitive

It gives opportunity to people that cannot play on that specific time of the day to finish what they started, especially if a pin was unlocked the first day. Today I wasn't able to compete because I wasn't able to reach there on time and now my pin from yesterday is useless, unless I am missing something. For someone it can happen to miss the last event due to work or something else. I feel like it's not only me that experienced this and it's frustrating at the same time when trying to squeeze some time out of the already busy schedule to play what they love.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to give players a choice, especially when announcing something this big one (or few)) day(s) before it starts. Not everyone is free to participate at that specific time of the day. If it's meant for everyone, then it should be available and suitable for everyone too.

122,l1am2350,1539800511,9p1833,40,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9p1833/ads_aim_lock_for_controller_is_alive_and_well/,1,ADS Aim Lock for Controller is Alive and Well,"First off, I’d like to clarify a couple of points

1. Aim assist for controller players is fair and a needed option due to dead zones and the overall lower precision present when using your thumb on an analog stick. Almost every other shooter has it. That’s not what I’m addressing here at all, though most discussions about ads lock that I’ve seen and participated in devolve into controller players arguing against a strawman who thinks they shouldn’t have any aim assist at all. 

2. This is, imo, very relevant to the competitive scene because not only have skirmishes been cross platform so far, but the new in game tournaments are cross platform as well.

I played fortnite on xbox using a controller until early season 5. It was the first shooter I ever took seriously enough to sink a lot of time into, and therefore the number one aspect I lagged behind on was aim. That is, until I discovered, through personal experience and then youtube videos, that my reticle “snapped” to a players head and gave me a guaranteed headshot if I hovered it over their shoulder, ads’d, and immediately shot. Not only that, but when tracking mid/long range with an smg or ar, repeated ads’ing would give better results than trying to use my right stick. 

I switched over to pc, and not long after I heard that ads aim lock had been nerfed. However, watching PAX it was obvious that Ayden was utilizing it with great results (along with being a great player). This was dismissed as being due to them playing on a previous patch of fortnite that was before the nerf, and I repeatedly saw controller users saying that the “ads then immediately shoot” strategy was no longer viable. 

I didn’t really think about it again until yesterday when I was watching Daequan’s stream and he plugged in his controller just to fuck around. He was quickly visibly shocked at how he “didn’t have to aim” when he ads’d, and how it immediately pulled his cursor towards the enemy. This was very obviously present both in close range shotgun fights and when tracking from mid range with an smg, where he said he literally didn’t use his right stick in exchange for spamming ads while perfectly tracking someone moving from his left to his right. I was surprised to say the least, tested it out myself on my friend’s xbox, and it felt exactly like it used to. 

Now, it could very well work at a shorter distance from the target than pre nerf, but I was able to hit flick shots to people’s heads with completely wack aiming from not touching a controller in months and not even having great aim before I switched, just by getting my reticle close and then ads’ing. 

If you don’t believe me, plug in a controller, go into playground mode with a friend (you have to switch teams), grab a pump, and ads while having your reticle over their shoulder. 

The only reason I’m addressing this is because it’s something that I see denied by controller players on reddit all the time, and something that I, and I assume most other pc players who knew about how it used to be, assumed was no longer a valid strategy after it was nerfed. 

So, I’d like to have/see some discussion about its place in fortnite without either its existence being outright denied or people acting like anyone thinks that aim assist as a whole should be taken away from controller users.

What do you think?


TL;DR
Unlike aim assist in any other game, you can still get a guaranteed headshot when using a controller in fortnite by hovering your reticle over an enemy’s shoulder, ads’ing, and immediately shooting. Do you think this is a mechanic that should remain?",FortniteCompetitive

But, when jumping, you can’t ADS and the significant difference between the sensitivity and ADS now feels way too big. 

How have you all dealt with this problem? If this was strictly a shooter, I would want to lower my overall sens even more, but I can’t due to building.

Doing some quick math and rough estimates and theory crafting. If you play for the full 3 hours, you should be aiming to get 

* ~1.7 points per 15 minutes
* ~3.4 per 30 minutes
* ~6.8 per hour

at this rate at the end of 3 hours you will be at ~20.4 points.

Reviewing my games, top 10 times happened 

* quickest: 6.75 minutes
* longest: 11.5 m
* average: 10.5 m

what this means is that if you have 3 kills and top 10, you're at 2 points at about 10 minutes. It might be wise to reset at this point. Reason being is that top 10 will play slower and on average you will find better players. Getting 2 more kills or waiting for top 3 may lead to a 20 minute game were you're no longer guaranteed to be ahead of the 1.7 points per 15 minute rate.

consclusion: 

* If a pin is your goal and you find it hard to slay out and win, aim to get 1.7 points per 15 minutes. If you drop 3+ kills and get top 10, reset, and aim to repeat this until you hit 20.

* if you're interested in getting better, play out every game. Some of the most fun build fights I've had were mid/late game of my games.

If you're consistently getting over 1.7 points per 15 minutes playing normal then you're probably already a solid player :P

good luck everyone!!

I'm not a native speaker and I AM VERY BAD at math.. I'll try my best to explain everything correctly and clear as possible.

So today I was super hyped to have another ""competitive"" gamemode or tournament tab I should say and waited all day to play and test it out. And to be honest, the first games were really fun, I had good end game zones with a decent amount of people alive and I got some skirmish vibes. After the second and third game, I realized that roughly 20 people were alive in **the first circle.** And the reason for that is the, let's say, not so polished point system. 7 kills gave you as much points as a win and people caught onto that and just hotdropped big POIs, hoped for 5+ kills, died and just kept on spamming games. It is the easiest way to get points. And I think it's sad, I understand that there has to be a kill incentive but it shouldn't be upfront. Afterall, Fortnite: Battle Royal is a survival game. May the toughest survive and win it all. Why not reward the **winner** the most? If everyone would start playing for the win, the matches would get a lot more intense, late game circles would be more stacked, you have to make smart decisions on where you drop, how you rotate, what items you want to carry etc. The game overall would be way more strategic and this is what I think is the most fun about this game, the strategic aspect of it. Not just landing, going in, get 5 kills and backout. I mean, to be fair, it's not that easy to get 7 kills. But it'd be a lot harder if people actually tried to go for the win, instead of kills.   


What I think is that Epic Games is trying to hard to connect the casuals with the competitive side of Fortnite, which I think is not neccessarily a bad decision but I don't think it'll work out. The casuals can still play their public matches, may it be squads, duo, solos or the featured gamemodes. But don't try to hard to merge these totally different sides but at the same time don't exclude one from another. I know it's hard to figure out a good balance and I am by no means blaming Epic Games, they're doing a good job and this a good start.   


Anyways, I want to show you guys a ranking system I came up with and want to know what you all think about that.   
I tried to think everything through and give reasoning to everything I came up with.   


My suggested point system (Note: this isn't for the Pro Skirmishes or the like, just for the ingame ranking system):  


* **Following placements earn ten points each: Top 15, 10, 5, 3 and 1.**   
So if you make it to top 15, you'd earn 10 points, top 5 would be 30 points total and if you get the Victory Royal you earn a total of 50 points. Having a more spread out point system throughout placements would encourage more players, especially in late game to stay alive and try to milk the remaining points.   

* As for the kill incentive, instead of only points, you get multipliers (they don't add up).    
3 kills give you a multiplier of **x 1.1 and +5 points,**  
5 kills give you a multiplier of **x 1.2 and +5 points,**  
7 kills give you a multiplier of **x 1.4 and +5 points,**  
Every other kill after 7 adds another **x 0.15.**   


Example: You place top 10 and get 6 kills -&gt; (20 + 10) x 1.2 = 36. That means for that performance you earned 36 points in total.  
With that point ranking there is a healthy kill incentive but they get more and more valueable the higher you place encouranging players to play to win and multiply their points.

Another example: You get the victory royal and get 14 kills -&gt; (50 + 15) x (1.4 + (7 x 0.15)) = 159 points.   
^((I really fucking hope I did the math right, this is super embarrassing and I know reddit will judge me))  


So there are two ways which I think could work:   


# 1. Keep the events/tournaments tab and have scheduled queues

If you keep it that way, the most important thing is to not limit it to a set timespan but rather to a set amount of games. For example, in our current tournament mode, we have 3 hours to get 20 points. This is wasn't Fortnite Competitive, this was a Fortnite speedrun. As I said earlier, everyone just dropped, got kills and backed out. The faster, the better. My solution would be to keep the schedules (set days where the queues are open) for tournaments but open the queue for more than 12 - 14 hours and have a set amount of games you are allowed to play. For example 8am - 10pm with a total of 10-15 available games. That way more people can compete AND people will respect the dying aspect of the game and can't just spam game after game. Also with the bigger timespan, it allows people to take a needed break, not everyone can grind for 3 hours straight. People burn out (atleast from personal experience). Then you can either choose to give away the pins to the top 100/250/500 of the tournament or give it to everyone who reaches an x amount of points. Also get matched up with people with similiar points to you.  


# 2. Have a dedicated ranked mode with leaderboards and based matchmaking

Honestly nothing much to say about that but one important thing is that being able to lose points is essential. I haven't figured out how exactly and how much but this is what the thread is about, so I'm looking forward for your suggestions and ideas. I thought of maybe somehting like, if you don't consistently place well you lose points. And obviously if you don't play enough or not actively, you decay.   


I hope everything was understandable and reasonable. And am looking forward for some discussions!  


tl;dr keep kill incentives but instead of making them just flat points, have them as a multiplier and reduce the total points you can get from kills compared to placements",FortniteCompetitive

Best way to practice in solos? Usually I just go straight for the big locations but I find that half the time whether I die or not depends on how good my RNG was and doesn’t do much in terms of practice.

I just played through the tournament system to earn my “shiny pin”. I made it to 20 points despite points not counting at first, but felt very little pride in doing so, as none of my games played like real competitive matches.

By the time the first circle had closed, there were fewer than 20 people in any of my matches.

This is a result of a system that does not penalize dying. A large percentage of every lobby would drop contested areas and rush for kills, leaving only a handful of players for mid/late game.

If a game limit were implemented (along with functioning sbmm), players would have to think  much more carefully about their drops and pushes, and we would likely see games that more closely reflect the pro meta.

This could be done in conjunction with a playtime window (you have x amount of hours to play y amount of matches) in order to keep mm wait times to a minimum.

As someone who was really looking forward to playing in more competitive games, today was a bit of a disappointment. Hoping epic will make improvements to the tournaments in the coming weeks.",FortniteCompetitive

Earlier today we launched the in-game tournament system and hosted the first session of the Alpha Tournament on the EU server.  We'd like to provide an update on several known issues, what we're still investigating, and what you might expect as we iron out issues within the system throughout the week.

**Server Capacity**

The sudden influx of players attempting to search for matches at the start of the tournament caused some issues with our matchmaking services as they attempted to balance match assignment in response to the demand.  We are updating our matchmaking strategy to better accommodate the rush of players at the start of a tournament.

**Schedule &amp; Tournament Regions**

An issue was identified where often the 'Tournament Region' displayed in the Events tab would indicate a player was viewing the event list for 'North America'.  This is a visual bug only, each region has their own tournament schedule and all times displayed inside of the Events tab are correct based on your local timezone and system clock.

**Incorrect Scores**

We have a couple known issues around incorrect scores:

Scenario one - players did not receive any points because they were not being matched into the tournament correctly - despite it appearing as if they were.  Restarting the game would fix this issue and allow you to earn points.  This should now display an error if you try to matchmake with this issue, and we’ll be fixing in a future release.

Scenario two - players may incorrectly either receive a point or not get credit for reaching an elimination or placement goal.  However, the correct score would be shown after a 2-3 minute delay or the next time a player returned to the Lobby.  We’re actively investigating a fix for this, but your score should be correct at the end of an event currently.

Unfortunately, any points lost during this event will not be recoverable.

**Matchmaking**

The tournament system is intended to match you against players with similar score during the session, becoming less strict in its search over time to ensure you find a match eventually.  Players who have higher scores should expect longer matchmaking times and tougher matches, while players with lower scores should expect an easier time as many of the higher scoring players filter out.

Currently we're finding that this isn't working correctly and is resulting in matches that are more mixed in score than we intended, especially when it comes to players with high scores during the event.  We'll be continuing to iterate on this to provide a better matched experience, so expect this to fluctuate regularly.

\-------------------------------

We're also keeping an eye on feedback for things like tournament scheduling, scoring formats, and visual presentation to help inform future development after we've gotten everything working as intended.  Dive into the [tournament system blog](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/esports/en-US/news/in-game-tournaments-announcement) and [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zSjJS2vSMA) for some insight into where we'll be taking the feature going forward.",FortniteCompetitive

Select Players from each Club will compete against one another in an ATK Grand Prix challenge and earn points for their club. The top performers at the end of the competition will be awarded.

All players in each club will be sorted into a 256 person single elimination tournament bracket. Each match of the tournament will consist of 4 players. Each player will need to party up with their designated opponents and jump into a playground match together.

In the match, each player will grab an ATK and head to the Paradise Palms race track. Line up correctly before the checkered line, and once the light turns green, the race is off! The 2 players in the lobby to cross the finish line first after 3 laps will advance in the bracket. The 2 that do not will be eliminated from the tournament.

On console we had a problem with building and editing. They fixed the building, now Epic is working for a solution to edit more efficient. They introduced custom keybinds for console but editing is still not 100% fixed.

On console your thumbs are always on L3 and R3. Unfortunately you can’t use the edit button like the confirm button.(Epic will fix this later)

If you for example use O for the edit button, you need to lift your right thumb to O after that you need to use your right trigger to select the squares and then you lift your thumb back to O. This takes forever to edit something compare to PC and you need to change your build mode button to something else.

My solution for this is:

First of all turn ON autorun in the settings. On Default L3 is for sprint if we use autorun, we have a button that we can use for editing. Change toggle auto run to Dpad Left.

This is much faster than other keybinds. This maybe makes you 1 sec faster but on competitive level is this very important.

For example you are fighting with someone. You place a wall between you and your enemy. After that you edit your wall (L3) -&gt; you hold your thumb on right trigger to select the 6 top squares -&gt; move your thumb back to O you confirm -&gt; jump (X) -&gt; shoot -&gt; reset your edit (L3) (R3). 

Do this again if you missed your shot, then kill the enemy and get the Victory Royale.",FortniteCompetitive

In other words, rather than using 1 finger to press space bar two times for peeking, he insisted that players bind crouch to one key and jump to another.  Having one finger on each part of the equation makes it possible.

This dynamic should be applied when considering building keybinds and weapon slot keybinds.  All building keybinds should have their own finger dedicated to them.  The time it takes to move one finger back and forth between two build pieces is a serious waste.

When thought about like this, your options for keybinds are pretty limited.  For example, Q (Ring finger) ,E (Index) ,C (Thumb) ,Mouse button (Other Thumb).  This setup utilizes the rule highlighted above.  These binds, in my opinion, are to some extent objectively optimal.

Combat Mode

A - jump (mapped to left paddle)
B- Edit (mapped to right paddle) 
Y- Toggle Pick Axe
X-Reload/Interact 
RB-Cycle weapons (Right) 
LB-Cycle weapons (Left)
RT- Shoot (Select)
LT - Aim down sight
R3 - Crouch 
L3 - Switch Mode

D- Pad is as standard

Build Mode

I have swapped the action of X to R3.

I now place traps with my right analogue stick.

Normal Combat Pro controls. I’ve turned on the option with turbo build where I do not have to confirm the piece I want to place. It instantly places now with the corresponding button press. 

Edit Mode 

RT - Selects the squares I want to edit
LT - Confirms my edit 
B (right paddle) - Reset Edit

(To return an edited wall, floor etc to normal all I have to do now is double tap my right paddle and it restores the piece to its original state. I then confirm this with LT)

These are really smooth controls if you have a two paddle controller. I don’t have to remove my hands off the sticks or any buttons to perform all the actions I need. 

Hope this helps if you try it out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First I want to start by saying that what most people experience is in my opinion performance anxiety rather than being nervous. While they are arguably circular and interchangeable, I see the main 2 differentiation's being: nervousness has no physical symptoms and is very broad while anxiousness has physical symptoms and is related to a specific event/thought. So if you are shaking or your heart is racing while you are in front of your class during a presentation, it is my opinion that you are anxious rather than nervous. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So with that, lets dissect why our body gets anxious in the first place. When you are anxious, your body releases stress hormones which is mainly comprised of cortisol and adrenaline. Your mind is imagining the event as a perceived threat and you develop a mindset that starts imagining all the possible negative outcomes that could occur. As the adrenaline pumps into your veins, you begin to shake which only adds to the anxiety because now you can't hold your cross hairs steady on your opponent. Next thing you know you choke and get ""take the L'd"" on for being a bot.

 

Well I have some good new and some bad news. The bad news is you will probably always have some form of performance anxiety whether is be from Fornite, public speaking, hell even going up and talking to strangers for some. The good news is that Harvard Business School did a study on performance anxiety and they came up with a few theories that worked very well in study groups. 

&amp;#x200B;

What they found was that anxiety and excitement have a lot in common. They are both aroused emotions where the heart beats faster, cortisol surges and the body prepares for action. They found it is much easier for someone to go from anxious to excited than from anxious to calm. The idea is that in an anxious mindset we are focusing on the negative possible outcomes while in an excited mindset we are more focused on the positive possible outcomes.  

&amp;#x200B;

So how will 3 words help me??? Well in the study, they had their participants repeat the phrase ""I'm excited"" to themselves over and over. After stating you are excited, start to analyze the opportunities that will arise from the event rather than the negative outcomes. So in Fornite, instead of focusing on how you will blow it, focus more on strategy and possible plays you see yourself making with the situation you are in. 

&amp;#x200B;

They found there was a 17% increase in performance in their participants when they did this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A final note I'll leave on is also the importance of confidence if your game play. If you are unsure of anything, you should be grinding that non-stop in playgrounds. Focus on your weaknesses until they become strengths. Confidence in your game is very important and plays a tremendous role in competitive play.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Best of luck everyone and remember, you are excited, not anxious.

A better system would be:

Maybe the highest level players have been cheated out of the rank they deserve. My trn is terrible because I constantly engage xim users. My credentials ? This season , top 3 minutes played in the us. It appears all of the xim users have taken the highest ranks . So in a game with millions of active players , xim players hold the top spots .

Since it uses heavy ammo though... I was thinking of a cool buff to slightly change the turtling aspect of competitive fortnite meta. Basically the damage to players would stay the same, but wall damage would be buffed 33-50%. This would allow for quick replacement of walls, similar to how the heavy sniper functions, yet not as strong because it is still rather weak against players. It’d be cool to start seeing every weapon have a unique purpose, especially the deagle because it’s is unlike any other gun.

Possibly even the worst item that ever was in this game.,"And, why is pretty simple. So simple infact that it annoys the frickety frack out of me that it even went beyond the idea stage, and it says alot about Epics complete lack of interest in keeping up with the more experienced players that actually took the time to seriously practice the various difficult to learn mechanics this game has to offer. Against the grappler most of that is just not relevant anymore. Plenty of times it isn't even worth shit, cause you can't always counter it.

When you start to play you learn that building is the key, the difference between good and bad players - it's literally IT. Everything that Fortnite has and does so well that every other game doesn't. Blackout looks good, but it's not close to Fortnite, because of building. Because you can always outplay. With. Building. Positioning is obviously important too, which, funny enough, the grappler completely counters aswell.

Again, adding the grappler is the biggest fuck you to anyone whos dedicated a shitton of time in playgrounds and regular games to learn both building and good positioning. Now anyone can just randomly land on a grappler, aim, and hello, you now have a person literally sitting on your forehead.

And it just feels so good! You literally just used 200 mats and careful planning to get an advantage, but I'm sorry, the guy you're fighting was lucky and got 10 free band-aids for his shitty positioning.

Ask any pro, and I'm sure they'd all prefer to vault the grappler and get bouncers back. Atleast the bouncers wasn't just a one click thing, you know? You had to understand how they worked, be smart enough to realize when you could use them, aand, there was always a chance that you'd get shot in the air cause you didn't move anywhere close to as fast as you do with the grappler. And how many times did you have 10 bouncers? Did you ever need to?

This really ain't it, Epic. Fortnite is obviously not dying, or anything close to that, but catering too much to the casual crowd and completely forgetting the tryhards is just bad overall and will not take this game to the next level.",FortniteCompetitive

All players in each club will be sorted into a 256 person single elimination tournament bracket. Each match of the tournament will consist of 4 players. Each player will need to party up with their designated opponents and jump into a playground match together.

&amp;#x200B;

In the match, each player will grab an ATK and head to the Paradise Palms race track. Line up correctly before the checkered line, and once the light turns green, the race is off! The 2 players in the lobby to cross the finish line first after 3 laps will advance in the bracket. The 2 that do not will be eliminated from the tournament.

Games run smooth and i almost never see/feel any lag when playing on 70-80 ping on other games (i'm referring to games like CS, BF and so). 
Fortnite though, feels so sluggish and laggy that it's literally annoying lol. Editing is horrible - it sometimes takes me several seconds to enter the editing mode and it seems like there is no fix. Building also, ghost shots, a lot of other mechanics that work very poorly if you have more than 10-20 ping. 
I understand that the game's mechanics are more complex that others, but still - why do i need to have a 10-20 ping to play the game smoothly? Many people can't afford such internet or simply don't have access to it which is actually annoying. Even when i get to play on 50-60 ping i feel edit lag and ghost shot too often.
The current development state of the game does not match the current average skill that player have, it just simply doesn't fit lol. The average player uses the edit function so much and it feels like they are not even trying to improve it by any way.
I see players like Mongraal or Symfuhny entering and exiting the edit mode as if there is no delay, and i wonder to myself if Fortnite is just incompatible with the average ping of a player.
Currently, where i live, there is pretty much no access to a ping lower than 50. A very small amount of people can access such internet. I imagine this is the scenario with many other places, and Fortnite NEEDS to change so it's more compatible with the average ping.
For a game as big as Fortnite - i belive Epic could definitely imrpove their game and particularly their editing system so players could enjoy it more. ",FortniteCompetitive

I made this comment on one of the posts. If you're struggling against Minigun spammers, maybe this helps.

#How to counter the Minigun

###**First technique**

Build with metal or brick (if you don't have metal). Try to get closer to him and then shotgun, build, wait for your build to get destroyed and shotgun again. Works best when you have grappler etc. When ramping towards your opponent, remember to build many ramps side by side and switch between them to take minimal damage while getting closer to your opponent.

###**Second technique**

Build with your strongest material. Back off bit to good AR range. Build wall + ramp and aim at your opponent, when your wall and ramp breaks, shoot. The first shot will be 100% due to FSA and then just keep spraying. You should easily win the fight against minigun with ar if you're bit further away from your opponent. 

###**Third technique**

Simply, disengage. Use your launch pads / grapplers to get around closest natural cover / inside buildings and run or wait for him to come close enough for you to beat him with shotgun / smg.


###General advice against Minigun:
- Build with your strongest material
- Look quickly for closest natural cover
- Remember that ar beats Minigun at good ar range. 
- Build, shotgun, build works well against spammers
- Smg does more dps than minigun
- Remember that Minigun has long pullout delay
- Try to make the spammer lose track of you
- Don't stand still, push closer or back off depending on the situation
- If you're worried about Minigun, remember to carry grappler.
- Remember that Minigun spammer is moving slowly and if you handle snipers, try sniping him to the face.
- Advoid long open areas when you're not comfortable with your mat count (general advice, not only Minigun)

Hope this helps, Miniguns are not that hard to counter when you learn to play against them. You should try to position yourself well before any fight you take.",FortniteCompetitive

408,VoroJr,1539452885,9nvnqf,41,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9nvnqf/lets_talk_about_burst_rifles/,1,Let's talk about Burst rifles,"Hey /r/FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

After giving it some thought at observing various pros (e.g. chap) who'd rather take a green full auto than a gold FAMAS, aswell as chipping in my own experience, I think the Burst rifle, though having been buffed a couple patches ago, still needs some love. Obviously I'd like you to give me your opinions aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

Back before the days without first shot accuracy, the burst rifle was still the go to choice of many simply because back then you couldn't rely on your full auto shots to hit long midrange and long range when you only wanted to peek for a short time. Frankly, back then it was better to peek, deploy one burst, and then having three bullets go out quickly which gave you a better chance of hitting one. The meta was also different - build fights were prevalent everywhere. Shooting down structures wasn't very important. Additionally, it was a good switch after a shotgun shot before smgs were used, quickly finishing off an opponent with the three bullet salve. All in all, back then the burst rifle had its niche as a rifle that was viable at all ranges, beating or going even with the full auto rifle in all situations except maybe close mid range and in situations where you wanted the spray. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now the burst is in a bad spot. I deliberately picked it up various times to get a feeling for it. But I just don't feel it.

\-Long range, first shot accuracy kicks in more slowly compared to the full auto, and even then it is unlikely to hit more than one bullet of the burst, making it the vastly inferior choice, especially compared to a silenced scar.

\-Close range, the meta nowadays favors SMGs as higher DPS weapons and follow up weapons. The burst does reward exceptional aim, however, an unpredictable jump by an opponent means your burst misses and you probably lose significantly to an eventual full auto gun. (You obviously should lose to smgs)

\-Long midrange is the same as long range, FSA takes too long to kick in and recover. You can easily fire three FSA bullets from a full auto rifle before you'd even get to your second burst and as said previously, it is unlikely to hit more than one bullet per burst

\-Close midrange is the range where I'd argue bursts are good if you are in the right position. This is the range where you consistently hit 2 bullets with your burst, aswell as being out of smg range. Quickly peeking without FSA to get a burst of in fact rewards you with good burstdamage and gives an opponent no window to react. However, a full auto rifle can deliver serious damage on this range aswell, so it is not much worse.

\-However, this one strength I can identify on close midrange comes with the downside of not being able to spray with your rifle, effectively weakening your ability to take out structures beyond smg range significantly. The burst AR just feels super hit or miss, and it is hard to justify taking it over the consistency and flexibility of a full auto AR.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I think the burst rifle could either use a new niche or a straight up buff. Some buffs that could be applied are either:

\+Solidify it's niche as a close midrange gun by giving it better moving accuracy, allowing you to quickly peek and get a burst of. This would not affect long range as on the long ranges you need to wait for FSA to be reliant with your shots therefore you can't move.

\+Buff its structure damage so it is on par with the full auto in taking out structures.

\+Slightly buff the firerate of the bursts

\+Slightly buff the damage

\+Make it so the time it takes to get FSA is synchronized with the fire rate, meaning that if you shoot at your max fire rate while standing still, you'll have FSA for each burst. This would buff the gun in longer ranges, while keeping it roughly the same for close midrange (as you can rarely afford to not move at those ranges).

&amp;#x200B;

Again these are just some suggestion that come to my mind but I do think the burst rifles could use some love, especially considering the lower grades being really bad right now. ",FortniteCompetitive

But it's undeniably overpowered for turtling.  I think there are some elegant solutions to limit turbo buildings strength without losing its quality of life.   

For me the simple solution is just limiting the amount of times a certain piece can be placed in a spot within some time frame.  Something like you can't place the same build more than 5 times in 2 seconds.  This essentially prevents turtling in one box and promotes editing, building multiple boxes, re-positioning, etc.  Things that actually require a modicum of skill.  It would not have any impact on ramping, 90s, pyramid strats, etc.

Over the past weeks we have been hearing what you've had to say about the subreddit itself and the moderation going on here. We've gone through users posts, comments, private messages, modmails and meta posts that have suggestions for us to implement for a better experience.  I know that there is a few of us moderators right now doing what we can do to keep this sub running pretty well, but it might just not be enough and I understand that, I do personally take this to heart as I am passionate about this community and Fortnite. We do want to give you the best experience in this sub as we possibly can. We have noticed a lot of community dissatisfaction with our current rules/moderation. The team took a few weeks to review what can be changed and new things we can try out here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Below we’ll outline the new and updated rules changes:

---

#User Specific Content


We know that you may need help deciding what settings are best for you to use; however, many times these posts are unique for the user and may flood the subreddit and drown out meaningful discussion. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Keybinds
- Resolutions
- Sensitivity
- Peripherals 
- Discord Scrim servers (Please refer to sidebar server links) 

   - [NA Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/C89qHyt)

   - [EU Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/vnQ7wSv)

   - [Console Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/DekWXnu)

&amp;nbsp;

Instead we will be making a weekly Settings Megathread for these types of questions. The threads will be sorted by new so you can get your discussion in and have other users help you out in regards to any setting questions you may have, this will help reduce clutter and have everything in one thread weekly!

---

#Constructive Player Posts

With a competitive subreddit there will always be talk about the pro-players/streamers. While we do not discourage posting about them, we will not allow posts just bashing on a player, team, organization, or streamer. These people are welcomed here as much as anyone else is. If you would like to create a post about them, make sure you meet the requirements listed:

* Constructive criticism
* Room for discussion
* Text post longer than xx words
* Non-frequently discussed player
* Be Mature and Considerate

&amp;nbsp;

This is to help reduce and remove any posts that are out to just bash on a player, I'm sure you have seen these post as much as we have and we are just looking to reduce these types of posts that can also clutter up the sub with little to no room for discussion. 

---

#Be Mature and Considerate

We want /r/FortniteCompetitive to be a friendly and welcoming community. Fortnite is a game that attracts people from all ages and all backgrounds, as a result it’s important that our users behave in a mature manner at all times.

This subreddit is Platform Neutral. Insults, personal attacks, condescension, or similar behavior relating to the merits of platform choice will not be tolerated. This is a bannable offense. Players of all platforms are welcome here, bullying is not.

&amp;nbsp;

This will be kept the same, remember to be considerate we're all a family community here! 

---

#Non-Competitive or Low Quality Content 

Sometimes Non-Competitive and low-effort content can flood the subreddit and drown out meaningful discussion. We want posts to mainly be about the competitive side of Fortnite. Please [use the search bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) before posting a question. In order to reduce the amount of excessive/redundant questions posted, questions that are deemed to have a projection of low participation and/or have easily obtainable answers will be removed. As such, it is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Posts not related to competitive mode / Fortnite esports
- Non-constructive opinions / complaints / rants
- Screenshots / Image Macros / Gifs
- General gameplay videos (unless allowed as per rule #7)
- Short/vague/general questions should go in our Weekly Questions/Discussions Megathread
- Game suggestions should be posted in the main subreddit /r/FortNiteBR. In-depth game suggestions that haven't been said before and are backed up by objective data/evidence will be allowed at a moderator's discretion
- Threads about the subreddit which should be sent directly to the mod team (i.e. Don't create a thread about why a previous thread was removed, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%20FortniteCompetitive) instead)

&amp;nbsp;

Slight change in wording with this one, we want to make sure that most of the posts on this sub is of quality and of the competitive nature in order to help out those seeking competitive info or the newest strats available. We do want to introduce more weekly discussion threads to minimize clutter in the sub and frequently posted topics.

---

#Post Tournament Discussion

After a huge tournament has ended we notice an abundant of posts being created. We know you’d like to get your discussion out there, but posts about big tournaments are reserved to the Live/Info and Post Match Megathreads all others despite being first will be removed. Do not:

- Do not reveal the winner of a match in a post title within 24 hours of the match ending.
- This includes posting a team has won an event, posting match scores, or congratulating a team or player for their win.
- Posting highlights from a match isn't a spoiler as long as the title doesn't reveal who won the map. ""Myth with the 3 health clutch"" is fine. ""Myth’s last kill to win the tournament with 3 health"" is not.
- Additionally, please mark your post as a spoiler using Reddit's spoiler tagging system.

&amp;nbsp;

To go alone with this rule, we think it would be okay to be a bit lenient when it comes to big tournaments such as Epic's Skirmishes, this means that posting clips of the tournament, while being general gameplay, is okay and information that pertains to the tourney, but only on the day of the tournaments. 

---

#Post Flairs

- Data - Posts with graphs, maps, etc
- Opinion - Posts that discuss who is the best or what a pro needs to change [This is 50% of the reddit of lately]
- Discussion - Posts talking about nerfs, buffs, game changes, etc
- Highlight - Clip videos
- Rumor - Misinformation or bad title posts [50% of the reddit]
- Strat - Videos, posts, or such that relate to improvement
- Console - For console plebs, there are a ton of these visiting the reddit.
- Pro News (or Pro Scene) - ""Tfue just got 14 kills in a scrim match"" ""Myth and vivid...""

---

#User Flairs - Soon

---

#Mod Applications

All moderators are unpaid, unaffiliated with Epic and expected to maintain professional attitudes. These applications will be open for a few weeks.

Please do not contact us in modmail regarding status updates or if you were or were not selected. You will be privately contacted if you are selected.

#[Apply here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_3yFbEiSaqwoPv_zExvlIUMMf7V9X3B2jmKymDg7Xs-dQ3A/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Important take away from this post

###Weekly threads

- Strat weekly threads | Weekly thread to throw in or discuss any starts that might be redundant or frequently posted (such as help with 90 degree, best ways to improve my builds etc)

- Settings weekly threads | Discussion for anything personal settings related, such as keybinds, resolutions, sensitivity etc.

- Scrim weekly threads | A place to throw in discord links for scrims that you want to share. I've seen a lot of clutter with scrim posts directing to a users discord and hopefully with this we can reduce and allow them.

Sorry I like evidence to support this, but a scroll through the fortnite twitter should verify. 

There was a week there was a shopping cart/atk challenge. They were removed from the game “due to a bug”, removed mid week, then that weekend was a skirmish, added back after the weekend. 

A couple weeks ago

“The port-a-fortress is removed due to a bug” then a few days later is another weekend fall skirmish. “
Then it’s added back. 

More recently (perhaps more serious bugs with this, never saw the rumored bugs in a video)

“Shadow stones removed due to bug” then following weekend is a skirmish. Follow week days, shadow stones are active again. 

Does epic remove unique items from the whole game to make the weekend skirmish a more standard version?

I heard that the shadow stone could get you inside a closed semi truck. Don’t see the big deal, you can still phase into the silos at anarchy. Also heard you could throw a nade, use stone, knock yourself, get revived and be permanently shadow stone and use weapons, but couldn’t build. I never saw evidence of these.

Ping really is everything in this game, even more so for us console players. I consider myself highly skilled, and I’m not going to say ping is holding me back, but at the sane time it is. There’s some builds that are literally impossible unless you’re on a low ping. Ultra fast double 90s aren’t possible on console with my ping (60-80). Double ramp/floor/wall is also really hard to pull off. If you play on super low ping, building is literally a joke. Nothing more annoying than getting matched against dudes living next to servers getting 9 ping.

Epic really needs to expand there servers, and although in fortunate enough to not have to live in even worse areas of the world for servers, it’s still annoying, and with how much money Epic has, and how much they try to convince us they care about the competitive side of the game, we need more servers. It’s just not fun going against other good players who can build anything and everything with ease because they’re getting 9 ping, while I’m over here getting 80 ping clipping threw shit and the game isn’t keeping up with how fast I place stuff down so it either doesn’t place it or places it super late.

This is a bit of a rant, but every time I see people do insane edit plays and insane ramp pushes and 90s I just can’t help but think damn, it must be nice to have 9 ping",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

1. Start fortnite and set graphics to 1920x1080 and full screen mode (if you already play stretched windowed you have to remove read only in GameUserSettings beforehand)
2. Create your custom resolution in Nvidia settings
3. Go to Nvidia settings - adjust desktop size and position - and set it to full-screen -Set preview resolution to your desired stretched resolution (for me it looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/8gPfT0l](https://imgur.com/a/8gPfT0l))
4. Set desktop resolution to 1920x1080
5. Go to AppData\\Local\\FortniteGame\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsClient -&gt; GameUserSettings and replace all 1920x1080 with your desired resolution
6. Save the file and right click on GameUserSettings -&gt; properties and set it to read only
7. Start fortnite, open task manager, right click on fortnite -&gt; properties -&gt; compatibility and enable "" disable full screen optimizations""
8. Restart the game and enjoy

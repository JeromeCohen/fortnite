If they did bring it back, they would have to nerf the damage of shot guns as a whole because of the ridiculous amounts of damage double pump use to do.

All I noticed is that people were getting in build fights using 200+ mats 5 minutes into a game. All night. That’s all I can remember. I don’t drop uncontested towns like Junk or Wailing, I like Salty, Retail, PP, TT. Even when we got uncontested Drops we would make it out and just get not stop pushed or perfectly flanked or some random event that usually renders either my teammate, myself, or both of us useless.

The mythical rarity is an idea to introduce weapons/items to Battle Royale with only ONE possible spawn of a weapon and item per match.

These weapons/items are meant to be potentially match altering but not necessarily overpowering as the mythical rarity implies. 

By match altering, I mean that some weapons/items may potentially have the ability to alter the map or create new but temporary dynamic only for the match.

There could be different cycles of mythical weapons/items potentially spawning each match to stir things up.

Some weapons could have overpowering damage output but will be known as the ""one shot"" weapons. 

An example of a mythical weapon could be the Zapotron. It was talked about back in Season 2 and people deemed it mythical before learning it was quickly removed. I know it is legendary rarity in STW but in BR it could mythical rarity in BR and altered accordingly. 

An example of a mythical item that alters the map could be on the level of when we saw meteors crash from the sky, or when we seen the rocket launch, and even Kevin doing his thing; But would only temporarily happen during a match. 

Heck, there could be an item that puts you in a spaceship and launches you across the map. 

The possibilities are endless and I for one think it would be interesting to dabble into this idea.

Got some inside news, the cube is gonna fall into the water at the south west side of the map creating a new biome area and traveling back in time, (No specifics on what the new area will be, just that it's a new biome and from a different time period.)

Also a no gravity LTM that's said to come pretty soon, featuring the whole map with that purple no/low gravity zone that is next to fatal fields.

A new item for the trap tab in BR only, No specifics sadly other then it'll be a place-able item. (hopefully not a damaging item, fingers crossed)

That's all, no other information.

Hey everyone my name is Mack and I go by the ign checkout\_mdm88tv and twitchmdm88.  

On Wednesday Night I was playing duo Scrims with my teammate to warm up for the upcoming duo season in FNPL. We placed second in two and first in another, after one of the scrim games I noticed that I was getting spam pinged in discord chat by ""Blake"" along with getting dms from him. The conversation can be found here [https://imgur.com/a/O3EuIK7](https://imgur.com/a/O3EuIK7) . About 10-15 mins later during a scrim game I noticed I had been banned from the FNPL server without any dms from a mod or even messages in the chat allowing me to defend myself. 

The accusation video can be found here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwITQ6fNQNA&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwITQ6fNQNA&amp;feature=youtu.be)

And my response can be found here [https://streamable.com/jq0bg](https://streamable.com/jq0bg)

My teammate wanted me to point out that during the kill on Blake my teammate also tagged him once. The guy in the tower was pretty obvious. In a scrim game when you see a pyramid or a ramp in a tower/ building late game, there’s no reason for a structure to be inside of them other than to hide. I'm also a west coast player playing on east coast servers which might be why Blake thought he was behind a wall on his screen but clearly above it on mine. 

Since I had no access to mods or the server owner since I was banned from the server my teammate has tried multiple times to contact admins, but has been ignored. I've also emailed the business email for FNPL which I know is unprofessional but I have literally no other method of reaching out.

I'm hoping by posting here it can get enough traction to not only get my ban overturned but also change the judiciary system not only in FNPL but other competitive leagues for Fortnite. 

A little bit of my play history for context includes: 10 years of competitive counter-strike including beating Team3d in CS1.6 which can be found here [https://play.esea.net/match/1064915](https://play.esea.net/match/1064915) (they went by dunder mifflin because they were coming back from CS:Source but the roster is the same). Top 500 in Overwatch [https://imgur.com/a/fp7tXQ8](https://imgur.com/a/fp7tXQ8) , Top 10 Squads in PUBG with a current Overwatch pro [https://imgur.com/a/Z1rab8r](https://imgur.com/a/Z1rab8r) , and  Diamond one  in LoL [https://imgur.com/a/11Qgix3](https://imgur.com/a/11Qgix3) (FNPL Status) [http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/349948/Jungle88Jungle](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/349948/Jungle88Jungle) (Hit the arrow at the top of the page next to s6/7). The only reason I bring this up is to show how long I’ve been playing games and how competitive I am. 

A brief explanation of Epics Anticheat software is  that its a multi-pronged system that uses intrusive anticheat software. Very little gets through it, and its updated constantly.   
If you want to learn about Epics Anticheat you can find info here [https://www.kamu.gg/services/security](https://www.kamu.gg/services/security)

As I’ve stated I just want the issue to be resolved, I don't want a witch hunt against the accuser because people rage all the time but rather an overturn on my ban and a change in the judiciary system. Sorry for the long read but I want my name cleared and I appreciate any help I can get. ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Playground is a mode to have fun with friends creating amazing mini games that no one has ever seen before but at the same time it's not possible. Getting mats is super duper easy,  it doesn't even take 1 minute to get max wood **while** bouncers on the other hand takes years to get. Idk about you guys but from my perspective i usually get 6-9 bouncers in 10-15 minutes. I want playground to be more fun and not hunting for llamas type of mode.

What im thinking is you guys could add **playground V3** :

**Unlimited bouncers/traps/launchpads/campfires**

**Unlimited ammo**

Timing : 1 hour.

I feel like 1 hour is a perfect amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys disagree then please let me know why because i find no reason to disagree on this.

I came across some highlight videos and a showcase of all the emotes on YouTube and thought they all looked cool. I especially liked the ones that reference real life dances. So I logged in for the first time and played a few games. Then I remembered about the emotes I saw in the video and decided to find out how you got them as I was super excited to be able to do the worm because that one was my favourite out of the ones I saw. I was crushed when I found out that it was a limited time item and I would never be able to do it in-game. After that I decided to find out what else I missed out on, and then I saw it. The odious scourge of wailing woods. I instantly fell in love. It was byfar the coolest skin I've ever seen In a video game. I was so upset I had missed out. Then a long time passed where I just accepted the fact that I missed out and wouldn't get anything from past seasons and I just forgot about it UNTIL I browsed this sub yesterday and saw that post about kevin (the absolute unit) climbing the wall. In that clip the player activates the worm, my favourite dance, and I instantly have flashbacks to when I first started playing and all the stuff I missed out on. It haunts me every day that as long as epic sticks to their guns (which I can respect them for) I will never have anything from what, in my opinion, was the best battle pass. So there is my little rant and a half about missing out. Tl;dr limited time items suck and this game is stupid (just kidding.) The REAL Tl;dr is let the og's have their og items I'm just salty I missed out (who knows maybe they will come back years later.) P.S. I logged in today and saw the pure salt emote in the shop. You just gotta rub it in don't you epic.

129,HallowCorpsGaming,1535759324,9bymfa,53,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9bymfa/idea_for_venom_ltm/,105,Idea for Venom LTM,"	I’m going to start this by saying that this LTM will probably never happen.  Since Venom is mostly likely to be R-rated, I doubt Epic will do crossover with an R-rated and probably violent movie.  That is unless Sony actually makes Venom PG-13, then maybe, and that’s a BIG maybe, they might do a crossover LTM.  I also want to say that a few things will be similar to the Infinity Gauntlet LTM. I’m providing a link to the latest trailer as I will be using it as a reference for some characters abilities.  There will be some spoilers in the post for the new Venom, but nothing too spoilery.
Venom Trailer (does have spoilers, watch at own risk): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLCn88bfW1o
	The match would start off similar to Infinity Gauntlet LTM, where before the first zone is revealed, the Symbiotes will fall from the sky and land somewhere on the map.  And yes, there will be multiple Symbiotes that land instead of one like the Infinity Gauntlet mode.  That way this LTM can be for Duos and Squads, and not just Solos.  As probably most of you will know, in the comic books there are multiple different Symbiotes.  There’s, of course the Venom Symbiote, there’s Carnage, Toxin, Anti-Venom, Hybrid, and the Life Foundation Symbiotes, Riot, Scream, Phage, Lasher, and Agony.  Now since Riz Ahmed’s character was confirmed to *in Spoiler Text* Riot, and Michelle Lee will *in Spoiler Text* Donna Diego AKA Scream, we will use Venom and the other Life Foundation Symbiotes.  Here’s how Symbiotes will work in this mode.  Once you get a Symbiote, it will take up three out of the five usable slots in your inventory.  The aim of this is to only allow you carry either two weapons, two heath and shield items, or one of each.  When you obtain Symbiote, you would go through and animation where the Symbiote take over you, similar to how obtaining the Infinity Gauntlet would do an animation and send you into the sky, so you glide somewhere else. Of course when that animation is occurring you will be invulnerable.  Then you would either teleport to a random point on the map, where you transform back into your normal character with three of your inventory slots taken up by the Symbiote. 

	Each Symbiote will have its own unique abilities. Each Symbiote will have three abilities, and one consumable or ability that can only be used a limited amount of times. The first ability will always be some kind of slash ability, but each Symbiote will do it with different speeds and damage.
Let’s start with Venom. Venom is more mid-tier. He’s not the faster, but not the slowest, but does pretty good damage:
Health: 800
Shield: 200
First Ability: Slash Attack; does 95 damage, fifth fastest slash.
Second Ability: Tendril Smash; A three tile long tendril shoots out from Venom’s arm smashing to the ground casing area damage. Players who get hit, take 110 damage. Has a .75 second cool-down.
Third Ability: Venomous Bite; Venom shoots out another tendril that can grab a person and bring them to Venom. Venom will bite the target and deal 120 damage. If you survive this, you will be poisoned and dealt 2 damage over five seconds. Has a 4.5 second cool down, it’s to be more of an ultimate move. 
Consumable: Offspring Detection; Venom can detect the general direction of the other five Symbiotes. Can only be used three times per user. 
Riot will be next. He doesn’t damage as much damage as Venom, nor is he as tanky, however he is quite fast. Now in the comics Riot preferred to use more blunt weapons, like giant hammers or maces. In comics Phage was the one who used bladed weapons. However the latest trailer showed Riot using more axe or scythe like weapons.  Since this will be based off of the movie, I am going to switch these around and give Phage blunt weapons and have Riot use sharp weapons. 
Health: 700
Shield: 200
First Ability: Slash; Second fastest slash, only deals 75 damage. 
Second Ability: Scythe Slash; Forms the two giant scythe like weapons that were seen in the trailer (Timecode: 2:14) doing wider area damage but only do 100 damage if a player gets hit.  Has a .4 second cool down. 
Third Ability: Scythe Dash; Riot forms the giant scythes and does three dashes, swinging one with each dash. Each swing does 80 damage, and each dash covers two tiles. If you dash into a player, the player will knocked forward, similar to how the ATK will deal knockback when you run into someone. That way you can hit the player with each dash. Has a 3 second cooldown.
Consumable. Symbiote Glaive; Riot throws a large Symbiote glaive (like the one Wesley Snipes uses in the nightclub scene in Blade). Has a fifteen tile range, can break all materials and does 50 damage. Can only be use 5 times. 
Next up is Scream. A little bit slower than Riot, but has a lot more range, and has a higher DPS:
Health: 600
Shield: 300
First Ability: Slash, deals 80 damage, third fastest slash.
Second Ability: Bladed Dash; Scream forms a knife, and dashes forward, dealing 95 damage to anyone in her path. Has a three tile range. Has .3 second cooldown.
Third Ability: Symbiote Hair Spikes; Scream crouches and shots out her hair in the form of the spikes (as seen in the latest trailer at 2:10) all directions in a dome shape. Deals 140 damage, has 2.25 second cool down.
Consumable: Symbiote Hair Trap; Scream can throw a trap on the ground. If a player walks over it, it will trap the player for five seconds, dealing 5 damage per second. You start out with three. One of the two consumable that can be replenished, but only once all three traps and used and activated. 
The fourth Symbiote will be Lasher. While Lasher is faster than Venom it’s not by much. Has great range, deals good damage:
Health: 700
Shield: 300
First Ability: Tendril Slash; Lasher uses his tendrils to slash at his opponents. Deals 85 damage, fourth fastest slash. 
Second Ability: Tendril Jab; Lasher shoots all of his tendrils forward, continuously stabbing at his enemy. Paralyzes player and deals 120 damage if all of his tendrils hit. Has a .5 second cooldown.
Third Ability: Tendril Spin; Lasher sends his tendrils out in a circle around and spins, moving forward. Think Garen’s Judgement ability in League of Legends. If a player is hit initially when the spinning starts, they will dealt 150 damage. Has a 3.5 second cooldown.
Consumable: Tendril ball; Lasher throws out a Symbiote ball. When it lands, 5 tendrils shoot out and slash the area around them twice. Each tendril slash deals 12 damage.
	Next up is Agony. Agony is the fastest of all the Symbiotes, with the highest DPS as well. But she has the least amount of health:
Health: 400
Shield: 400
First Ability: Slash; Deals 70 damage, is the fastest slash of all Symbiotes.
Second Ability: Acidic Claws; Agony will fill her claws with acid and slashes three times. Each slash deals 25 damage. Every slash will deal damage over time, 5 damage per second, with the length depending on how many slashes are landed. If only one slash is landed, the damage will last for 5 seconds. If two slashes are landed, the damage will last for 12 seconds. If all three slashes are landed, the damage will last for 20 seconds. Has a .2 second cooldown 
Third Ability: Acidic Stream; Agony spay acid over large area. When it hits the ground, it will deal 5 damage every half second (like the Stink Bombs) for ten seconds. If it hits a player directly, it will stick to the player, and deal 10 damage every half second for 5 seconds. Damage does not stack. If the player is hit directly by the acid, they will not be dealt the floor damage. If the player is not hit directly by the acid and walks onto the affected area, the player will only be dealt the floor damage. Has a 2 second cooldown
Consumable: Acid Bomb; Agony throws a ball of acid, that is basically the stick, but lasts only for three seconds. The second of the two consumables that can be replenished. All four most be used, before they can start being replenished. One minute after the first four are used, three more Acid bombs will be available, with the limit being changed to three.	
	And the last Symbiote, is Phage. Phage is slowest out of all the Symbiotes and is tank. Deals great damage but has a high cooldown:
Health: 800
Shield: 400
First Ability: Punch; Deals 100 damages, is the slowest out of all the Symbiotes. 
Second Ability: Bludgeoning Mace; Page forms a large mace and smashes the ground, causing a large rupture that knocks enemies back, and conforms to the terrain. Basically it’s the new Seismic Impact ability that the Ragnarok hero has in Save the World. Deals 150 damage, and has a two tile range. Has a 1 second cooldown.
Third Ability: Hammer Shockwave; Phages forms a giant hammer with both hand, leaps into the air and smashes the ground. Very similar to Thanos’ smash except over a much wider area. Deals 175 damage, and destroys all buildings within a four tile radius. Has a 5 second cooldown.
Consumable: Throws a harden Symbiote ball that deals 60 damage, provides knockback, and destroys all buildings in its path. Hits players in a 1x1 area, and hits building in a 3x3 area, ensuring it can knock down a 1x1 tower. Has a 9 tile range. 

	Now, here’s how the game goes after you gain a Symbiote. When you are not transformed into a Symbiote, you will not be seen on the map. However, when you are transformed, you will be seen on the map by all players. In the comics, Symbiotes are bullet proof. In this LTM, when transformed, damage against Symbiotes will be reduced. For example, a Golden Scar normally deals 36 damage. Against a transformed Symbiote, it will only deal 28 damage. Same thing happen to players who have a Symbiote, but aren’t transformed. A Golden Scar would 32 damage to player who has a Symbiote, rather than 36. Symbiotes weakness in the comics is fire, so explosive weapons like the Rocket Launcher will deal extra damage to Symbiotes. For example a Golden Rocket Launcher normally deals 121 damage, but will deal maybe 150 damage to transformed Symbiote, and 131 damage to non-transformed Symbiotes. Instead of a 2% drop rate, the Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, and Guided Missile Launcher, will instead have a 10% or 12% drop rate. A Symbiote can only heal when they are not transformed. Also Symbiotes will be faster than an average player.
	I haven’t exactly decided how using a Symbiote will work. One option is In Squads only two players in one squad can be Symbiotes, and in Duos, both players can be Symbiotes. If you are downed when transformed, you will revert back to normal, and it will be exactly the same as when you are normally downed. This, of course, only applies to Duos and Squads. When you die, there will be an animation the Symbiote leaves the body. I also think it would be cool if you could use the emote wheel and play different lines of dialogue for each Symbiote. Like the “Eyes, lungs, pancreas. So many snacks, so little time” Line from the trailer. 
	Let me know what you all think of my Venom LTM. If you have any suggestions or changes that you can think of, let me know.  If this one gets well received, I may do more crossover LTMs. Next one would probably be Ghost Rider.

Every win you get, you receive 1x victory royale token. These tokens can be spent at the token shop for cosmetics that are in the shop for the entirety of the season and are exclusive to that season. The costs ranges from 5-10-25-50-100 victory royale tokens. This gives some incentive to actually win and an alternative way to get skins that are more skill based.

As you probably know, Fortnite has had a major shift in the meta of close range combat, with SMGs replacing the shotguns as the dominant weapon in that field. However, I feel  like there has been a certain group of weapons that the Fortnite developement team has forgotten about, and that´s pistols.

Pistols, in their current state, aren´t very good at all. Their spread is too big to be used in close range, their firing rates and clip size is too bad to keep up in mid to long range combat and overall, players tend to avoid these weapons late game.  It is still possible to use them effectively, but these moments come up rarely. I personally am one of the people that try to make these weapons work, but it´s much more difficult than say, picking up a shotgun or an SMG.

However, there´s one type of pistol that has been standing out of the weapon group, and that´s dual pistols. This weapon has a consistent spread, consistent firing rate that doesn´t have to be achieved manually and it has very consistent damage. This is the ideal pistol. My question then is, why not make the other pistols more like the dual pistols?

Why not make the Deagle have a much tighter spread (including first shot accuracy when aiming down sights), and a tiny bit faster firing rate? Why not make another single fire, skill based weapon to compete with the spray and pray SMG meta that we have today? And the same of course goes for the (unfortunately soon to be vaulted) revolver and the normal and silenced pistols. Normal pistols should probably have a larger spread, but they should be able to get the same treatment nonetheless.

I hope that my post explains my thoughts and opens up a discussion to be had, I have more ideas that I personally think should be implemented to the game (such as boosted wood farming, shotgun changes and making all weapons in the game projectile based), but this was mainly focused on the current state of pistols.

I can play so many more games but none of them were as fun as pre season 4 fortnite. Before it was a primarily a skill based shooter. Now its based around luck. I probably will get downvoted, but im voicing my opinion. The games community is toxic and childish, and im getting sick of everyone thinking fortnite is the only game that exists. I hope soon this game doesnt die, but just decreases in player base.  I truly and sick of people blabbing on about fortnite.

tl;dr The game is boring once you get good, the community is too big and toxic, im getting annoyed of non-stop fortnite.

The next day, I woke up and saw that my Galaxy skin arrived, I contacted my friends and asked if they got their skins as well, they haven't. 48 hours later, they still haven't received their galaxy skins.

I have ~60 wins, but a terrible K/D (barely over 1.0 because I was terrible until like Season 3/4), my highest kill game is 11, and I am decent at building (and know the areas I need to improve, and am practicing in Playground).

The one thing I really struggle with is aiming in close-range combat with Shotguns and, to a lesser extent, SMGs (I try to avoid them because I’m not a fan of the meta at all, but I’m not good enough at aiming with shotguns to ditch them entirely). I am just wondering what exercises I should do, settings I should change, or things I should do differently.

I have clips uploaded on this Reddit account that you can check out that you can check out if you’d like to, and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMOgRfpoQnDkAlizuTIqPqg) where I post clips as well (I’m not trying to self-promote, my YouTube channel is unbranded and the videos are just raw mp4 files, I just use it to show friends, there is no ads either.)

I submitted this as a text post so I could throw some of my thoughts down as well because I'd like this to be more than just a video from some random person on the internet. (Maybe some of you are in the same boat and may find some light through this post)  


First off, thank you to anyone who gave time to click on this post, watch the video, and will read what I have to say (I will keep it brief). I'm mainly posting this on the Fortnite reddit because I love this community and it's a game that has consumed the past few months of my life so heavily.  


I've been in a unpleasantly dark place for nearly two years now, but I'm a firm believer that life will always get better. I went from the highest point in my life -- working a full-time job, being a full-time college student, gym 6+ times a week, running 3 to 30+ mile Spartan Races (crazy terrain &amp; obstacle running races) to absolutely nothing. Due to multiple bodily injuries and chronic depression kicking it in overdrive, I find myself waking up everyday without much purpose. To keep things short as to why I haven't gotten much sorted out... anxiety ain't no joke. Although I'm at the lowest I've ever been in life (and it makes me feel undoubtedly awful know that), I still believe that life WILL get better.  


To cope with everything, I've been trying to stream more frequently as a means to socially interact and calm myself. When I'm not streaming and playing, I typically get more upset (at myself) so streaming definitely mellows me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone who is feeling down, just know that you're not alone. If anyone just wants to talk and discuss things, I'm here.   


Thank you all, keep marching on. &lt;3 ",FortNiteBR

Hear me out for a second - What if you landed with 100 mats and every time you kill someone you get mats for killing them (not dropped on the ground just instantly added to your mats pool) that way it would eliminate the sometimes boring and tedious job of farming mats for too long.

I think the game should focus more on killing people than farming tons and tons of mats every single game and being a build lord in every battle. This way mats would be harder to come by and promote actual fights to earn your mats.

249,Llunvi,1535738039,9bvtei,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9bvtei/fortnite_cube_prediction/,26,Fortnite Cube - Prediction,"1-2 Days ago the cube was stuck and could not move. Everyone thought the cube was going to hit Salty but no. The cube activated a Zero Gravity dome. Currently everyone thinks the cube is going to hit tilted towers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what we know, the cube moves every 1 hour and 30 minutes most days, in the files it says the words lake. Although everyone thinks this resolves to loot lake there are multiple different lakes. The cube is set to make 7 runes before the end of season 5.

&amp;#x200B;

In the files of the game something called the mega storm is lurking around in there. What could this mean you ask? Well since season 3 all seasons have ended the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually some place is destroyed, like the meteor hit Dusty and it is now Dusty Divot. And the rocket launch made a rift in the sky which took out a lot of places in the game, and Moisty Mire was destroyed and turned into Paradise Palms.

&amp;#x200B;

So no matter what we know that someplace in the game is going to get hit by this so called Mega Storm. Now here is why I think Tilted Towers is not going to be hit from the huge storm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tilted Towers was hit last season with the meteor. That place is currently getting rebuilt by fortnite. Now I want you to think about why they would be repairing the building in Tilted Towers if its just going to get destroyed? Whats the point in all the coding?

&amp;#x200B;

Now we all know how when the cube was in Anti Gravity mode little rocks were floating up right next to the cube. Although there are many lakes, the cube might for sure hit loot lake. If the cube where to have 7 runes most of the runes are from Anti Gravity. If the cube had a Anti Gravity moment in loot lake water would be rising from the ground like the rock did from the cube.

&amp;#x200B;

If water rises from the cube it can very much make a Mega Storm in fortnite. Now lightning comes out of the cube making this a mega storm formed with water and lightning. Although the cube looks like its heading to Tilted Towers, if it did hit Tilted how will a water storm be created? Well it can't there is no water in Tilted. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this Mega Storm was formed in Loot Lake then wouldn't it destroy loot lake? Not a lot of people have been liking loot lake for a while now. Maybe epic has finally decided to get rid of it? Although if a Mega Storm hits loot lake than that's the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that might still be standing is the factory's which I doubt. Usually storms travel along different places. Loot Lake is right next to Tilted Towers so Tilted could be destroyed. But Loot Lake might be destroyed as well. Now I have some more info for you all.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the Medieval season 2 we were introduced to the Fort-knight skins. There descriptions read a place they were associated with for example Red Knight is Anarchy Achers. All of these places have been destroyed. Except one of them which is Wailing Woods for Black Knight.

&amp;#x200B;

If Wailing Woods were taken out all of there places would be taken out. Now we all know the cube is still moving but remember that leak of a Castle in the backround, no Viking Village, and no Villain Lair. The cube looks to be in a spot that is right next to that Castle that we saw as a leak. If wailing gets destroyed by this Mega Storm then that might mean the Castle will forge and start Season 6.

&amp;#x200B;

As the Castle will form when all the places of the Fort-Knights are destroyed.

This is all the Information I have and it is my assumptions.",FortNiteBR

1. **The spam**   Drum guns/lmg/any type of smg needs taken out of the game. In my opinion I think epic should go back to when there was tactical smg's and silenced smg's. 
2. **SMG's take little to no skill to use**    All you really need to do is hold your crosshair over another player and hold left click.
3. **Allow Pump + Tactical shotgun**   This was by far my most favorite meta. Why? Because it wasn't overpowered, and it took more skill to use than an smg. You would just shoot a pump, then switch to your tactical, which is by far better than the meta's current state. 
4. **The Drum Gun**     The drum gun can unload 9 shots in 1 second. That would mean that if you're holding a green drum gun, close range, and you hit every single shot. You would be doing 225 damage. The 50 round clip is insane, and in my opinion it's just a broken gun along with any other smg.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell everyone why I quit playing Fortnite.

I'm playing Fortnite even before BR came out.

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons:

\- Bugs / Glitches (Both PVE + BR)

\- SMG's, the most annoying gun to play against. It's so OP, shotguns no matters anymore.

\- Pump Shotgun doing 8 Damage to the head and 165 to the Leg.

\- The dev's doesn't care anymore about their players.

\- I know skins are not something that will help you win but, the prices are high af. 20$ for a outfit? (There is new skin every single day)

\- Every update they adding more stupid stuff that no one cares about like (Thank the driver), WTF?! why would they fix the real issues here causing player loss.

\- I don't even know if the Report system even works.

\- The D-Sync of this game is so trash like PUBG, sniper shot 1m above you will kill you.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope everyone understand my point of view. I really didn't want to quit Fortnite, cause I really like this game. But, if there is not going to be a well done updates, I will never come back to this game again.

and Yes, I bought every single skin from the start. And I don't give a shit about the skins, I will give all of my skins if they will bring back the double pump, and remove the SMG's.

The Galaxy Skin ONLY will be removed if the store manager reports the Phone and Tablets IMEI number to Samsung. Chances of this happening are 1/100, but could still happen, which means the skin could dissappear any day from your locker. 

NO, your fortnite account will not get banned.

You can't do it quickly and, at least for me, it hardly works till the 2nd try and by that time someone had already reloaded and is spamming your wall again. On ever control setting it needs to be fixed, in my opinion, to just tapping be instead of holding for 1 second which is a long time in the game of Fortnite and it's just a royal pain and it needs to be able to be as quick as PC. I know some people will try to build a wall while looking at another and it's end up editing but that's why you can also add a short range for editing so that you have to be only 1 square max away from it to edit it.

I think the big reason that double shotgun was used was because pellets actually had RNG. Epic admits that before the pellets had individual hit markers DMG was based on RNG. So now that each pellet has set damage how about bringing the damage back up. The reason we need shotgun damage restored is due to the fact that SMGs are causing people to go through mats like crazy. It has been like that all of season 5. It’s a very boring meta. So with shotguns at high DMG you will start to think twice about just running through ammo as someone that is building. If you don’t play smart you will get one pumped. I know it sounds bad but if you are going to play with 0 skill and have to waste all my mats on one player then you also deserve to have a way to combat spammers. I can shoot a spammer but now I’m 100% left open since he is putting bullets down range so fast. What is everyone thoughts? Input is appreciated.

TLDR: bring shotgun DMG back up with new delay since shotgun DMG is no longer RNG based. This will combat low skill spammers that waste all the mats in the game.",FortNiteBR

I have my keys rebound for my mouse to be easy to reach and have practiced enough to know what button to click when I need it. The issue I come into is placing my structure. 

For example, on PS4 with builder pro, I need stairs I hit L2 Twice. Once to select. Once to place. Then every L2 click after places stairs.

On PC I have to press my thumb button for stairs, then click LMB to place. If I want to switch to walls, I click that button then have to press LMB again. 

Can I set it so that my “place” is the same button click as selecting the piece? If so I haven’t figured this out

Or am I just slow?

It's been 49 hours but I haven't received my Galaxy skin so wanted to clarify something - when you loaded up the Fortnite app for the first time on the Note 9/Tab S4 what option did you use to login?  2 days ago I used the PS4 login option because I only play on PS4, however I noticed there is also an 'Epic Account' option to sign in.

DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES
The flamethrower would catch wooden structures on fire. Including some pre built houses and gas stations. The fire would spread slowly and break the wooden structures after a period of time. The flamethrower could also be used to destroy parts of forests because the fire would spread tree to tree. This would be useful at end games at dusty divot or whaling woods. Tall grass would also be burned. Large plumes of black smoke would be created to alert other players to your position. And structures exposed to smoke would be charred black.

DAMAGE TO PLAYERS 
If the flamethrower was pointed directly at a player the player would burst into flames and suffer damage for a set time depending on how long they were in the original stream of flame. Being inside of the flame would deal more ticks of damage. If the player was on fire they would also light flammable materials on fire or create burn marks on structures.

AMMO COLLECTION
Ammo would be collected from breaking gas tanks at gas stations, cars, gas tanks on trucks, and grills located around the map. Bigger objects would grant more ammo while smaller objects like grills would grant one or two.


Please leave any suggestions or tweaks in the comments. I would love to hear what you guys think of something like this.

The solid gold option largely gets rid of all of that. 

While I'm sure there are many people that enjoy the faster pace of the SG 50's and some people just like using the gold versions of weapons, I don't think it serves the audience that tends to play 50's overall -- which is a shame given that this LTM replaces the normal mode. 

I've really enjoyed the various 50's they've done up until now (with Soaring being the best without question), but this is leaving me very disappointed. ",FortNiteBR

Whats yours now?,"I got my Playstation when Season 2 was out. I had no other games besides CoD WW2 (bundled with my PS4) and Overwatch. I started downloading Fortnite (brother told me to get it). I huddled up in my favorite winter blanket, got on my gaming chair (had no chair legs, you rocked around on it on the floor) and listened to that menu music for a bit. Played some Solos and had fun. I sucked a lot, but it was fun. I died because I got outplayed. Playstation gifted me $10 in store credit (idk why) and I got battle pass. Blue Squire was my fav skin then.


Now, here is today...

Get in same chair and start game. I have lots of skins by now (maxed out all my battle passes). I start up Solo. Get SMGed sprayed and my buildings are paper. Rage. Start up Solo. Die because someone was exploiting the game. Start up Solo. Only have tac shotgun, and my shots are close, on the face, and 80% of the pellets hit. 14 damage. Guy murders me with SMG. Rage. Only play because I want the game to get better and I don't want to miss out on things. The new music is great, but the old music was better. ",FortNiteBR

So basically what I think is going to happen is this. The first rune was created at 5:52 PM EST, so if this were to repeat, then every 24 hours a new rune would appear until it gets to its final destination, Fatal Fields. Not exactly Fatal, but the lake in Fatal. The reasoning for this is that this lake is the closest to the cube and would make sense to travel there. The reason it moved West is to just mess with us. In one way or another it will turn around and head there. Fatal Fields has been in the game since day one, same as Dusty Depot, Moisty Mire,Tomato Town, and Anarchy Acres. All of those are GONE. What I think epic is doing is throughout the seasons Epic will wipe out every old location, Pleasant Park, Retail Row, Wailing Woods, Flush Factory, Greasy Grove. As we saw in the Capoeria emote on twitter. Behind the mountain is a Castle. Guess where that castle is. Pleasant Park. BOOM. BOO. BIZZLY BLAM.",FortNiteBR

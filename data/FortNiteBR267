They nerf shotties, add more smgs, and buff smgs. In season one and two shot guns were for the most part functional and smgs were used as an extra gun if you couldn't find a shotgun. Now, if its a pump/smg situation, the smg will win. That is not how this game should work, its not how any game works if you think about it. I say we bring back the ability to double pump, or just fix shotties damage. ",FortNiteBR

I say Epic makes Teammate Gear ( Weapons/Meds/Shields ) invisible to your teammates after you are Thirsted or you have bled out.  I think this would solve some of the Toxic behavior.

I've been thinking about fornite saying they want more viable game play styles than just whoever can build the best and it got me thinking about how they can actually do that given the current state of the game. They're going to need to implement some major changes to add a 'new meta' or at least a variety of metas. 

I've thought about a perk system for both 'health and shields' as well as 'material perks'. I've tried to make some for both players bases (the more casual and the more try hardy ones). The idea is, they're picked in the locker screen and you can only select one of each and just swap them round just like a skin. Let me know what you guys think.

**Material Perks**:

\- **Pacifist**: Halves your material cap to 500 wood, 500 brick and 500 metal

but provides a passive material gain of 3 wood/second,

2 brick/ second and 1 metal/ second. 

\- **Horder**: Increases material cap to 1500 wood, 1500 brick and 1500 metal.

\- **Efficient** Farmer: Blue farming hit markers are now twice as effective.

\- **The Houser**: All structures are placed at 100%/75%/50% (w/b/m) of their total

health pool but consume twice as much material.

\- **Hidden Gem**: When destroying non-player built structures there is a 10% chance to get a bonus 50 of the respective

material. 

\- **Uncomfortable grip**: You can hold right click to consume 1 point of health per second to increase your pickaxe swing

by 50%. 

\- **Refund**: After getting a kill you will recieve 50% of the material used in the last 30 seconds. 

\- **German Engineering**: All metal structures are immune to explosives but are 20% more vulnerable to all other damage.

\**Experimental idea*\* -** Futuris**t: You can no longer build brick or metal. Instead, you can build carbon fibre which is 

2 bricks and 1 metal. It is stronger than metal, regenerates faster than wood and looks cool! 

**Health and Shields Perk**:

\- **Positive Return**: When killing an enemy you will regenerate to 75 health and 50 shields over 10 seconds. 

\- **Die another Day**: All incoming damage is now split into 80% instant and 20% bleed (directly to health) 

over 5 seconds. 

\- **Enhanced Barriers**: When you have shields, all incoming damage is reduced to 90%. 

\- **Prep time**: Passively regain 1 health/ second and 1 shield/ second when out of combat for more than 15 seconds. 

\- **Herbalist**: Trees and bushes have a 10% chance of dropping a mushroom or apple when destroyed by your pickaxe. 

Mushrooms and Apples are now 2x as effective. 

\- **Ready for anything**: all medical supplies can now be stacked to 1.5x the original cap.

\- **Gotta catch the bus!** : All medical supplies are now consumed 25% faster. 

\- **Ready**: You start the game with 50 shields but only 75 health. 

\- **Adrenaline**: When below 50 health you recieve a 50% movement speed buff. 

\- **HULK**: You can never have shields but your health is increased to 250, bandages heal you to 200.

\- **Yin and Yang**: You regenerate 1 point of shield per 5 health gained and 1 point of health per 5 shield gained.

I don't know if this will be a popular idea but it could be the first change Epic need to make in order to add more diverse play styles. ",FortNiteBR

Here are some of my ideas for some of the skin classes but obviously you may not agree with all of them. Comment if you have any ideas for skins.

Bunnies: Jump boost (similar to hoprocks)

Snorkel/Water: Little to no slowdown in water

Disco: Regenerate health/shield while dancing

Skiiers: Take less fall damage

Dinosaurs: Doubles amount of health when in bushes

Bandolier: Infinite anmo for gray/green guns

Motorcycles: Buff with veichles (maybe faster or quieter)

Christmas: Start with presents (random weapon or consumable)

Halloween: Mini shields can heal up to 100

Bomber/Gunner: Explosives do more damage

Robbers: Everytime you hit someone you take some of their mats/ammo

Astronauts: Can fall faster and don't have to glide

Dazzle/Hyperion: Can sprint faster

Army skins (squad team, sub commander, etc...): Faster reload and more accurate

Venturions: Building requires less mats?

Some of these points are more divisive than others, and many seem to be shared by the majority of the community. I would welcome any productive discussion on these points.

**Definite changes**

1. Switch Stink Bomb and C4 rarities (if C4 stays as powerful as it is, should be a legendary or epic item)
2. Nerf damage radius from all explosives (one rocket should not completely destroy a 1x1)
3. Allow double shotguns but modify the mechanics (maybe a slight cool down similar to what we have now after you fire two different shotguns in a row)
4. Slight AR buff- either slightly less bloom or reduced damage fall-off

I truly believe this game would be in a better state if these changes were applied. This game has undergone a plethora of changes since I've been playing and is constantly evolving, and I think the current ""spam meta"", along with overpowered explosives, is stale and doesn't allow for a variety of play styles as Epic wants.",FortNiteBR

3. Stats

Switch can’t:

1. When in squad and duo mode you 
can‘t zoom out of the map (When spectating teamate).

2. When in squad mode you can not place your marker (when spectating teamate) The reason is beacause to place a marker you hit L, but to swap which teamate you are watching it is L also. If you click L is swaps your teamate, and does not place marker.

3. 60fps??

Xbox Can’t:

1. Zoom out of the map when spectating people in squad or duo. This is because the zoom out button is the same as the report button.

2. Can’t place markers while spectating squad teammates on Xbox when more than one person is alive. The button for placing markers is the same to change the player you spectate

I'm not here to ruffle any feathers or complain, I'm just going to state some things I think Epic could do to improve from the current spray/splode meta. First, I think that Epic should go the MW2 route and make everything OP so nothing is OP. This might seem stupid, but hear me out. Double shotgun in any form is completely gone. I think if Epic were to buff the shotguns back to their previous state, players would be much happier with the meta as they wouldn't be forced to run an SMG or Drum Gun along with their shotgun. I also think they should remove drop off damage on the Hand Cannon and Revolvers. These guns should reward players for being able to hit their targets, and currently they do not. Finally, I think explosives such as C4, RPG, and the GL should all recieve a nerf to some degree. Currently, these can all destroy some of the most intricate builds, and I think it would be more fair if somebody couldn't just shoot on rocket and take down a double ramp/floor/wall/ramp. I think this would balance the game as a whole as well as open up many more different and interesting metas than we currently have.

All these changes to do with building and changing the gun switching delays (such as the pump and tac etc) are so unnecessary. Somebody made a post once on Reddit stating that Epic's excuse towards that editing change and the gun delay was because of the 'new players need to stand a chance against good players' but then why can't Fortnite simply just add ranked matchmaking? This way the game won't be destroyed and if anything it will make the game a lot more competitive. Every update this game literally gets worse, because everything gets nerfed and it ruins the experience for players who've been playing since the early seasons of the game; seems to me that Epic only care about the new players at this point, not the old ones. 

That way new players won't moan about how 'OP' other players are (due to their skill etc) - Fortnite is literally about building, if you can't build good then the rate of you even winning a match is low as a high % of the players on Fortnite are pretty good at building. 6/10 fights you enter on Fortnite, it's a guaranteed build battle that's intense and that's facts. 

Sure, you have to look at the servers, how much it's gonna cost to run even more servers for specific ranking and such, but in the long term you will keep the concurrent player count rather than lose it due to terrible updates.

There's a ton of pros and cons with adding ranked matchmaking, but I don't see how this wouldn't be a good idea? This is a very successful game and it has been throughout the entire year even stated as the most addicting game, but I'm pretty sure Epic wouldn't want to lose it's #1 place on the list..

Scenario:
You're in a 1v1 with someone, they can't aim to save their lives and then they whip out a rocket, shoot at your feet, you die and they are down to minimal HP. It's their first kill of the game and all your work was for nothing.

Suggested Fix:
Rockets should need to travel a certain distance before exploding on impact or at least not do max damage. So if someone was to shoot you from 1cm away with a rocket, it would just collapse and not explode, whereas if you were 100m away, then it would do full max damage and explode on impact.

Wanted to include that before anything else but these are my thoughts based on the limited video of the new SMG that I've seen so far. The gun is already useless. So it has a faster fire rate but more bullet spread than the tactical SMG had. Well, the Drum Gun offers this too with less bullet spread, more bullet range and damage and larger clip. The drum gun is essentially a gold tactical smg that uses medium bullets. the new smg would never be used over a silenced smg due to a silence smg has the benefit of stealth, more accuracy and greater damage. The only time I could see someone using the new smg is in early game when you don't have a choice only to be dropped for a drum gun or a silenced smg as soon as possible. I get that the reason this gun was put into the game is that people were choosing smg's over AR's far too often because they are so viable now, but this gun is immediately outclassed by two existing guns. It has no purpose already. ",FortNiteBR

It's the only gun archetype without a legendary and it's all I want. I've always loved the smgs. Even before they were good.

But instead of getting that, this patch epic decides to not only make it the only gun archetype without a legendary variant, but also the only gun without an epic variant. And it makes literally no sense because the new any does the same damage as the tac if it was green, blue, purple. But because it's white, green, blue it does one less damage at the top end.

1. Undo shotgun nerfs - pump pullout, damage multipliers, keep double shotgun nerf, or alternatively revert double nerf and keep others. Not both.

3. Nerf c4

4. Possible alterations to accuracy on smgs/bloom OR remove bloom and add recoil

For example, the nerf on wall damage makes it impossible to break walls. The pullout delay on the pump makes no sense anymore as you can’t double pump and it can’t even do 200 damage anymore. Not to mention edit peeking is no longer OP as you can’t even see through walls when editing.

(Bring on the post apocolypse),"TLDR: The visitor has opened up a portal which has broke  the barriers of time and space, subsequently bringing in 'Ragnarok' or the apocalypse to the game. This will create exciting new game modes and an awesome new theme for season 6.

Hey guys and girls, I have a bit of a long one for you to read but hear me out. I have supplied evidence and sources for my theories, however this is all a theory, and might mean absolutely nothing. I also apologize for the format, this was all written on my phone.

So for those that don't know [Ragnarok](https://norse-mythology.org/tales/ragnarok/) is an important event in ancient Norse mythology, essentially foretelling the end of the current earth cycle and creation of a new cycle, essentially the apocalypse. (With a Phoenix effect at the end)

One theory of Ragnarok contained in [Norse Mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_Mythology_(Neil_Gaiman)) by Neil Gaiman stipulates that the beginning of the end begins with a never ending winter (As seen with the Viking village), causing a chain of events that bring about the destruction of the gods, the planet and reset human civilization. 

What makes me think that a character skin may lead to this? Well in all honesty, my investigation started when I was looking at a [post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8z6a0k/squad_leader_sledgehammer_and_this_banner_all/) /u/naisupizza which brought up the spider like symbol of both Sledgehammer and the Squad leader skins. This was quickly brushed off by other users as that they are part of the same set and that they have the same badge. But look closely: [This symbol](https://m.imgur.com/33VlphE) is not the same symbol as [Squad Leader's](https://m.imgur.com/BUN36tw). Similar yes, but different. The symbol on Sledgehammer is more of a [Nordic rune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runes) in style, a symbol. I was curious to see what the Nordic symbol for spider was and could only find modern artistic representations, rather than accurate symbols. One [source](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/2c7ov8/spiders_in_norse_culture/) was a post made on reddit in 2014, with a common point that Spiders don't appear in Norse Mythology, another theory was that spiders were bad luck to kill. Personally and I have nothing to back this up with, I believe Sledgehammers symbol is Epics Nordic symbol for their character [Ragnarok](https://m.imgur.com/account/SilentlyReading/images/8W7FC6V). The similarities between the Rune and the skin are very close. Now what does this mean for my theory... Maybe nothing, but Epic love to throw in small details and clues, something minor at the start of the season could be something big towards the end (The rocket in S4), and this simple Runic symbol could show the importance of Ragnarok.

This lead me to dig deeper into the Myth. Personally I don't believe that we'll be seeing any other ancient culture this season. I believe that the traveller has opened up the 9 ancient Nordic realms and has brought upon us Ragnarok and potentially the theme for next season: Post Apocalypse. As the season progresses I believe that we will start to see some drastic changes to the map, more snow, government involvement (The Rook skin), leading to an apocalyptic style map next season. This can allow for different game modes similar to the Thanos mode, where monsters are attacking the island. Flood modes where we must build up to survive. Even better would be to update challenges from find chests to find Runes (or clues) that will help us figure out what is going on.

Anyway... I've waffled on enough what do you think?",FortNiteBR

A better solution would have been to revert to the original switching mechanic they added before double pump was unexplainedly reintroduced.  Double pumping to fire quicker than intended should have been removed, but not the way they did with this update.  

I didn't run double pump, but there were many times i would hit someone with a heavy at midrange while rushing them then switch to my pump for the close up finishing shot, Or vice versa. 

It seems clear to me that Epic has been listening to the complaints about shotguns being the ""meta and overused"" and done their best to make shotguns a less viable weapon.  

There was no need to take a gun that could hit less than 10 damage and nerf it even more.

Why is the new ""meta"" any better? We now have FOUR weapons that have a fast fire rate/ high dps and capacity.  The only thing that changed is that close range fights end quicker with SMG/DrumGun than shotgun battles, WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT SHOTGUNS.


I can now laser someone with full shield/health in 1.5 seconds close range without hitting every shot, compared to having to pull of multiple shotgun hits with a delay between them for only 140 damage.  

The skill gap has been lowered with this new change, with every noob and his brother crouching with an smg and killing you before you even see them.


TL;DR

Keep SMGs the way they are now, removed the two second shotgun delay and replace with a mechanism to prevent firing faster than intended, so i can still carry two types of shotguns for different situations.

It takes about three shotgun shots to kill with the recent nerf on shotguns and on top of that the inconsistency is unreal, blue pumps doing damages like 14 and 28, making it literally useless against smgs, if all the smg shots hit you, you won't even get a chance shot the pump for the third time. Even having a build battle has become useless, they keep shooting with the smg from under once they have lost high ground until they get the kill. Idk man what are everyone's thoughts on this?

* Shotgun damage to structures has been reduced by 50% for Pump Shotgun, and 25% for both Tactical Shotgun and Heavy Shotgun.

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/royale-with-cheese/413708-6-6-shotguns-trap-balance-and-jetpack-update](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/royale-with-cheese/413708-6-6-shotguns-trap-balance-and-jetpack-update)

* Pump Shotgun
   * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
   * Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85
* Tactical Shotgun
   * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0

With these nerfs, shotguns are feeling underwhelming imho, the structure damage nerf made sense only with people double pumping, but now with that being removed a shotgun shouldn't be doing the damage it does now to structures.

Also, I don't necessarily think that the headshot multiplier should be reverted, but the base damage should be. I think the 10-15 extra damage for pump shotguns would be really nice for them.

I also couldn't find the patch notes, but I know there was a delay added to pump shotguns (not sure if it was rate of fire, or pulling it out) but that is another thing I have seen suggested to be reverted on the subreddit.

sidenote: I see a lot of people saying they are glad double pumping is gone, but idk if many of you watch pro players, but the patch after the structure damage was nerfed, a lot of pros had been running tac shotty/heavy with a tac smg/drum gun, and after the complete removal of double pump, their loadouts have not changed. So I think with them seeing the meta shifting, the average playerbase did not change yet, but then double pumping was removed. I thought the nerfs were good enough to even out double pumping being an option for some, but not meta for all.

tl;dr revert the nerfs to shotguns made prior to the removal of double pump, since they are no longer a issue with the lack of double pumping it is pointless to keep the nerfs on them.",FortNiteBR

18 the first shot, 9 the second.

Epic hears a ton about shotguns not doing enough damage (because they don’t), yet they are pandering to people who complain about being one pumped. 

Don’t like being one pumped? Keep the high ground. Build. Adjust your play style, and learn from your mistakes to become a better player. 

Shotguns are supposed to be a strong weapon, but making them unusable is creating a meta based around SMGs and drum guns, which in my opinion shouldn’t exist in such a prominent BR title.

How long did it take you to get to where when you get into a fight you can usually out build people? I've been playing Fortnite for about a month and a half. I taught myself to be decent at building in Playground Mode, can build a tower very fast and can build ramps and floors when i need to in order to get something or somewhere. My problem is that I am so uncomfortable in the game that when i get into a battle i tend to freeze up all together because I get stuck on the build or not build question. So what ends up happening is I can go toe to toe at first, then they start building, I stand still for a split second to think ""Hmmm... maybe I should build too. lol nvm ill just stay on the fucking ground and \*let him obliterate me from above"" ;)\*  and when I'm in that situation I tell myself that I dont need to build because I already have his health low and only need to hit him a few more times, but in reality I know its because I'm just not comfortable building yet I guess. 

So my questions are: 

1. How did you get good at building? did you consciously work on it or did it just finally start to come together?

2. Even now that you are a good builder are you 100 percent comfortable with your ability to build in pressure situations or is there no such thing as being totally confident in a build battle?",FortNiteBR

First, I think that Epic should go the MW2 route and make everything OP so nothing is OP. This might seem stupid, but hear me out. Double shotgun in any form is completely gone. I think if Epic were to buff the shotguns back to their previous state, players would be much happier with the meta as they wouldn't be forced to run an SMG or Drum Gun along with their shotgun. I also think they should remove drop off damage on the Hand Cannon and Revolvers. These guns should reward players for being able to hit their targets, and currently they do not. Finally, I think explosives such as C4, RPG, and the GL should all recieve a nerf to some degree. Currently, these can all destroy some of the most intricate builds, and I think it would be more fair if somebody couldn't just shoot on rocket and take down a double ramp/floor/wall/ramp. I think this would balance the game as a whole as well as open up many more different and interesting metas than we currently have.

Its definitely impossible to use 2 shotguns at once as there is know a timer and with the time to kill with the tac smg and drum gun, which most people seem to be using. I think that the shotguns were good where they were, but there is almost no point in using them now because the pump is slower than my grandmother's driving, and (for me) the tac shotty is the king of 8 damage. I think that shotguns should go back to the way that they were because it seemed fairly balanced, it was almost always a battle of aim, whoever hit the headshot would most likely win. Know, if you miss your first shot with the shotgun, most likely the opponent will just pull out a tac smg, because nowadays its shotty and smg. What are your thoughts on the shotty change?

If I land in a quite location on the map, loot up, I'm often able to make it to the top 10 with a couple of kills. However, if I land in a POI I usually find myself dying very quickly. After analysing my gameplay I've realised I have no idea what to do when I land on the roof of a house and someone lands close to me. I usually loot up (guns, ammo, chests and mats from breaking the furniture) and just stand on the roof of the house, look around and attempt to pick of some players with my AR. 

Similarly, when I rush someone in a house I just go onto the roof of the house and wait for them. Both these situations result in me getting killed or leave me with very low health, and so I often die to the first player I see after leaving the POI. 

Any advice would be really be appreciated. ",FortNiteBR

LTM

-Pistols and Traps

-Double everything (Mats,Ammo, and maybe even health and DAMAGE, nah maybe not)

-Absolutly no building 

IDEAS

-Add in argon assault rifle, Helium shotgun and Krypton pistol from save the world (Look them up), this will add a new ammo type but will be more scarce

-Not an idea but we need more Shotguns and Scoped snipers

- add in the healing pad from STW but it can only go up to the health 85

-Option for no skins to select their person

-Add more customization for other skins like dark Voyager being blue instead of orange/red 

-Spray paint can color over enemys

- Since epic Adds a new idea every season, for season 6 to have custom bullet trails instead of plain with

-In the store to have Loading screens, trails and bullet trails to buy

-Trading but can only trade 3 times a week because if it was unlimited you would just trade your friends a skin and when you done playing he would trade it back, you can also trade vbucks(prob coming tommorow tho)

-Mega slurp juice goes up to 50 shield and health but takes 1 minute to go up all the way

-Sharper pickaxes to do this you need to find an anvil and get 400 steel and it does 75 damage and not 50, can only Max up to 100 damage with being 200, but the sharper it gets the longer it takes to hit and the 2x circle will be more spread out

-Now for the worst ideas that will prob never come ever

-A bike in fortnite and it's faster than the shopping cart and it can hold 2 people with one on the pegs

-(Really bad idea) Animals or enemys in the game, animals could be killed and once they are killed you get a piece of meat and you can eat it raw or cook it on a campfire, for enemys it's to deal with the issues of people in the storm with loads of meds

-Option to have scopes on weapons or not, not the thermal gun though, such as no scope on bolt action but can put on a hunting rifle maybe

Skins(No gliders, or pickaxes, I'm not that crative)

-Aztec theme skin

-If you have the founders pack before it's free maybe to choose a hero of your choosing to also be in Battle royale(Obviously no perks)

-Later in the year for Halloween skins to be a Vampire(With glider being a bat) and A ghost

-Have the 5 dollar pack for 500 vbucks always out without the skin if bought(Idea sorry)

-For Switch users to have Nintendo themed skin, Mario can have a koopa with wings as a glider and a hammer as a pickaxes and link can have the botw glider with the master sword being a pickaxes

-For Xbox users can have a Master Chief helmet with wearing a UNSC CORP shirt with the pickaxe being a gravity hammer and glider idk

-Mobile can get a pickaxe that's a selfie stick and a back bling of a backpack of a logo with either being Android or apple, whatever your playing on

-i don't play too much pc only rainbow six and GTA, but can you think of any exclusives

Hope you liked these ideas

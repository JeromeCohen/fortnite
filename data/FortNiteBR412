3,Valtieri,1515457372,7p34lx,22,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7p34lx/regarding_the_nature_of_daily_challenges/,36,Regarding the nature of daily challenges,"Some daily challenges are fun, and will be completed over the course of a regular night of play (""Open 7 chests"").  Others might be interesting challenges to get you to play with a weapon you don't often use.  These are great, I enjoy playing the game and I particularly enjoy changing my usual loadout to incorporate different weapons.

I am of the opinion that we should do away with the ""Place top X in solo/duo/squad"" type missions, for a couple of reasons.

1) Often times, my quests will be for solo matches when I would rather play with friends.  Or sometimes I will get group quests when none of my friends are online.  This leads to players either feeling disincentivized from grouping (bad), OR leads to playing a mode they might rather not (bad).


2) The quests that are formatted specifically to ""Place top X"" lead to more dramatic alterations in player behavior, which is a bad thing, in my opinion.  Last night both my Battlepass and Daily quest were ""Place top 12 in Squads - 0/5.""  I had no friends online, and I'm not ashamed to admit I spent 5 games in a row solo'ing into them (no fill), popping my parachute immediately, landing in a treetop somewhere, and hiding until ~30 players remained.  At which point I'd try to fight but inevitably die sooner rather than later.  The most reliable way for me to complete the quest *was to avoid playing the game.*

After those 5 games, I realized that those quests in particular were less of a fun and engaging shake-up, and more of a chore.  It's the difference between *""playing a game, and also doing challenges as a fun sidequest,""* versus *""just playing to get the quests done.""*  The former is a great addition to a video game.  The latter is boring and uninspired.

Curious what others think in this regard, but I personally would prefer to see quests of a more active nature, rather than ones encouraging functional AFKing.",FortNiteBR

I know there is gonna be a new shooting model soom but I sometimes don't understand why is bloom a thing. If guns have to be lasers maybe decrease damage and make time to kill slower.

Also, today I was crouching, not moving with a blue AR, there was an enemy less than 10 meters away and many shoots were missing, yes, i was holding trigger but still, there should be no bloom when aiming, being croush and not moving, and I have many wins and played enough to have missed, i was aiming, directly at the enemy but bullets will miss a lot.

Well I was thinking, what if they combined all of these into one map?

My main issue right now, and it's not a huge issue, is that visually the entire map hardly changes. Yeah some of the POI vary, but that shade of green with the same trees and climate just seems a bit too dominant.

What if all those aspects I mentioned earlier were included in one map, on different corners of the map.

A snowy ski- resort on one.
A desert like area on another.
An urban, city like environment.
A jungle, with ancient ruins on the last corner.

They all transition at the center into some tropical island area.

Again, this is all just brainstorming and could be tweaked to whatever y'all prefer. I'm just really interested in the thought of different climates/themes all in one map. ",FortNiteBR
18,FifaDK,1515451314,7p2fm7,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7p2fm7/after_166_matches_i_finally_got_my_first_solos_win/,5,After 166 matches I finally got my first solos win!,"I've been playing Fortnite for a while now, racking up 40 hours in-game time, not including special events. I've got 2 duo wins and 3 squad wins, but [never a solo win](https://imgur.com/3SIzSop). That was until today.



Having come 2nd in solo matches 11 times without winning (since I started counting), I decided to play rather passively this time around. Landed by the broken house next to the Loot Lake building and quickly gathered whatever weapons I could find. Two of which were blue Bolt Action Snipers. I went to loot the houses in B4, from a distance I could tell someone had looted them already and sure enough a guy ran out of there about 15 seconds later and began gathering wood, his first and only mistake. Poor kid didn't know what hit him, snipers are quite OP in solo ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). I took his green AR and started running back towards the circle, only to see that someone had taken the sniper that I left behind and was running the same way. He too feel by the hands of the lovely Bolt Action sniper. A good start by my standards.



As the safezone was in pretty open territory I spent the rest of the game hiding in bushes from where I could see almost all of the safe zone. I fired two shots at someone getting an airdrop far away, missing both as he was running, jumping and building instantly. Smart.


As the circle narrowed in on the E4 factories, so did the alive players count on me.



Eventually I found myself hiding in a tiny bush, spectating a battle and waiting for any of the fighting players to stand still for a good snipe. None did and eventually the winner of that battle started building an impressive base on top of the only hill left in the circle. Still I waited for a good sniping opportunity. 



Then I turned to my right, spotting a guy running with his tactical shotgun, at first he was running towards my bush and I was ready to shoot him just as he turned and ran behind some left over building. The guy on top of the base saw this, resulting in rockets flying dangerously close to me as I kept looking for an opportunity to kill the Ed, with his Castle on The Hill. 



The 3rd last guy then built up to the base, providing me with several opportunities to snipe him from good range as he was building up towards the man in the castle. I resisted, knowing that I had little cover to fend off the man's rockets if I did land a good snipe on the running opponent. They fought on the hill as the safe zone fell nicely on me and I prepared to shoot whoever was left once they descended from the hill.



To my shock a banner appeared on my screen and the familiar music started playing. My first thought was how the surviving guy had managed to kill me, but then I realised that it said **#1 Victory Royale!**. I won. Somehow I won.



I took [a screenshot](https://imgur.com/rHyw2bs) and read the message *''Moorhusm checked out early''*, realising that the final guy had run into the storm during his fight and was unable to get out in time after killing the other. After nearly 22 hours of playing solo matches I had finally gotten my first win, and I didn't even get the final kill. I figured that this was a typical Fortnite win and I hope you enjoyed reading about it. Now go ahead and slander me for not playing aggressively enough and using bushes till the dire end.

So I get downed in Dusty because I have nothing but a pickaxe. A gunfight commences near me and my other teammate gets downed. Now its up to the last teammate in Dusty to save us....And he does! He revives us both, I try to share my bandages between us. Now heres the problem. I thought I deserved a small potion seeing as I distributed the bandages, so I take 1 potion and give the other one back. The guy thinks theyre is entitled to both mini shields despite them not being the one that saved our asses. Im pretty confused at this point because I dropped the shield in their face. I ACCIDENTALLY shot because I was trying to drink it. He/she kills me. Our saviour, the reason we are alive starts to revive me, and this idiot kills us both.

TL:DR Guy saves our (me and teammames) asses in dusty, I share the bandages, I take one mini potion because I believe im entitled to it, he team kills me, and then team kills the guy who was reviving me.

Before you guys say I deserved to die because I stole the potion, Yes, I totally understand that, dickish behaviour from me perhaps. But to team kill the guy who went MASSIVE and revived us both? He couldve finished me off and moved on, but instead team kills him/her too? Very disgusting behaviour.",FortNiteBR

This game really gets me heated though especially switching over from cod. Believe me cod had its own ways of bullshitting a person such as dying one off good killstreaks, or getting trippled, or recently going through pay to win shenanagins. These are things that would get me heated but things happen so fast that you forget and move on versus fortnite. What really gets me about fortnite is that i can invest alot of time and still get shit on by other players. I can land at retail row, collect good loot and a few kills, move around the map and collect more loot and kills, make it to the final 5 and then die by some bullshit. Then that shit ends up on bcc trolling the next day. There goes 20 minutes. Thats definately is what gets me is that my invested time can just come back and shit all over and give me nothing in return. Believe me though i think this is one of the entertaining games on the market right now and does a great job of catering a free game to everbody. I do wish that they kept 50 v 50 fulltime as it is easy for beginners and you can expect better results than other game modes at a higher rate. Plus its just fun. I also wish they would add another map. Not gonna say what they should make but another map would be nice. Cosmetics. I know that they dont affect gameplay but it would be nice if they made it a little bit easier to get these cosmetics and if they added a bit more t o earn for us non season pass owners. Also if they always had a wacky game mode such as high explosives or sneaky silencers always in rotation that would be a nice addition to the game. Also during 50 v 50 if they can find a way so that you can communicate with your whole team that would be nice so maybe a proximity chat could be done. Lasty binoculars in this game would be nice.

I currently have 4000 v-buck that I paid, and I am very disappointed that fortnite pushes us to overconsumption by not indicating skins coming as in other games.

The fact is that for more than two months, I have not used my v-buck because I am always afraid that the following skins are better.

I know it's Fortnite's business model, playing on the fact that a cosmetic is available for a day or a week, to push the player to buy quickly as soon as he sees a beautiful cosmetic, but this is not very honest for those who pay with real money and help to make the game live.

What I would like, and I know that many players would like the same thing, is to have a fixed shop, to see all the skins, or see the skins that arrive the next days. For example, it's tiring to have to log in every day to check that the ""Slow Clap"" animation is not available

&amp;nbsp;

So before I played this game a lot I used to play Rocket League and I still do frequently. I love Rocket League's approach to DLC's (NOT LOOTBOXES FYI).  

They make 'deals' with movie companies for instance, working together and getting the car of a movie into the game, for instance:  
- [Batmobile](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rocketleague/images/e/e5/Batmobile_body_preview.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20171021182453)  
- [Delorean](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/rocketleague/images/9/95/DeLorean_Time_Machine_promo_art_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170530114548)  

Also other cosmetics items have been added as a collaboration, like Rick and Morty customizables:  
- [Rick](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ueJbNDX3Uo0/maxresdefault.jpg)  
- [Morty](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vhAvup_vkpI/maxresdefault.jpg)  

&amp;nbsp;

So here is my idea. I would love that some of the skins would have relation to movies/TV Series or other. With the gimmicky and funny style of Fortnite and especially with the skins that come out I would think that these additions would make for a real cash cow. I for one would love to see things as like:  
- [Star Wars](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/star-wars_1024.jpg) - Costumes and Lightsaber for Pickaxe for instance  
- [The A-Team](http://www.filmhoek.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-A-Team-acteur-Dirk-Benedict.jpg) - Skins like B.A. Baracus for instance  

&amp;nbsp;

These are just some of the ideas I have, but I for one assume a lot of people that are into these kinds of things would buy more skins this way. This works two ways as well, I mean sure there would be more interest in the shows or movies, but also the game would be linked to giants in media.

Let me know what you guys think, I for one would love such skins and would be willing to put in more money if these would come out.

I play on ps4 and I often pull out my blueprints, press R1 twice to get to the stairs but the blueprints get stuck on the floor. Sometimes I have the correct structure selected but it simply won't appear on screen. It limits my potential a lot. Maybe swap the floor and the stairs so the stairs would be second instead of third.

Another problem is that there's a delay between when you pull out your blueprints and when you can build which can be detrimental when trying to build in the middle of a gunfight

Been playing Fortnite BR for a little while now and just realized there's a bunch of new skins being released fairly quickly, but swinging an axe at hay and at some wooden doors still produces lag. This is just one example of quite a few bugs that I think are overdue for a fix.

Another thing that I see the community asking for (myself included) is kill cams. It's frustrating not knowing how you were killed and it just seems like a simple tool to add considering it's been around in many past shooters. It's also good for helping new players learn strategies. 

Don't get me wrong though. I think the skins are awesome, fun and add a lot to the game. I just think that the actual gameplay should come first and could use a slight tune up.

I've submitted two tickets so far(sent the first one, waited a day and they didn't respond - I waited half a day more and then went ahead and sent another support ticket and you guessed it - no response). I'm wondering if they're really busy with so many tickets or if they're just a bit lazy and don't want to handle it within a business day or less(like they claim they do).

I even private messaged two epic games staff members - one responded and the other didn't. I cannot play the game properly and I do need some assistance. Here is my previous reddit post:

111,RMEffinger,1515378819,7oveyf,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7oveyf/50_shield_suggestion_unpopular_opinion/,0,50 shield suggestion (unpopular opinion),"*Slurp juice, mini-shields, and normal shields*.

All commonly found things. Some of the easiest hoarding consumables in the game right next to bandages. Rightfully so since it stops bullets. But now we're in a situation where people are running around with 200HP with extra shields in their inventory. And I don't know about you, but I got a pretty good AR shot. I'll willingly drop a shotgun, SMG, pistol and sniper for extra shields. Even med kits and bandages. What does that say about shields?

They are extremely common to find. And I'm okay with having an unpopular opinion. As long as it's shared with the likes of Summit, Ninja, CDNThe3rd and Dakotaz.

Shields on paper are a fantastic thing. It's needed to win (sometimes) and literally saves your life. But 100 shield is just too much. But I think a nerf of 50 shield wouldn't hurt. Minis have been out long enough for me to confidentially say that I love them. I'll happily run around with 50 shield, take a couple shots, build, quick sip on on some minis to gunfight again. 

50 shield is just enough to tank some shots, survive a shotgun battle, eat a sniper or rocket. And just enough so you're not spending ages in a gunfight with someone picking apart each others shields until you both get pinched. ",FortNiteBR

My suggestion: The Mutombo finger wag. For those that aren’t basketball fans, Mutombo would block a player from scoring and then wag his finger as to say “Not today!”

A perfect example in game would be when people flank you or a bushy boi tries to catch you by surprise but you still kill them. The finger wag would be great!

Tons of people just hiding to outlive people,  and not even playing the game. Or worse you can only do the challenge in squad or solo...  A lot of us have limited time to play, so forcing us into a game mode that we don't want to play in isn't great. 

So I thought how about we suggest some new ideas. 

Here are some of my ideas:

-Get 3 kills in a match while crouching. 
-Cross the whole map in a single match. 
-Give a blue (or better) weapon to a stranger in your -squad. 
-Revive 5 strangers. (TKs don't count) 
-5 headshots in a round. 
-Fill your inventory with resources in a round. 
-Give ammo to a stranger. 
-Get the most kills in the round. (May need extra ui) 
-Get 2 melee kills in a round. 
-Destroy 20 enemy  building prices in a round. 
-first blood. 
-Get to the top 3 with just your  pickaxe. 
-open 5 airdrops. 
-down someone who is under the influence of a boogie bomb.

Some people commented saying refunds are not possible, which, I understand because then people could constantly refund items.  Since refunding items does not lose EPIC money considering you have already purchased the packs, I suggest they allow 1 refund per person for accidents such as this.

Or, if that is not an option they can/want to do.  I think at the very least, there should be a “Confirm Purchase” page.  For example, you click an item, click “Purchase” and instead of it outright buying it, it then asks you to “Press (Blank) to confirm” or “Press (Blank) to cancel”.

I’m sure there are people out there that use them, but it’s safe to say that the vast majority don’t pick them up. I rarely ever get killed by them, nor do I ever see them on bodies after killing. Personally, I’ll even go as far to use a common burst over a purple Scoped AR. 

I believe the issue is the bullet spread. The damage on the rifle is fine, I don’t know the specifics but I believe it’s in the high 20s with a high 50 headshot. The bullet spread is very very similar to the normal assault rifles. But this can’t work with the Scoped ARs, when their is a short delay in between each shot it really increases the time to kill with this gun. Considering that people are now becoming very proficient with building the time to kill is becoming even shorter. This gun needs a serious buff. If it had a very tight bullet spread like the a sniper rifle then this gun could become viable. Because quite frankly I’m sick of seeing end circles full of people with Scars. The pace of the game will be much more different and in my opinion, better, if this gun became a bigger threat. Share your thoughts

But after around 5 losses now because someone spams an RPG at me non-stop until the rocket inevitably hits (and one-shot kills me because I don't have any shield). In one of the games I just had, I built a base and so did the other player - I managed to headshot him twice with my Legendary Scar, and he had full shield - so he had 4 health left. We build bases fanatically and he relentlessly spams rockets at me - so I do the rational thing and proceed to build walls until he has to reload. But then, one of the rockets manages to get inside my base and I die instantly. No skill at all.

Another game the opposing player built up to my base, and I caught him with a headshot from my Pump. Sadly the bloom gets the better of me and it doesn't kill him - then he jumps up, fires his RPG, and I die.

I personally wish that the RPG doesn't do 125 damage, which it does now. If you don't have a shield, even a day-one player can slaughter you. At least with the Grenade Launcher it takes effort to get a hit - but with the RPG it's point-and-click and you'll succeed. Personally I think the RPG could use a damage nerf, because right now an explosive device that does 125 damage and has perfect accuracy seems a little overpowered. It's difficult to counter, too. In both of my above examples, even building couldn't save me.

My Xbox Live account is littered with vid captures of utter bullshit due to bullet registration and 'bloom'. I'm tired of putting dozens of bullets into someone and none of them registering. I'm tired of sniping someone standing still and watching the bullet go through their model. I'm tired of losing to gunfights when I have their height, health, and positioning advantage because bullets don't connect. I'm tired of consoles shitty and incredibly over-sensitive aim assist playing against me and the inability to turn it completely off. I'm tired of the entirely un-fun and frustrating 'randomness' associated with gunplay in this game. A bullet travels at 2,500ft per second, I shouldn't need to 'lead' a target with an AR or burst.

Fortnite is playing poker with a stacked deck and I'm the gambling addict. You're ability to win has less to do with your actual talent than it does complete RNG luck with your spray and that's a model I can't and won't get behind. I won't waste more of my time 'git gud' when the game works against you.

PUBG has it's cheaters, H1Z1 has it's quirks, but at least the bullet goes where I tell it to every damn time. Its unfathomable to me that a survival game where you have a single life to kill and defend has the absolute worst, most random bullet registration. It's almost as if it's designed to prevent you from becoming better. 

Fortnite is a great game at its core, completely ruined by its roll-the-dice-and-hope approach to bullet registration and targeting. I'm done beating my head against a wall I won't ever get through due to programming. Peace.",FortNiteBR

Some suggestions to make it actually fit the theme:

- Nighttime only 
- No shields
- Let us have traps
- Remove the silencer machine gun, the two pistols are enough
- Have the map area be smaller.  Maybe cut off 25-30% of the map from the start.  ",FortNiteBR

Im sure everyone here has experienced team kiĺlers. Some more than others, some less. Lately when i tried to play squad because of quests i got teamed with TKs of course. I even shared my loot with my teammates only to get kiĺled by them. This went on for another 4 or 5 matches i quit reporting them because i don't see a point in that. So in the last two games i was teamed again with, you guessed it, tesmkillers. Everytime i see them approaching i am more carefull of their actions. So i give them shields like a teamplayer and they start to shoot at me.
I run away and look back just to check if this was on purpose or not. So they shoot again. I lost my shit and killed all of my teammates. Am i not any different than them for doing this? Im just tired of wasting almost 10 min again just to land in a team with TKs.

Playing squad mode with two mates and a random (to be named team killer). One of my mates was looting and found a gold pistol which he picked up. Shortly thereafter, the teamkiller killed him and took his weapons. He then tried to run to mine/my friends position and kill us. 

As soon as a saw this, we immediately wanted our revenge and he was knocked down (slaughtered) immediately. Having brought justice to the great nation of fortnite, we decided to instead savour our kill and to continue to revive him and then drop him again, just too show how pissed we were at team killing. Time went on, and eventually the storm came in and we decide to let the storm take him. We spent so much time on this kill/revive routine that by the end there were only 14 left. To make the situation even better, we actually went on to win the round. SWEET JUSTICE RIGHT??? Wronggggg

We could see that once he died, he wasn’t spectating us anymore (which is pretty normal) so I decided to send him a screen cap of the winning sign, and admittedly, certainly wasn’t very nice about it (text conservation below). I know that I shouldn’t have said fuck you, but in the height of winning the game and getting revenge, it just felt soooo right to shove it his face. But I guess two wrongs don’t make a right. Bottom line, I was banned from Xbox live for 24 hours, I guess it could be worse. But just doesn’t seem fair for someone that was teamkilling from the get go, and then complains and I get banned. If anything we should both be banned. But I understand that it’s probably difficult for Xbox to monitor or fortnite to apply player bans. I’m just shitty and need to take it out somewhere (apologies my fellow redditors). 

I wanted to post a couple of screen shots of the text convo during this whole thing, but I wanted to keep it all in one txt post, so I’ve detailed it below. The conversation started midway through the kill/revive revenge.

Xbox chat
(started midway through kill/revive of teamkiller):
Teamkiller: please stop

(After we killed him)
Team killer: fuck you      
Me: don’t team kill

(After we won)
Me: and we won hahahaha....fuck you + screen shot of winning title


(Three days later) (ban was applied) 
Team killer: thanks for the win lol.
Team killer: sorry for team kill I was just very annoyed at my brother and I also smashed my controller.

(END)

He apologised which is fine, but I’ve been banned because of his actions (I can see the complaint was lodged at the same time the last message was sent, so most likely him)

I certainly understand that I’m probably just a bit of a salty thic boi, and I know that my response wasn’t the right way, but fuck it, DONT TEAM KILL AND THERE WONT BE ANY PROBLEMS.

Can’t get the case reviewed, so looks like I’m taking a 24 hour break as I can’t chat to friends. Thanks teamkiller.

Just because Epic is active on this reddit and they talk to the community doesn't make them some crazy gods that deserve 50+ praise posts a day. The game should be fixed and playable before new skins and dlc is added. It's actually stupid that we get cookies and guys with ridiculous afros and dab emotes before we can properly stand on stairs without falling through them or have a build system that doesn't feel like a laggy mess. You should be able to build as fast as you can press the buttons on console so tell me why the game decides to build 6 floors before it builds my stairs losing me the game. Even on pc people are falling though their buildings and getting shot through their already placed walls. I have an example right here of me getting shot through 2 layers of my building ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kLU6d8SxMc ). It's actually stupid. Lets not forget ghost shots not dealing damage or shotguns doing 6 damage when you know damn well it was a direct shot and didn't graze the enemy. Fix the damn sniper shots going through people. Fix people running through doors and crazy framerate drops mid battle. theres so much more wrong with this game that needs to be fixed. Let me configure my controls the way i want.

Realized it doesn’t work as firstly the controls are mostly different (no combat pro on PS4) and there is some kind of auto-aim to kill zombies so that’s that. 

Wish Epic games made a mode or something to practice with AI as the skill gap seems be too big to jump right in BR .",FortNiteBR

It's been ridiculous in my last few games. In one game, I land at Anarchy at the start of the game and someone in the main house has already downed two large shields and has a tactical. I had to immediately run away. Never before have I seen that. Then in another game, I clear Retail Row, and got the new legendary silenced pistol. Sick, amirite? Unfortunately, I lost the only shield I had in a gunfight, but I had a medkit so I had 100 health. Good enough. I sneak up on a guy, and of course, he has full shield. I still managed to knock off all of it, and drop him below 50 health with the silenced pistol, and then he just turns around and one shots me with the pump. I would have been annoyed but accepted it....until I spectated him for a minute and watched as he looted my items, hid, and then proceeded to heal with a medkit, and drink two more large shield potions. Then the next game, I ran into three dudes, one after another, all with full shield, and the third guy gets the kill on me in top 15. Sorry for the rant, but am I getting so damn unlucky, or did they really dramatically increase shield drops? 

TLDR; Too many damn shield potions ",FortNiteBR

306,connorreyes02,1515194400,7of8i6,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7of8i6/making_all_weapons_useful/,2,Making All Weapons Useful,"I think that all weapons in Fortnite Battle Royale should be useful. Weapons that need changing are the Scoped AR, Revolver, and the Smoke Grenade. First off, the Scoped AR needs to be more accurate and do slightly more damage; the recoil is too high and you can't hit anything. Most people will drop an Epic Scoped AR for any type of AK or M4. Second, the Revolver should be more based off of skill instead of RNG. I like that it's hard to use and is fun to use at the same time, but it's nearly too hard and even with perfect aim, you may never hit your target. I feel like the accuracy deserves a small buff to make it more often used. And lastly, the Smoke Grenade; I think that it's practically useless and nearly everyone would avoid picking it up unless they have a free inventory spot, it's the least desired item in the game for most people, and has very little viable uses. I think that it should be changed so it fits into the game better, but I don't have any direct suggestions. Please share your feedback and whatever else you have about this topic &lt;3",FortNiteBR

I am a subscriber to many gaming subreddits, among those are WW2, Destiny 2, Battlefront 2 and other fairly new games.

But you, you are doing what all these developers are not doing, communicating with your playerbase, you listen to us, accknowledge us and our ideas/rants or whatever it might be.

Fewer and fewer developers are doing this these days and I must say you are one of the few developers I can truly say that I really like.

A day or two ago someone jokingly said that there were no ammo caches at Dusty Depot, didn't take long until you answered with 'We' ll add some in an upcoming update'.

I see many threads with the flair 'EPIC comment' in it. I really feel that you guys do look at this subreddit and you take the feedback we give you and you try your best to please us.

You give us regular updates on what's happening, you tweaked the boogie bomb so fast after we complained that the 10 sec timer was to much, you give us new LTM's regulary and you add new weapons with pretty much every update.

Thank you for listening to us and actually care about us.

Let me explain.  The main campfire complaint that I see people jumping to is this...""I hope people dont just build big bases and put a campfire at the top so they camp up there.  It's going to be so annoying.""

I tend to agree with this worry to a certain extent.   

If we're only able to build campfires on the ground it's going to do two things...

One, it will force players to get creative with their placement.  Maybe around trees?  Behind buildings?  In a small valley etc...

Two, it will make bases far more interesting.  Imagine building a 1x1 base and putting the campfire at the bottom?  You'd see far more based built with winding stairs that would enable base dwellers to go up and down with ease, and base attackers incentive to get in on the ground floor.  Imagine hacking your way in and having winding stairs going up to attack the base occupants?

And what's weird is it goes away the longer I play. My game will randomly tab me out and minimize me out of nowhere. I am in full screen.


Things I have tried:

*Completely uninstalled gpu drivers with DDU and installed latest

*Set Priority in Windows on FortNite to Max

*Disabled Windows Full Screen Optimization or whatever

*Switching from full screen to windowed and back during game

*Closing all background programs and antivirus

*Checking task manager for any odd processes running

Like I said it goes away after about 30 minutes of playing but that first 30 minutes is rough. It is tabbing me out anywhere from a couple times a minute to once every 5 minutes. 



My computer specs:

i7 7820x @ 4.7

GTX 1070

X299 Strix E Board

32gb @ 3600mhz

2 Monitors, both 1080p. One is 144hz, other is 60hz

Let me start off by saying that the only way that Battle Pass tiers and your player level are related is that you get stars for levelling up. Gaining new tiers on your battlepass is actually pretty easy, if time consuming once you make it farther.

**How you gain Battle Pass stars:**

- Complete daily challenges for 5 stars

- Levelling up gives you 10 stars for every level that ends in 0, 5 stars for every level that ends in 5, and 1 star for all other levels.

- Buy 10 stars for 150 V-Bucks

This means that just by doing your two daily challenges you are guaranteed one Battle Pass level every day. On top of this, you also gain 2.3 tiers for every 10 levels you achieve (with the exception of the first 10 as you don't get a star for being level 1). **So if you complete your daily challenges 60 days out of a season, you only have to reach level 45 to earn level 70 of the battle pass.**

**Edit:** This guy has a good post explaining the xp increase at higher levels and has a spreadsheet linked to tell you what level you need to reach while doing dailies to finish the Battle Pass https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7o4c1k/you_need_roughly_1_million_xp_to_reach_lvl_100",FortNiteBR

But let me explain. 

Me and my 2 buddies get paired with a random per usual. 
I usually find a 4th before playing but no one was responding to my posts so we said fuck it. 
Now when ever we start a game with a random I always invite them to the party. 
In hopes that it’s a cool person and we stayed partied up for the rest of the night. 

So I send the invite and he ignores it. 
Fine. 
We drop the bus. 
He doesn’t follow but he’s somewhat near by. 

My two buddies and I get into a battle with another squad. It’s crazy. It’s hectic. Last a good 3 minutes. Both my buddies get downed and one dies. I finally end up squeaking out 2 kills. (I’m not very good)Loot every where. 
I start reviving my downed partner. 

And what do I see on my map. 
Our rando team mate getting closer and closer. 
While I’m reviving my guy, he runs up and TAKES ALL THE LOOT!! 
The audacity! 
Of this man to just come to the battle at the very end and just take my shit...

So we start dancing at him, Crouching, Then i start sending him warning shots. then I try to kill him but he downs me(I told you i wasn’t very good). So my buddy blasts his face. I tell my buddy to pick me Up. 
Once he does, I start picking the random dude up, but once there is one second left, I stop, and blast his face with my shot-gun. 

Was what I did bad? Sure. 
But I feel it was validated. You can’t show up to work late and then take the pay check for all my hard work!  I gave him the chance to drop us something. But he ran. So screw him. 
I would understand if this was down voted. 
But I had to share. 

Edit: Go ahead Epic, hit me with the Ban Hammer. 
Cuz if this happens again, I’ll do it again.

I play this game usually with friends after work. But it pisses us all, that Epicgames forces us to play solo for those dailys. But without the Daily 5 Stars, you aren't allowed to rank up your battlepass to max. Am I honestly the only one who thinks this is just bullshit?

I don't like to be forced to play some kind of weapon (like pistol) or kind of a modus (like solo). And honestly, I don't like to be forced every day to play this game just to rank up a pass which I had to pay for it. I honestly loved this game when there were no dailys or any reward.",FortNiteBR

Make it a spear, and make is so you hold the trigger to pull back your arm, resulting in a stronger throw. This feature would prevent it from becoming basically a powerful melee weapon, and become a more stealthy short to mid range sniper. This spear would do heavy damage, and would be a slower heavier projectile relative to a sniper. Also, you can only carry one per item slot, though it is retrievable.

Today I would like to discuss the lack of damage that smg's have. They are the worst weapon in the game by far. I have perfect tracking and it takes me 3 FULL clips to kill a downed person. They are a waste of light ammo as they are better used in revolvers. 

Secondly, I would like to discuss the smoke bomb, which imo, is the best item in the game. They are far more useful than any meds, shields, and even most weapons in this game. For example, if someone is pushing you and you don't have perfect aim like I do, you can smoke grenade yourself and turn into a bush. When the smoke clears, the enemy won't know where you went so they will run pass you. This leaves you a perfect chance to spray 3 full smg clips into the back of the enemy for them to only take 10 damage and they 1 shot you with a grey revolver.

So in conclusion, Fortnite Battle Royale is in a great state of imbalance which needs to be fixed ASAP as the imbalance makes this game literally unplayable. ",FortNiteBR

However it would be great if the console players had the option to choose between Performance and Better Graphics. I personally would love to play this game on 60 fps and I know there are limitations to the original XOne and PS4, but I personally am ok with lower graphics but better frame rate and I know there are probably more people like me who would rather play this game with higher fps.

So having an option to choose between better graphics and better performance would be great.

Thanks for the great game.",FortNiteBR

I think maybe making the delay between shots carry over to all pump shotguns in your bag would be a solution for this.,FortNiteBR

My aim was terrible the entire game and I was fully expecting to die in the top 25 or so since the best I could was ambush people and scavenge for guns.  
  
  
Until I found you Mr. Brick.  For some reason, you had not a single weapon to your name, not a piece of ammo, but when I gunned you down breaking a rock you had 999 Brick.  Why? I'll never know.  But it saved my life.
  
  
When the final circle came I was in the last two.  The other guy was better with better aim.  I had to re-shield and heal from taking sniper shots while I missed every return shot.  But the circle was ending on a hill with a steep slope. And I had 999 Brick.  I built walls and floors and stairs and spike traps, covering every inch of what would be left. My opponent was in the basement level, desperately trying to break his way up without running into a spike trap as the circle closed, forcing him closer and closer to the slope he couldn't climb.  As I heard desperate destruction below I continued to roof over the slope as far as I could, even out into the Storm.  Eventually, as the circle closed in on even me, I saw victory as he perished to the Storm without me having landed any decent damage on him.  
  
  
Thank you Mr. Brick for saving my ass and giving me a win that I didn't deserve.  Also sorry random #2 guy for basically killing you in the least confrontational way possible.",FortNiteBR

I'll most likely answer each in up to 12-24h.*

Going along with the information of the latest purchase for the Battle Pass being January 4th(11th if you spend the gained V-Bucks for Time Save).

[Here is some Information on grinding the XP.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zpjnvlj-osOywNYkvDMcx-YktPrpPcN5MmXDWzlmX2I/edit#gid=0) (might be off by a few thousands, I'm not 100% sure)

The real grind begins when you want to level from lvl 90 onwards, it will be really tideous, so plan ahead  and dont think if you already reached 50 you easily reach 100. 

I hope this information provides some further information on the Pass, also for the next Seasons :)

**Edit:** Since some people ask if the will make it here is the post i refered to and Chiefandcouncil also mentioned:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7k26sa/the_hard_numbers_behind_the_battle_pass_and_why/

To TL:DR it: You gain 229 points from leveling and need 461 from dailies. edit: only 690 BP needed overall, because you dont need to reach rank 1(ty for the correct)

**Calculate how many level ups you need:**

Try using this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VuLAnoZ4y_h8CittPBafQh6ObCcb16mFQZQoYyIpopQ/edit#gid=0) to calcualte your level ups needed if you keep the dailies around. Just save the spreadsheet for yourself and edit the Your Tier and Days Left and it will tell you how many lvl ups are roughly needed. If it exceeds your cap, you sadly wont be able to complete that in time, except using V-Bucks.



**Edit 2:** As AnUnlikelyUsurper mentioned here is a good [spreadsheet in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7l4xwl/determining_of_daily_challenges_needed_to/) for determining your needed daily challenges assuming you got lvl 100.

First, this is a reminder that clips showing teamkillers, players supposedly teaming up in solo matches, and similar claims of cheating or hacking are not allowed.  We know this is an issue, Epic knows this is an issue, and they're working on improving their enforcement.  The best way to help Epic out and actually have offenders punished (as well as demonstrate the scope of the problem) [is to submit a report directly through this link](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/customer/portal/articles/2843190).

Second, we need your help!  We work as fast as we can and will be expanding the team in the next few days as I step down, but with a thousand posts per day and tens of thousands of comments, we need your eyes to help identify offending posts or comments as you see them.  Please feel free to use the ""report"" feature any time you think a link, post, or comment might break [the subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/rules).

Finally, applications for the new moderator positions are now closed, we'll be reaching out to chosen applicants within the next few days.

Could make for some funny and interesting plays.  Good use would be baiting out snipers or Bush wookies, using the seconds the opponent is distracted to reposition or flank, or make it look like you've run away when in fact you are still hiding in cover.

Either that or it is a bug that conveniently works in Epics favor.,"For background info: [A post I made the other day reguarding the daily challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7lc0l5/epic_can_you_please_not_allow_every_daily_to_be/).

I don't so the solo daily challenges. I abandon them in hopes of getting a duo / squad / kill / search type quest instead.

So in the first few days of the battlepass (day 1-3 I believe) I hadf a solo quest which I abandoned, and it gave me another solo quest. No big deal, its rooughly a 1 in 5 chance of getting a solo ralted quest out of the pool of quests available. Here's tyhe dodgy part. Literally every single day since, I abandon the solo quest, and it gives me another solo quest.

It has now been 21 days in a row, so assuming odds of 1 in 5 of a solo quest, thats (1/5)^21 = 0.0000000000002% chance. There would be more chance of me winning back to back lotteries that getting the same random quest that many days in a row.

There are ONLY 2 conclusions here:

1. It is a simple bug, in which case it needs to be fixed, and the battlepass extended because it's not what people payed for.

2. Epic has deliberately designed the swapped in quests to have a high chance of being the same type of quest that was swapped out. This would slow battlepass progress for some people, and incentivise people to spend v-bucks on it if there is something they miss near the end of the season.",FortNiteBR

My friends and I love this game. Don't get me wrong. But sometimes some things about the game makes us super salty. Like shields, building, bandages only going to 75.

So we always rant about a fantasy where EPIC makes a game mode where there's *NO* shields, building, nothing is able to be destroyed, bandages heal to 100, and there's no weapon rarities. 

Just the core of the game where you need to rely on your gun, and placement. Obviously there's problems like map design, building design, etc.

But it's just our fantasy. ",FortNiteBR

The overall general consensus from what i've seen was that it should be at least halved in time **and** stop upon taking damge. This way you would get rewarded for hitting your shots and get the ""first mover advantage"" (You got the first shot, hit the further ones and you're likely to win the fight).

The way it currently is, is that you have an AOE effect that you cannot dodge, and that you cannot do anything about whatsoever after being hit. If you're hit with it you're 99.9% dead, because anything skill related is taken out of the game.

*But.. but.. it is just essentially the same as a flash!!*

No, it is not. Neither does a flashbang stop me from shooting (See prefire when e.g. holding an angle in CS:GO), nor am i unable to dodge it. Additionally, when dealing with flashbangs, say in CS:GO you are very likely to be in a position where you have cover or can get into cover, where as in Fortnite, it often is not so.

*You are just salty that you die to it! It is fine!!!*

Maybe, i've killed several people with it myself, and every second time i felt bad because it is absolute bullshit. I hate getting kills with it just as much as i hate getting killed because of it.

Proposal:

EITHER you should be have SOME WAY to dodge it (Just like you can dodge a flashbang by not looking into its direction), OR you should be able to fight back once you've been hit. The way it currently is, again, just entirely removes skill from a fight. The person that manages to boogie somebody close to him gets the kill more often than not, and i feel like this game so far was very skill based, and should be kept so. Eventhough i strongly believe such a thing should have absolutely no room in a game that generally is based around skill (See them reworking the shooting model, removing bloom on first shot further embracing consistency and skill) i believe this could make it into a thing that fits the game.

**TL;DR** Current boogie bomb completely removes skill from fights because you cannot dodge it, at all, and upon being hit you're unable to defend yourself, at all.",FortNiteBR

Had an idea that I thought might improve the 50v50 game mode if they rotate it back in.

A 50v50 capture the flag

2 buses, as suggested by others, on opposite halves of the island. One team has the flag and the other team is the attacking team. 
When each team lands, they get a two minute grace period where a storm wall prevents fighting.
Both teams would look for loot but the defending team would also build a large base around their ‘flag’ or checkpoint.

After the 2 mins, fighting can start. You can see all 50 teammates on the minimap. Winning team is either the one to kill all opposition and/or defend/steal the flag and hold for a period of time.

Just a basic idea at the moment and I welcome any suggestions or improvements

This way, when you get team killed, you drop no loot. 

The only downside to this is in scenarios where it may be beneficial to quickly kill your downed teammate to pick up a launcher for the final kill, but team killing is such a niche strategy that rarely gets used. 

This idea also punishes teams who are carelessly shooting/throwing grenades.

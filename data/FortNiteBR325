But yet a trap doesn't fucking even take down enough to bring someone down? Fucking stupid. Shotguns are OP. Traps are underpowered.

I know people don't care but I'm sure there's other people who feel alike.,"I've been playing this game since about December now and have advocated and had nothing but great things to say about Fortnite. They're ruining the game and the player base is going to find other things more enjoyable. 

There has been known bugs, bugs that should be a huge deal to epic and at the top of there priority list but just get neglected. Oh but it's okay, we have jetpacks and hoprocks and a new shopping cart coming soon. I used to love this game and now I can't stand it. Key mechanical bugs and glitches will continue to be neglected and more colorful characters and fireworks guns that have heat seeker missiles that kill multiple targets will be introduced and the game will become over saturated with items that take away from the building component that got us all so interested.

I have no desire to play anymore and I know you'll prolly say something like ""just leave"" but I'm also sure a lot of players feel the same.

-inconsistent shotgun damage across all shotguns
-revive bug (can't revive)
-hitmarkers without damage
-phasing through pieces or pieces appearing to be placed when they're not
-jump fatigue 
-packet loss (ping skyrocketing)
-weird placement of building pieces
-items becoming invisible when dropped
-bloom
 
Oh you want bugs fixed? Not right now, just strap a jetpack on and hoprock into a shopping cart while we add more unneeded items and some cool cosmetics. Keep neglecting actual gameplay though, we won't notice.

In fact I'd be willing to do a test of some kind to find the actual percentage. The early game should not be dominated by Shotguns, if you don't find a Shotgun within the first 3 minutes of the match your chances of winning should not go down. 

I'd propose an accuracy buff to SMGs, Semi\-auto Pistols, and Assault Rifles to make them all more reliable in the early and late game. Don't get me wrong, these weapons aren't bad. But, they can't compete with Shotguns more than maybe 25&amp;#37; of the time. I'd like to be able to have more variety within my loadout, and not be forced to carry a two shotguns just to compete with the good players. ",FortNiteBR
10,ItsAtxm,1527623948,8n25vr,16,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8n25vr/why_i_dislike_the_jetpack/,1,Why I Dislike the Jetpack,"The jetpack is a fun addition to the game and it‚Äôs understandable why so many people like it, but as someone whit a more competitive side it seems to be a bad addition to the game, and here‚Äôs why...

  ‚Ä¢OP- The jetpack isn‚Äôt too OP to the point where whatever player wearing it will win, if the player without the jetpack is better than the one with it they will most likely still win. The problem I have is that if two players, around the same skill level, are fighting and one has a jetpack the one with the jetpack has an advantage (I‚Äôd say the jet packer should win 75% of the time). I think the jetpack ruins what would have been close fights without jetpacks and gives too much of an advantage.

  ‚Ä¢More Randomness- As I‚Äôve previously stated the jetpack gives too much of a competitive advantage and because of that the player that‚Äôs LUCKY enough to find a jetpack will have more of an advantage than they normally would. There‚Äôs already enough randomness with weapon tiers and drop chances that the jetpack just adds way more, especially since the jetpack only comes in the highest rarity only a handful of players in a single game will be able to obtain it, giving those LUCKY enough a big advantage.

  ‚Ä¢Lasts Too Long- In my experiences the jetpack isn‚Äôt even a one fight tool, it can last between 2-4 good build fights against players of almost equal skill level. If having a big advantage over 1 other player wasn‚Äôt bad enough the jetpack lasts long enough to give someone the advantage over 2-4 players that would normally be equal matchups.

  ‚Ä¢Does Too Much- Not only does the jetpack give you a big advantage in build fight but it also allows you to take no fall damage. If a player messes up by falling off a build fight or ramping up too high then getting shot down hey shouldn‚Äôt be able to save themselves from their blunder.

Alternative- I like the idea of adding new ways to play the game but I think the jetpack is too much power for one man. A better idea would be to split up the jetpacks abilities into maybe a backpack that gives you a double jump and limit the jump you get, and maybe an ‚Äúextra chute‚Äù backpack that allows you to open a chute(glider) if you fall from somewhere.

Sorry for the long post and I want to here what people have to say about the jetpack so feel free to argue with what I said.

tl;dr Jetpack gives too much of an advantage, could be nerfed by splitting its abilities(ascending fast without building, taking no fall damage) into separate items and limiting the ‚Äúcharge‚Äù they have.

One fix could be having the storm close in from the top(to an extent) as well as from all sides to prevent sky bases as the game progresses. This wouldn't impact the gameplay too much in which early game, most people would not have enough materials to build to the sky anyways. Sky bases only become a problem mid to late game and become almost un-counterable due to the low range of shotguns and safety from the jetpacks. However, if the storm was to close in from the top as well, sky bases would be impossible and force players to move down closer to where they are vulnerable. Just a suggestion.",FortNiteBR

Regardless of whether the stream was 100 seconds or 120 seconds, anyone watching the streams (and wanting to stream snipe) doesn‚Äôt know when the next match will start...

Even if they were watching Sypher‚Äôs 100 second delay stream, how would that in any way help someone that was wanting to stream snipe?

I am trying to explain why and why not to and want your opinions too.

There is lots of controversy over why and why not old skins like skull trooper should ever come back to shop.  This is not about battle pass skins like black night which will never come back.

The skull trooper tends to be one of the most wanted skin. Is it because it‚Äôs a cool skin? Is it because it‚Äôs rare? Personally I don‚Äôt like the skin but I wonder why other people do. 

If the hype for the skin comes from it‚Äôs rarity, it completely contradicts the argument of why people want it to come back. You can‚Äôt like the skin because it‚Äôs rare and want it to come back which will completely take that rarity away.

First of all, the skin is not coming back or only being available to people who made an account during X month or X day. Epic is not going to separate there customers over what they can purchase because of there account creation date. Stop asking for this it‚Äôs not going to happen.

So why shouldn‚Äôt they bring the skins back? Being true to there OG players who supported them when he game came out? Bringing out the skin would devalue it as it won‚Äôt be worth rarity wise and would anger those who have the skin and bought it at the early days. Keep rare skins rare right? This might be far fetched but you could say that keeping the skull trooper rare ironically and indirectly makes epic money. Let‚Äôs say people see this skin as OG and cool because it‚Äôs rare, if they look ahead of time this my urge them to buy seasonal skins like Christmas or valentine skins so they can have the rare OG skin months from now. This would be very popular to people who value rarity such as myself. The downside is that this viewpoint has been somewhat torn apart after skins such as love ranged has been in shop 5+ times.

Why bring back Halloween / rare skins? This is kind of obvious but there is a huge hype for skins like skull trooper, bringing it back will no doubt make epic tons of money and make a lot of people happy to get there hands on this skin. Will more people be happy than the people that were angered by this? Is it right to get anyone angry over something like this? There is a market for OG skins and items in fortnite. People sell their accounts for a lot of money and his is bannable by epic. While this leads to scams it also leads to epic yet again indirectly losing money. Why put money into vbucks when you can just buy an account with skull trooper from some guy online. Releasing old rare skins will stop this bannable account selling market but this would also mean no shop skins would be limited time. Accounts with battle pass skins would still be sold though. Try to look at this from epics POV or a businesses POV. $$$

I think the pros to re releasing the skull trooper outweigh the cons. I‚Äôm trying to be non biased here as possible to showing the pros and cons.

If you want my opinion though I think all seasonal skins like Halloween, Christmas, valentines etc should come out during those seasons and then never again. What are your thoughts on my explanation and this rare skin problem. ",FortNiteBR

Shotguns... shotguns seem to be the only weapon anybody ever uses anymore, if I don‚Äôt pick up a shotgun in the first few minutes of a game I know I‚Äôm going to be at a distinct disadvantage in any situation.

Video games need balance, you need every single weapon to be viable in almost every situation, so that people will actually use them to some success.

The fact that shotguns are the only weapon that is used by 99% of the playerbase and that I‚Äôm handicapping myself for not picking one up, is completely backwards and wrong.

Also double pumping is no where near as bad as it was, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more skill based now and it actually requires practice so that‚Äôs not really an issue.

Since the addition of the Heavy Shotgun, I have felt it was under powered, and so has most of the community. Although it may have increased range, and it may be more accurate, a legendary or epic shotgun to the head from close range should be enough to kill someone 1st try. Now, some people may think that's overpowered because the Tactical shotgun does not kill people in 1 shot (full shield + health). But, the Heavy is only found in chests, and only has epic/legendary rarities. We have seen many streamers pick up a green (what used to be white) pump shotgun, over a legendary shotgun. As for the epic rarity, 73 to the body is quite low considering a green pump does 90. 
It also does not have the speed of a tactical, and is slower than most people think. People may disagree with me, but a shotgun that is only rarely found in chests, should be able to do more damage. However, the heavy does have some things going for it. It has a very low pickup(?) time (it comes out faster than pump is what i mean), it has a better bullet spread, and it has increased range.

I have been in fights where i will land 2-4 shots with a heavy, and get one shotted by a pump.

We have seen you go both ways in this situation, where you vaulted the crossbow for its low damage percentages compared to the Hunting Rifle and Bolt-Action, but we have also seen you buff up weapons like the Suppressed SMG.

Vault it or buff it, but change must be done.

You guys brought down close quarters mode for legitimately no reason, ""omg sky bases man everyone's camping..."" that aspect of the mode was so much fun man, you have 4 teams way up at the top of the playable map you have increased material gain and they litterally can't snipe you, you have the ability to just build straight up and have an awesome aerial fight with so many jetpacks there's no excuse not to have one. But some sweaty kid decided it was too much work and came to reddit so he could cry to the devs, and epic trying to listen to the community falls for these antics so because the loud minority doesn't like it I don't get to play it anymore.... 


Okay so that wasn't the biggest deal ever hopefully they realize the bases were a fun part of the mode and don't just listen to the loud minority on every issue.

My suggestion is make the storm do a certain amount of damage to player-built structures, only for this gamemode.

For example, the rate of damage could be similar to someone who is knocked, 2 per second. This would mean that it wouldnt affect building in the storm, unless you are there for extended periods of time and all sky bases will be naturally knocked down. Just a suggestion but I think that it ticks all the boxes",FortNiteBR

I have full health and shield but will get one pumped, numerous times during shotgun fights a hit marker will register, but NO damage will be given. The lag is horrendous, stuttering, the game just feels so off. Building feels super delayed on builder pro, and the desync is a whole other issue. A few games ago during a shotgun battle I totally missed the person by about 180 degrees, but yet it did almost 70 damage to him, a clear case of desync.

I played 100 Solo Matches in a row dropping at the Moisty Mire and recorded additional statistics. 

**Here is a link to the google doc:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BoWt_Zvxvt0v2ASTKrJ_JGBNXBcMYNoPgDzf0D6qR9M/edit?usp=sharing

**Here are my results:**
22 Wins
2.05 KD Ratio
41 Top 3 Finishes
13.74 Average Finish
Other players landed at Moisty 66% of the time
The first circle landed within the Moisty Mire 20% of the time
7 Trap Kills
5 Llamas found
I landed specifically at that far back cabin in the SE corner 88% of the time

**I was killed 78 times by:**
46% Shotgun (36 times)
18% AR (Scar,Burst, Regular, 14 times)
12% Rockets (Two times I killed myself, 9 times)
8% Snipe (6 times)

4% SMG (3 times)
3% Storm (2 times)
1% Trap (1 time)
1% Pistol (1 time)
1% LMG (1 time)
1% Fall Death (1 time)

**Time of day irl I played:**
63% Morning
14% Day
23% Night
I started this on 4/20/18 and Completed it on 5/27/18.

**Season 3 and Season 4 Map Change**
Season 4 started 43 games into this process and the Moisty Mire changed dramatically with the addition of the Movie Set. 

This caused a 25% spike in players landing at Moisty, but otherwise my KD and Win rate wasn't changed much. Surprisingly they slightly improved.

Season 3: 21% Win Rate, KD 2.0, 53.4% Other Players Landing at Moisty 
Season 4: 23% Win Rate, KD 2.1, 75.4% Other Players Landing at Moisty 

**A few notes and conclusions:**
It's important to note I'm on PS4, I'm sorry master race if this taints the data pool. 
I only counted standard solo matches, no LTM's. No Thanos Dubs.

I was actually surprised I was able to get to a 22% win rate. My pal put the over/under at 19.5 based on his estimation of how well I was playing at the time. I reached 20 wins around game 90... Pressure was mounting to beat that 19.5 mark. 

I'm an 11% win rate lifetime across all modes with 363 Wins and a 1.56 KD. I'm an ok player, but, I'm no Ninja or Daequan. 22% win rate seemed like an impossibility only a few months ago.

**""The Excuse Log""**
I found tracking these stats and setting a win goal extremely useful in improving my gameplay over time. I made notes why I died (or won) along the way. This is now known as the excuse log by my buddies. THIS WAS SO USEFUL. It allowed me to rethink my mechanics and strats and late game. Asking myself why I died and recording it may be the most useful thing I found in all of this. For me, I found I gave up my high ground or pushed in terrible spots way too much. Why

**My Jerry Springer Final Thoughts**
When I started this game at around Thanksgiving in season 1, I WAS VERY VERY VERY BAD. I played shooters my whole life, Halo, BF, COD, but the building and strategy in this game just took time to learn. I'd say I didn't feel ""good"" until season 3 or about 1200 games played. If you're looking to improve, playing a lot of games and watching a lot of streamers I think is the best way to get better. If you're not seeing improvements fast enough, something like this might help. There are reasons for why you lost other than just being outplayed. Decisions making in this game can beat better shooting mechanics at a high rate.

After going back to playing just one game of regular squads, we realized how much fun and how much better solid gold is. 

1. You don‚Äôt have to worry about getting pumped for 250 by an opponent while your pump lands for only 9. 

2. Everyone you encounter has essentially the same loadout as you, other than maybe a launcher or some sort. 

3. Solid Gold in our opinions let you play far more aggressively thanks to the previous 2 points, and this in turn helps you with learning how to build. Not to mention the increase in materials. 

4. It‚Äôs a far more action filled and fast paced game than the original squad mode. Especially when the final circle is around dusty divot. We had a game where probably 4-5 squads were all fighting it out and we all had equal loadouts with tons of mats. This wouldn‚Äôt ever happen in the regular squads because half of the people in the fight wouldn‚Äôt have any weapons worth a shit

I loved the snipers only mode and blitz. But imo nothing compared to the solid gold mode. Till next time my sweet friend. ",FortNiteBR

Turns out the patch is coming on June 1st. I think so because there are pictures of people refunding skins and the customer support said that the self-refund feature will be hitting the game June 1st. So it would be logical to think the whole patch comes out June 1st. With the Playground LTM also.

there's got to be a way it can be done to where you can just tap the button or at least decrease the time. The updates they've had for building on consoles have been amazing, but editing is the one thing that feels really slow and clunky

If you're in an intense build battle and you try to edit your build, a lot of times you will not hold it long enough, causing you to just go into build mode, which makes you restart the whole process. It will take like 5 seconds to make your edit if this happens. In that time you might as well just break down the wall with your pickaxe if that's what you were trying to do

I'd be cool with having the edit mapped to a button on the D-pad even.

edit: just to clarify, I'm talking about making changes only to the way you enter edit mode. I'm not suggesting any changes to the actual editing of your builds

edit 2: after thinking on it a while, I think the easiest option without making too many changes to any controller layouts, is to move the squad comms to the emote scroll wheel, and use right d-pad to edit. They already have it so you can scroll through all your emotes, so why not just add squad comms to that scroll wheel? I thought it could work with edit on left d pad, but that's the button you use to change materials on builder pro",FortNiteBR

- Bloom is reduced to its minimum. When I shoot I feel like I'm actually hitting someone the majority of the time (even if I'm only hitting 25%). Seeing all the damage numbers pop up makes me feel good. Shooting a white AR and hitting twice in a clip does not make me feel good.

- Shotguns are virtually gone. Yes, legendary heavy shotguns still exist, but they're so few and far between I don't even care when someone kills me with it. 

The lack of shotguns changes the entire mechanics of Fortnite, and IMO for the better. In regular mode anyone at any time can build to force a shotgun battle. Doesn't matter if you're on the highest mountain and they're on the bottom, if they want to go shotgun to shotgun with you they will.

Yes, people can still build in this mode, but they build for overall  positioning to be able to shoot their scars at an advantage. This is so much more refreshing because you feel like you're actually interacting with the player AND the game, not just the inevitable pump pump kill or dead.

- More materials and launch pads. This quickens the pace of doing the boring stuff. Hitting trees and running to the circle are okay, but making it faster is always welcomed.

- It's for casuals. I rarely see tryhards in this mode. You know who I'm talking about, the former John Wicks going crazy 24/7, and that's all because of the lack of shotguns. Shotguns are so ingrained in a hardcore player's mind that they can't even begin to imagine functioning without one. So they avoid Solid Gold mode and leave us casuals who play for fun in peace.

- You start the game off with a bang. Doesn't matter what gold item I see while landing, I feel like I have a chance to survive. Even if it's a silenced pistol or a sniper rifle, I feel as though if I die it's my own fault. Compare that to finding a green assault rifle and someone lands near you and they find a pump, GG.

- All the FUN items are still in the game mode. I'm talking boogie bombs, C4, impulse grenades. Things you don't normally use in the main game mode, but are hilarious to use here. People always forget C4 exists in this game mode and I actually can kill someone with it. In the main game I would never pick it up because A) no room in my inventory and B) it sucks versus shotguns.

- Fast healing. There's so many chug jugs that you're almost always either at 200 health or dead. It just feels good being at 200 health, like you can take on the world.

- Everything is designed to make you feel good. Everything's shiny gold, the accuracy boost makes you feel like you can hit anyone, 200 health feels empowering, the sound of the scar and famas are so much better, starting the game with a weapon that can win you the game, not having to worry about getting pump shotgunned in the face.

It just feels right.",FortNiteBR

(Tl:dr at bottom)
1- Repetitiveness: The game hasn‚Äôt been out for long but it feels like everything changed. I started playing a month or so into the free release and I sucked so bad. However, when I hear the ‚Äúreeeeeear‚Äù noise getting out of the bus and the old theme music (ah so nostalgic) I would get so giddy. I felt like someone in a small community. Now it‚Äôs boring to go and play a round (again, at least for me) 
2- Players: Back then everyone pretty much sucked and there was no building. Now there are tryhards that build sky castles when they hear a smg shot and John Wicks that will pull up on you and headshot you with a pump. It has turned from a chill game where you can sit with music plugged into one ear but now if you aren‚Äôt sitting there with so much attention your get obliterated. I don‚Äôt think the developers are making the best decisions either. I know this game isn‚Äôt exactly realistic but jet packs? Hop rocks? Now shopping carts you can ride?
3- Community: When I first starting playing no one else I knew played. I would recommend people the game and I would see Snapchat stories of people getting it. Same with Instagram and Twitter. Cool, right? Nah. This game has taken over social media by STORM. Every boys‚Äô and some girls‚Äô social media is littered with posts of their wins. No. One. Cares. Just by following friends all I see on my homepages are clickbait Fortnite videos/ pictures. Reddit is a pretty good part of the community. But if you look at Instagram it‚Äôs like a ton of nine year olds bragging and dumb stuff like that. 
I feel like even though the competitive video game scene is getting larger, the game right now is at its zenith and will continue to slowly lose players.

The new Twitch skin has a bit more camouflage and blends in a bit more with the lush environment. I don't think it makes too much a difference, but I feel like it may be ever so slightly better for hiding, especially with a bush.

Anyway, the ""thing"" I'm complaining about is the accuracy from close range, I have been killed SO MANY times because I missed almost all of my AR shots on close range.

It happens a lot, even with a blue AR, or a scar.

I don't have any clip to show, but I legit hit 99 with a pump on someone then he shot me from 200HP to 45 because none of my scar shots landed on him ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Did anything change in the last few days or could I be looking at a controller issue? I've taken lots of breaks from the game and come back and played well before.",FortNiteBR

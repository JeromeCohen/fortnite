It’s not fun making it to the end using all your various skills building, shotgunning, outmaneuvering just to get into a never ending explosive cluster fu** at the end. 


I had a game on my stream where a guy shot rockets at me for 4 mins straight. Went back and counted 89 freakin rockets.....that’s unacceptable. Couldn’t maneuver cause his teammate was sitting there with a scar and it was just peppering me with first shot accuracy if my dick happened to hang out around a corner.

TL:DR Explosives are fine early game because they take awhile to accumulate. However late game when someone has 80+ its ridiculous. Cap the amount you can hold to 15-20. ",FortNiteBR

You got the Cronus Shuffle, where he does some super speed sexy footwork then does a break dance style headspin in super slow mo, 

You got the Zeus WarAxe which is just a crackling lightning bolt,

You got Poseidons surfs up dance where he calls in a wave of water and surfs that bitch,

You got the Medusa skin complete with independently moving snakes for hair,

You got mf Hercules out this bitch wearing a stylish Chimera-head cloak.

I could go on. Point is though, this is totally achievable. Greek mythology is already written, so not much creative work for epic to have to do, the ideas are already flowing. Sprites don't take much imagination we all think of the same skin when I say ""tier 100 Hades"". I know you are picturing that sexy motherfucker. Can we make this happen?",FortNiteBR

My lil bro came over today, and hes a console player. I plugged my controller in to my PC, and i played on my Laptop with him.

He absolutley shit on the PC players while using a controller, and i kept peforming poorly as usual.

Is there really THAT big of a gap between the two? Especially with the recent changes, my brother was building better than me and killing enemies easily, i find it hard to see the massive gap everyone always talks about.

I realise it will be a learning process to start again with a controller but i think i will prefer it, especially as its more laid back, you can sit back in your chair or on the couch, idk, maybe im wrong.

Also is a Scuf controller with paddles worth the cost if im going to commit to controller?",FortNiteBR

I can guarantee you that they have not used any sort of hacks or something similar they mostly play squad with 4 people , the way i can guarantee is cause we play at an internet caffe and one of the banned players is the owner of the internet caffe and he is there almost all the time , he does not allow 3rd party software to be installed

I'm Whackjob from KSP, and I thought I'd do a little quick personal review.  What follows are my initial impressions.  I submit this, not to instruct, as I seriously doubt that I have any shred of wisdom you lot haven't already prechewed thoroughly, but in the vain hopes I may briefly entertain, or give a fleeting sense of levity, if by technicality only.

So I find the game and I downloaded it.  Fired it up, let it pick the settings... and... all ready I have no idea what I'm doing.  I divine that I need to do the battle royale bit, and there I am on a screen with a character.  How do I design my char?  Male or female, hair, clothes, et cetera?  Okay, looks like unless I buy something, it's totally random.  That's fine.  I can't change guns or pickaxe or anything.  I think I have to unlock things.  After rubbernecking some menus in a farcical attempt to divine their purpose, I figure out how to open a match.  

I should mention at this point that I'm going in to all of this wholly blind.  I have not played fortnite of any flavor, I know vaguely about the last-man-standing gametype all the rage these days, and I knew the vague SuperMutant strategy.  ""Kill.  Loot.  Return.""

Match freaking one is a go.  First, I spawn on some terrain and there's people and guns everywhere.  But you can't hurt anyone.  It seems to be some sort of prematch scamper mode.  So I scamper.  In mere moments, we're all on the dirgible bus, and I'm already licking the windows.  The world and everything I'm seeing is already beautiful.  The bus timer stops, and players gush out the back in a fine colonic spray.  I wait a bit, launch, and I decide to land somewhere away away. 

Now, I should tell you fairly early out of the gate that I am old.  I grew up playing Wolfenstien 3D.  The marvel of my time was dialing in to a bulletin board and downloading a bootleg copy of *Prince of Persia*.  Now, I'm not 40, okay, but I can throw a rock and hit it from where I'm standing.

So I find some small isolated structures, and the occasional box under a tree.  I get a few weapons, and most importantly I think, a sniper rifle and some ammunition.  I go roving.  I've played shooters before, even ones with a lot of open world.  Remember *Delta Force*?  The first one?  Right.  I'm sector-scanning so nobody gets the drop on me, and I'm staying below the military crest of hills as I travel.  For the first span of time, I see nobody.  The storm shrinks once, and about to twice, when I see my first somebody.  Stairs reach up into empty space, and I see some Dudebro plinking from the top of it.  I grab my rifle, find a defensible defilade, and fire.  

I watch in horror as the bullet sensibly drops.  Of course it should.  My quarry fires back and I am dead.  Someone else scampers along shortly and what loot I had is now their loot.  I take the opportunity to watch the kill camera, and follow my executioner around a bit as they do their thing.

Okay, so building stuff.  I didn't even think about it, really, but this guy, he's making structures appear out of thin air.  I took that to mean that you just have to place them, and they'll build themselves.  That's going to take a lot of practice.  The hopping, leaping, skipstepping, and 475 degree noscopes are a thing I can already do.  Not well, I'm not gonna lie to you, but I can put up a fairly reasonable facsimile of those things most of the time on demand.  But anyway, match one, done, zero kills.

Round two, I figure, I'll go right into a town, into the thick of it, and get right into the meat of things, the hardest way possible.  I run inside a house that had four people land next to.  I run in and start to open a box.  Next thing I know, suddenly it's the Ford Theatre, and I'm Lincoln.  Round two, zero kills.

Round three I land inside another town, get a couple weapons, shoot at and scare two people, then decide that they have better long ranged weapons than I do.  I ran inside a building, thinking my shotgun would give me an advantage at close range combat.  That close range which was immediately forfeit as my two persuers decide to paste the building with a rocket.  Suddenly I'm in a dollhouse and I'm staring a malevolent five-year old with scissors and bad judgement *right in the face*.  Their long range fire laughs at my shotgun, and I'm at match three, zero kills.

Match four starts and this time I pick an intermediate site.  It looks like three hangars, all together.  I find a machine pistol.  I hear movement behind me, and I open fire.  Dudebro hops and fires his shotgun a few times, but his aim is somehow worse than mine.  I score a kill.  I pick up what appeared to be some sort of mana potion before someone else comes along, also with a shotgun, but lacking my poor aim.  End of match four, one kill.

Match five through seven kind of blur in my mind, it was late in the AM, and I had cats to feed at five, before going to sleep.  But I do remember two sniper rifle battles I had at a lake, losing both.

So the end result was, seven matches, one kill.  I'm terrible, ya'll.  I think this was the first time I had so much fun while simultaneously doing exceptionally poorly.  I'll do better with some practice, I'm sure I will.  But, I think I have to admit to myself also, that I'm getting old, and I'm not as sharp and quick as I once was.  But that's fine.  I'll be here for some time, lurking, reading, learning.

But, maaan.  This game sure gets the blood pumping, eh?",FortNiteBR

It should be a testament to some really high skilled players and I find it’s mostly people who bought their way to it or their average. 

However, the High Octane glider, which is achieved with a special level 100 challenge list, is a good example of how the next level 100 skin should function. It’ll work like this:

Players can buy the tiers as per usual, but once you get to level 100, you have to do a special set of challenges to actually unlock the skin. 

Challenges such as:

-Games played 
-Kills
-Victories (something like 20, nothing crazy ridiculous but you still need to grind) 

And just some other generic challenges that are a testament to lots of time played and high skill. That way you don’t get a bunch of wallet warriors who are using it. ",FortNiteBR

In basically all ESPORTS games, the playing field is even for all players. This means if you put in the effort and time practicing, you will eventually be able to beat other teams / players, because well... you have more skill than them. Not better RNG.

In Fortnite and every other Battle Royale game, the playing field is never even. Luck plays a **huge** part in whether or not you will kill your opponent and win the game. 

You could be the best pro player in the world, but if you get nothing but Silenced SMG's and Bandages while your opponent 10 meters away finds a Scar, It's pretty obvious who is going to win the fight...

The fix for this is simple: For Fortnite ESPORTS to be successful, **all factors of RNG Must be eliminated.**

This simply just means give every player the same weapons / materials at the start. Then, skill would be everything, and all of those hours spent on training / practice will come to use.",FortNiteBR

The main reason I like 50v50 is because the building battles are epic, where I don't have to spend 15 minutes farming wood.

It's a video series in which relative noobs try to play Fortnite BR for 14 straight days.

If you don't want to watch, here's the gist of it...

They're on Day 12 right now and for the past 12 days, they've gotten crushed for 15+ hours of playing.  Needless to say, they aren't in love with the game like we are because people generally don't have fun while getting their **** pushed in.

Here's the takeaway that Epic needs to recognize...

Epic has to create a matchmaking system that allows crappy players to be queued in the same match.   New players will have a lot more fun if they're getting into a few successful skirmishes on a semi consistent basis.",FortNiteBR

Why are they even in the game, if all they do is creating unfair fights you don't even get rewarded for winning?

Back in December/January when 50v50 first came out, I was thrilled. The idea of what essentially was a war in Fortnite was spectacular, and I only played that mode while it was available. So when I heard they were bringing back 50v50, I was excited. Very excited. But as I played the new version, there was something off, something I couldn’t quite place. It wasn’t until my last match that I figured it out.
Teamwork.

In the old 50v50, it was simple: land in an area, group up with those around you, and try to stay alive, there was a sense of camaraderie, of friendship. You picked up your teammates, traded weapons, and stuck with who you landed with ‘til the very end. The new version however, is not that. It almost always follows a simple formula:
1. Land somewhere and loot until there’s nothing.
2. Run for 2-3 minutes to the point.
3. Get into skirmishes that may or may not end you, despite having (usually) 20+ friendlies around you.
4. Either have 20+ people chase &lt;10 people, or be one of the &lt;10 people.

While this can make some fun moments, it’s the attitude of players that ruins it. Need a loot crate? Instead of waiting, just find one that’s freshly landed and impulse grenade everyone trying to open it. Saw a guy get a good gun? Watch him get downed, and then crawl towards you while you do the Take the L dance. I had eight kills once, and I crawled towards a guy. 

The saddest part of this new version is that no amount of changing the mode will fix it. No rule will change people’s inconsiderate attitudes. No v3 will fix the lack of teamwork. Hell, it’s probably not even the new version’s fault, but rather the expanded player base is filled with more jerks.

TL;DR: Lack of teamwork has ruined 50v50, as everyone plays by themselves, for themselves.",FortNiteBR

Currently Fortnite has a mix of casual and competitive players. With there being many more casual players than competitive. I think that there should be separate ranked modes for each gamemode ( solo,duo,squads ). When you reach a new rank, you unlock a new skin that you can only have by being at that rank or higher. So when you are in a casual game nonranked players will be able to identify the skill of a player based on their skin. The ranked system should have an algorithm similar to that of the trn rating system. There should be a skill based matching system in place aswell ( pairing up with players of the sane skill level). If skill based matching is in play, there will be more interesting fights because pro players will always be facing each other. Imagine Ninja, Myth, Sypher, Daequan etc, clashing every few games. I think that a ranked system will give players another motive to play the game and grind the ranks.

What do you guys think about ranked competitive?

Reddit was right about a few things.   The Guided Rocket Launcher (GRL) was OP.  It was way too effective at killing people at relatively safe distances.  Reddit was also right saying the counter to the GRL was not fun.  Boxing yourself up in a 1x1 while your enemies flank and rush you was not enjoyable.

That's where Reddit stopped being right.

The GRL was by far, the most interesting and fun item (not just weapon) in the game.  The variety of uses it gave the player was absurd.  Let us list a few off...

1.  You could rocket ride yourself, your teammates, and in some small instances, your down but not out teammates to a variety of locations.  Amazing.

2.  You could scout areas otherwise impossible.

3.  You could fake enemies into boxing up, while you detach and run where you want for a few seconds.

4.  You could bait players by shooting it, detaching, and watch players rush you.  Why would they rush you?  Because they want that weapon.

This thing was unbelievable in terms of design (not balance).

Additionally, the thing was a blast to play against as long as you didn't feel the need to box yourself up, which admittedly happened too often.  Let us count the ways..

1.  Rushing a Guided Rocket user while he was out flying his toy was an absolute rush.

2.  Watching a Guided Rocket fly in the distance felt like a scene from Jurassic Park.  Does it see me?  Where's it going?  Should I hide?

3.  Shooting a Guided Rocket down was satisfying.  

The only thing not satisfying about the GRL was the fact that boxing yourself up was all too often the correct play to make.  A play that is almost by definition, not fun.

So Epic, I hear Redditors say ""I hope we never get that thing back"".  I scoff at those people and I hope you do as well.  Those people don't know brilliant design if it hit them in the face. 

Epic, bring that thing back as soon as possible.   Just make sure you bring it back balanced.  It was way too fun when it was working the way it was intended.

Possible Solutions:  

1)  Make the GRL like the Impulse Grenades.  It has X number of uses and then it's ""used up"".  

2)  Reduce HP of the GRL to 75hp, make it 10% slower, and reduce its turn radius by a bit.

3)  Limits the amount of rockets players can carry to 15 maximum.

4)  Give Guided Rockets a longer smoke trail highlighting the drivers player character to the rest of the enemies in the match.",FortNiteBR

Well, these are the ones that we love to scoff at, and generally make easy pickings for us average/above average players. A higher ranking means that the skin is almost always worn by a noob player

1) Default Skin - No surprise here. We all saw this one coming. It's not to hate on the default skins. Some people don't like spending money on cosmetic items, and that is perfectly fine. But seeing a default skin running across an open field is like finding a 10 dollar bill on the floor. It's a free kill 9 times out of 10. Fortnite is a popular game, and so you constantly have lots of people hopping on for the first time. We've all been there, but man does it feel good to not be there anymore.

2) Rust Lord - If you wear this skin, chances are the only thing you're good at is doing the ""Take the L"" dance in the pregame. Then when the game does start, it's back to the lobby with you. No but seriously, the Rust Lord is a great skin that is unfortunately all too common. 

3) Dark Voyager - Remember when we all wanted to finally get our hands on this skin? We all thought it looked badass and amazing. But then we realized that whoever is wearing it can be seen from 10 miles away on a foggy day. People who wear this skin aren't necessarily noobs per se. They might be quite decent at building and shooting. But the problem is that a lot of the time, they die before the gun fight even begins. Enemies spot them and are able to land devastating blows before they can even react or return fire. And we all know how important it is to get the first shot (or at least, to stay out of people's radar). 

4) Mission Specialist - Whether it's the female skin or the male skin, I have yet to see a pro wearing this ugly, clunky suit. I don't know if wearing this bulky suit increases the hitbox size on your character, but whenever I see a mission specialist walking on a roof of a house, I know that I can add one more kill to my list. 

5) Rogue Agent - I like to call this one the Default Skin Premium™. I'm not gonna lie though, when this skin came out with the ""starter pack"", I immediately ran to get my mom's credit card to cop the outfit and the 600 V-Bucks. But apparently, so did a lot of other people.

1) Skull Trooper - This skin is quite rare. It released well before I began playing (I believe on Halloween). This means that anyone who has this skin has been playing the game for at least 7 months. Every Skull Trooper I've come across has been a beast at building and absolutely destroys with the pump shotgun. 

2) The Black Knight - Again, another older skin (released season 1 or so every player wearing it is basically a veteran). This skin was the John Wick before the John Wick, and it shows.

3) Pink/White Bunny - I don't know why but this guy is always terrifying for me. I've recently gotten very good at the game, so I have been killing more of these bunny skins, but I remember when I would just get absolutely pummeled by these players. I think they embody the suit and just become insanely fast. 

4) Alpine Ski Outfit - It doesn't matter what the flag the wearer is rocking. Any time I see a guy wearing an alpine ski outfit, I make a run for it. These guys love to get the high ground and one shot pump you to the face. 

5) Green Dinosaur (Rex) - I'm not exactly sure why this skin is so rare. I don't know how old it is, but I'm pretty sure it came out at the start of season 3. Nevertheless, I have yet to see a bad Rex player. These guys are master builders and play insanely smart.

6) John Wick - He's lower on the list because as we near the end of the season, this skin is becoming more and more common. But in his prime, John Wick was one scary mofo. I remember having our entire squad get wiped out by a single player. 

7) Elite Agent - I like to call this one the ""pre-John Wick"" skin, because this is the last skin you get before John Wick. I'm not sure why but these guys are incredibly hard to hit. It's like the hit box on this character is smaller than other skins. I've used this skin recently and I've been stacking 7-10 kills each game right out of Tilted/Pleasant. Someone explain pls 

(Honorable Mentions) - Whiplash Skin &amp; Funk Ops - This skin isn't even legendary but for some reason all the wearers I've come across have been insanely good.

If we are taking in terms of games played per win I guess it would be about 1 win per 100 games if only 1/100 people per game can win. The below average players would win less frequently allowing the above average players to win more frequently. I’d say my record is about 1 win per 50 games but considering I’d never seriously played any sort of shooter before so I didn’t get a win in like my first 500 i take that to mean I’m doing alright now with a win coming every 10-20 games 

If we are talking kills per game what would you consider the average standard to be, I’ve been in games where I’ve died in my first fight and ones I’ve won with only 3 kills but then I have games where i can hit 12 kills which isn’t great but again I’ve only just began playing offensive.

My IRL friends don't play this game (my wife and infant baby also don't seem too enthusiastic about it) so thought I'd share it with the reddit! 

There were a couple times that I came in final 5 but always got outplayed at the end.  It's only fitting then that when I realized there is only two of us left, I find myself facing THE final boss for this season... the JOHN WICK!

This John Wick was building very well and outplaying me, I very nervous but good thing I remembered to build and had tons of shield/bandages with me.  We were in an elongated fight for what felt like 15 minutes (probably 45 seconds).  I was running out of heals when the supply dropped in front of me.  I build walls around it and opened it... behold... A LEGENDARY ROCKET LAUNCHER!  I started launching rockets at this John Wick then spamming AR shots at him.  He finally went into the enrage/second phase... he built up and jump-pad towards me (I miss all my shots of him in mid-air) and landed near me.  He built upwards so I just kept shooting at him.  I was at 4hp when one of my bullets finally connected with his head and alas... VICTORY ROYALE!!!!

Thanks to the replay function I went back to enjoy the win all over again then I realized that during the final fight I was completely exposed at the end... next time I will build!

1. I'm not demanding Epic to lower the cost of their skins.

2. If you feel that your money's worth when it comes to these skins, that's great. That's completely cool.

3. I am NOT saying one game is better than another, just using a comparison when it comes to certain cosmetics.


  So in League of Legends, they have skins called 'legendary skins'. They're the second highest tier of skins in that game. These skins (except a few early ones from before Riot upped their standards) offer a new base skin, new animations, new particle effects, and a new voice over. All for $15.

  Yes, Fortnite and League are two completely different games. However, it does seem like Riot put more effort into their $15 skins than Epic does in their $20 skins. 

  So a couple of suggestions to make players more satisfied with their purchases is to add something else along with the skin. Like a loading screen, or a contrail. Maybe even an emote. Literally anything to help justify the $20 price. But that's just how I feel, what do you guys think?

After some looting I open the door to get out of the house and I see you again but you kill me. And then you dance.

No one is your friend, not even your gosh darn teammates. Your teammates will steal your weapons, snatch your shield potions, build above you while you're having a civil fight against a teammate with rock paper scissors for a supply drop and snatch the supply drop.

And oh my fuckkk don't get me started on breaking my ramps n shit. I'm just trying to fucking idk, get up a mountain or some shit? I walk up there next minute I'm downed cause of some special boy who decided it would be funny to break my ramp or impulse me into fucking non-existence.

And then when you DO get downed, no one... not a single person will revive you. I just had a game where I got downed, and like fucking 7 people were around me and not a single one revived me! Jesus christ, if you want my fucking scar to bad go steal a supply drop from someone, not wait for me to die...

I try my best to revive as many people, and help many others out but I just can't outweigh the amount of toxic people myself... 

So yeah... there's my rant, holy shit, I feel a bit better but dayyyum, there's wayyy too many toxic / cancerous players in 50v50.

Epic pls fix.,"**Disclaimer:** *I have posted this a couple of times now so some of you might have already seen it. I'm reposting this because those are bugs that make the gameplay on console feel clunky and less enjoyable, especially the first one that I explain in depth. Furthermore Epic has not listed these bugs on their Trello so they are very likey not aware of them. Hopefully this gets their attention.*


**Bug/ Issue**

Since the addition of builder pro i noticed many inconsistencies regarding building on console.
What happened is that i tried to block some shots by placing down walls. For some reason it didn't do so and i ended up catching those bullets with my face even though i pressed circle and held down R2. 
It actually happens pretty frequently to me, also with other building pieces too. What happens there, is that when i want to select another building piece, the first button press wont't register and it wouldn't let me switch to the building piece i want, i would have to press that button another time to make it work.

Since this is quite an annoying bug and makes the gameplay feel clunky I tried to replicate this and found out that it is really easy to replicate:

**Replication on PS4**

 - Press Circle to enter build mode
 - Press or Hold R2 *immediately/ as fast as possible* after pressing circle 

Normally you should have placed a Wall, but you did not.

*The same goes with selecting/placing other building pieces:*

- Press Circle to enter build mode 
- Press L2 *immediately or as fast as possible* after pressing circle 
- Press L2 again 

Normally you should've now built a set of stairs, which is not the case If you've done the first two steps correctly/ fast enough. Instead you still have walls selected at step 2 and stairs selected at step 3. Thus you would have to add another step to actually place your set of stairs, which should already have been the case in step 3.

**Noticable things while doing these steps**

After doing those steps to replicate the bug over and over again i noticed a couple of things: 

 - if I want to place down a wall, my gun would shoot even after pressing circle. 

 - if I want to select/ place down stairs with L2 (after pressing circle)  sometimes my Screen would zoom in and out quickly  as if I was aiming down sights.

 - if i want to select a floor with R1, the game still registers it as swapping weapons as you can still see that selection slot moving to the right while the selection bar in the HUD gets smaller in order to make space for the build-menu.

**Conclusion/ Explanation**
 
I'm pretty sure you already saw that there is some kind of pattern behind this, but before
I jump to the conclusion I'd like to explain some terms that I'll use to illustrate the problem: 

 - **Build mode**: All the things you do after pressing circle, pretty self-explanatory

 - **Combat mode**: Things you do outside of build mode, for example ads, shooting, switching weapons.

So basically after you press CIRCLE to enter **build mode** there is a *really, really* short delay where your actions are still executed in **combat mode**. 

This also goes hand in hand with an already known issue of the builder pro layout that i'll list at the end of this post: 

 - *selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting*

This problem can be explained with the conclusion that i just made. 
What's causing you to stop sprinting is that you've pressed L2 (which is ADS in **combat-mode**) in that specific time window where your actions are still executed in **Combat mode**. Thus you were aiming down sights for a really short amount of time which was enough to stop your character from sprinting.

Actually looking back at this, maybe this isn't just a builder pro issue. It could be possible that this problem transfers to the other Control schemes, too. 

**Other (known) issues**

So I think we are all aware of the current bugs/issues that the new Builder Pro layout comes with: 

- Selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting. 

- Full-auto weapons will stop firing  when aiming down sights while firing. (Already in their Trello


Finally, i would really appreciate it if you upvote to get this post some attention, so the devs can see it and look into it. 
(I really don't care about internet points, but i do care about bugs getting fixed to guarantee a better experience for everyone.)

Anyways thanks for reading and I'm sorry if anything of this is hard to understand because English isn't my native language heh.

However, most people can't survive it. Surviving tilted towers and landing a high kill game requires insane amount of skill and experience. If you can, I assume this wouldn't even help you because you're already as good or better than me. Anyway, always land near the bus route in areas like Salty, Retail, Greasy, or Pleasant, and remember the route. Avoid the farms, they're trash. Always land on the first floor of a building instead of the roof like most people. Entering the first floor gives you a higher chance of finding a shotgun. Players going for the chest in roofs pray for a heavy which is unlikely. Now that you found a shotgun. Collect mats from the furniture, and listen for a player that may have landed on your roof. Try to wait for him to break in and kill him. Then, walk outside and build to the roof. Now, look around and find your next target. As you move towards  your next target, collect as much wood possible keeping awareness of the surroundings. After clearing your first town, head to the nearest popular town, while always moving towards the next circle. Make sure you make it into the next circle as fast as you can. The best way to rack high kills in the mid game is killing people who rotate in the circle. If you're in the next circle first, you are likely going to get many kills from rotations. Now, you're in the late game. 10-15 people left, and you might have like 7 or 8 kills by now. Just run around the edge of the circle and you will find the majority of the aggressive players. Killing the aggressive players first is priority now. These are the players taking all the kills. Once you have done this, move into the middle where tower and bush campers reside. At this point, there is probably about 6 left now. Let's say you have 15 kills. Obviously, you have to push the towers to get the 20 bomb. But, if you have maybe 10 or 12, and you're just looking to get a high kill game. Then play it safe and make a tower yourself. Wait to see where the circle goes. Hopefully you made your tower in the next circle, which is easy win. If not, good luck. ",FortNiteBR

I spent a good amount of time, fine tuning what they wanted. Everything came out great. He has started streaming a lot so he wants all the boxes, logos, brb screens, and stuff like that. I know my stuff and I liked what I made. After spending all the time doing it, he said never mind and told me he would just get someone else to do it. Do not be that guy because that makes us graphic designers less likely to want to help you guys out.
Here's just a couple tips.

    Things to tell graphic designers to help us make you what you want.


Tell us EXACTLY what you want. Design, colors, themes.


Do not rush us. We will do our best to get it done.


If we are doing it for free, fuck off when you say you want a professional logo. I am not spending hours of my day, making a professional logo that is perfect for you when I get nothing in return.


""Exposure"", does not exist unless you actually have thousands of followers.

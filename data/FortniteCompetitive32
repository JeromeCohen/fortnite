That made me rage pretty hard. Its very weird that alot of people want something to be changed and after its done they will complain even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its not only about one pumping it also happened to redeploy and a few times more. Im aware that Epicgames has to change a lot of things but we (i wont exclude me here) also have to change our mindset. I dont want to say that we have to aDApT to everything but accepting changes etc and looking more into it before complaining would help alot. This is not Fortnite exclusive its common sense these days everyones complaining about everything especially on the Internet.

Trust me if you are more open minded you will be a lot less stressed and the dialogue with others (also epicgames) would be easier. This crying meme mindset wont get us anywhere its one of the reasons gaming and some parts of the internet are still not socially accepted.

Im really interested about your opinion on that and the one pump. I hope it was kind of understandable because english is not my native language. Have a nice day guys and try to be more open. ",FortniteCompetitive

-Deagle and heavy sniper both need a severe nerf to structure damage so that neither can one tap any full built structure(even wood)
-The splash damage and spamability of both rocket and grenade launchers is a joke adding an ammo cap did help a lot but the splash damage needs to be reduced and reload time increased(for the rocket launcher)
-Snipers shouldn’t do more than 175 headshot dmg and only the heavy should do more than 100 body(controversial however having your game ended because someone is camping out of sight for them to just pop out and one tap you from 150m although it does take skill to hit a headshot at that distance everything should have a counter and a sniper headshot does not)
-All snipers and explosives(other than grenades) should only spawn in epic and legendary rarity
-Epic and legendary rarity guns should only be available in supply drops which shouldn’t spawn until the fist zone starts closing in(meaning you can’t get one tapped because someone walks into a house and kamikazes you with a launcher
-The sounds someone makes when using balloons needs to be increased as they are virtually silent 
-every house should spawn a minimum of 1 gun to every 2 possible spawns(eg if a house has ten possible spawns that would be five guaranteed guns)
-Remove any item that takes away a basic gameplay mechanic eg boom box and boogie bomb taking away your ability to build(boogie and boom) and shoot(boogie)
-96 headshot damage on an AR is far too high it should be max 70, with the scar and m16 going down by 10 for each variant.
-Deagle headshot damage should be lowered from 150 to 100 unless the drop off rage is greatly decreased
-Dynamite/stinks and grenades need a reduction in stack size as they are all very spamable and almost impossible to counter in endgame situations(especially stinks)
-Dynamite needs a vault or a big nerf on its damage radius both to players and structures
This wouldn’t make the game perfect however in my opinion it would make it balanced everything has a clear counter(usually building) ",FortniteCompetitive

Players taking shots before their characters visually perform the animations of even pulling out the gun or peeking from behind a wall. You will also see PC players at times ""warp"" as if they are lagging, however there is no ping spike or packet loss, and partners using a PC will not report seeing them lag, only the PS4 user.

--

Then we have Dr Lupo who found out that fire rate is directly related to frames [here](https://twitter.com/DrLupo/status/1087387372147433477). This is something to do with the engine Fortnite uses. This is a HUGE issue as console is capped at 60fps. Meaning people on PC getting higher frames will have a higher fire rate. Also, the nature of this bug means its possible builds, edits, and everything else interacting with the world would also perform better with higher frames. This should not be the case. Everything should be equal and not dependent on frames. 

--

Things like shadows being turned off is also an issue, but the reason for my post is there are unfair advantages that greatly favor PC beyond just aesthetic changes you can make in the game. The fire rate, build speeds, and warping of PC players seems to be a huge issue. Some people associate this with lag, but something tells me processing power and the engine used gives PC a huge advantage, as such, until the game is optimized or fixed, console should not be going up against PC in competitive events.

The current state for Asia servers/Singapore servers is horrible. Almost every match we get 300-500ms ping and this has been happening since Ice Storm event started. I run one of of the largest Asia scrim discords and we cannot scrim due to the inavailibility of servers. It is impossible to play on Europe nowadays with 160ms ping.

  


Almost everyone in the South Asia/South East Asia has been affected by this. This issue has bee present since the first day of the launch of SEA servers but now it has reached it's worst. It is impossible for us Asia players to enjoy this game. Even if you are not in Asia, please bring attention to this issue so Epic can look into it.

During the past 2 weeks, i have been training a lot on my own island where i made a practice course that focuses on shotgun shots. As a target i used the chinese lantern because its about the size of a head and clearly visable.  


I was aware that this item would not trigger aim assist, but like so many of you, my reasoning was: if i can hit targets without aim assist i will be even better without it.... I was so wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

When i started, it was really difficult to hit shots without the aim assist, but by practicing i could notice my aim getting a lot better. Now i hit probably 80+ % of my targets on the first shot. thinking i would have godlike aim with aim assist now, I tried it out ingame and my aim was incredibly off.  


After some investigation and thinking I believe i found the reason for this. Aim assist doesnt just drag your crosshair to the opponent like a magnet, it slows down your aim when your crosshair gets near the target so you can be more precise in the final few pixels to your target. because i was not used to this anymore i shot my shots before my crosshair was on the target, or sometimes even late, because i was overcompensating.   


Conclusion: If you want to practice your aim for console, only use sentries or play team rumble.  


TLDR: playing WITHOUT aim assist will mess with your muscle memory and timing for playing WITH aim assist. don't do it.",FortniteCompetitive

In a game where you're at the mercy of bloom, and where high burst damage is becoming increasingly more valuable, and obtaining high ground over your opponents is key, having a very powerful close range weapon that's easy to use and offers high reward to minimal effort is going to dominate the game. 

If anyone here says they don't die to the pump more than any other weapon in the game, I honestly think they are lying. Whether it's early game or in the top 5.It's always the first gun you want to get when you drop, and it's the one gun in your inventory you're never willing to compromise on. You need a pump (I guess a heavy if you're a savage) in this game, the alternatives just aren't good enough. You don't need an AR, or and SMG, or a Sniper, or Splodes. But 9.9 times out 10, you're running a pump (or heavy).

I find it weird people complain about things like the RPG, but fail to recognize how insanely overused the pump is right now, we need new or equally good alternatives. The damage the pump craps out is just to hard to pass up in the current state of the game. 


TDLR: The pump is insanely strong right now, and basically mandatory to your loadout. There should be more alternatives to close range fighting.

86,F5_MyUsername,1548574239,aka1ig,39,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aka1ig/rpg_there_is_only_one_answer/,1,RPG - There is only one answer,"The RPG must be reengineered in order to keep whatever little integrity in had left in the game. Since it’s original rehaul early last year, a lot has changed in the Fortnite world. For example, deagle and heavy sniper one shot walls. 

The blast radius and splash damage are two independent variables that need to be accounted for when calculating how much damage should be dealt.

 *Just like the shotgun*, the RPG is a weapon that make the most sense when it’s effectivness is based on real time factors, NOT predetermined constants such as Sniper damage.

A shotgun shot from 25 meters away has drop off damage compared to 1 meter that gives the full power. In the same train of thought, a rocket that hits directly on target, putting the enemy in the center of the blast radius, should do maximum damage. Players should be awarded for hitting their targets perfectly with a large, maximum allowable damage amount.

However, a player on the edge of the blast radius, who has created distance between himself and the rocket, should be awarded and only take a percentage of the max damage. 

Rockets currently are wha to effective  And have become the deciding factor in the end of most every game  not based on skill but based on blunt powerand ease of use. Not only does it hit for 115 damage from any range which is crippling during crunch time moving circles , it also obliterates the ability to build, strategically defend, rotate and counter.

If you are 1v1 at the end vs a player evenly skilled as you, the person with the RPG with more rockets is going to win. Bad players use it to win, and good players abuse it to win effortlessly.

Splash damage needs to change. Just because you hit a shot 2 walls  above me and to the right doesn’t mean I should take the same amount of damage as if you shot it underneath my feet. 

This allows players to carelessly and imprecisely spam rockets towards enemies “new builds” and structures, especially during circle movement, without skillfully taking time to aim, calculate, etc

A) players that don’t know how to use it can still easily spam it towards “the giant building there” and get kills/win games. I’ve seen players with 1 kill win these who have .6 K/Ds and 29 lifetime wins. Yeah sure - the “bad players” get beaten / countered the majority of the time. However the 17% of the time that they DO end up killing you/winning is about 16% higher than if they didn’t have rockets.

GOOD players?! Good. Fkn. Luck. Especially if they’re a team and coordinated.. talk about calculating aim and timing being skillful, give 2 tip teir scrim streamers in duos a deagle and rocket ... watch them perfectly coordinate breaking opponents walls as soon as the rocket in the air is about to hit. 

It’s really not even that hard... but it shouldn’t be possible in the first place. .  

team A is on a mountain ledge on the 5th circle and team B is below them. Team B just finished killing team C, and while going to collect loot needed (heals and mats), team A unloads a rain of terror, spamming RPG shots downwards toward the rotating enemies pile of loot. 

Team B immediately uses steel and starts boxing up as many as possible , working towards the loot. The barrage stops for momemet as team A tries spamming AR/snipes. This allows Team B to situate themselves and  They start taking shields/meds/campfires. Before completion the next barrage of fire is screaming down upon them - 2 fires instant destroyed. A big shield didn’t get finished and had to be reset and the only item beneficial at this time would be a rift; because there is NO way to counter attack this

By the time you are able to block
The rockets, build in place and try to get shots back up, another rocket is close enough to KILL YOU with ridiculous splash damage. You SEE the rocket is 10
Feet away going to hit a TREE! Yet you are forced to stop your counter attack and turtle bc blast radius and splash damage unethically deals as much damage equal as being directly hit. Soon, your ability to keep re-boxing yourself so quickly is gone as the other team’s rocket. Slipped in your builds , hitting the back of some wall you didn’t even know was there , turbo built in the frenzy .

You spectate team A) 2 kills, both holding 2 explosives each and ask yourself “what could I have done better?” Nothing. The gun is broken. 

I’m not even going to pretend like removing the item is even a possibility for Epic - it’s staying. With that said , can we please modify this weapon to reflect the state of the present game in an ever evolving meta. 

1) Blast Radius - Damage reduction: varying  damage should be dealt modified for each independent shot. Closer, more precise rockets that are direct hits deal max damage. “Medium” distance 70-90% and “edge of the blast” damage 50-60%. Etc. I’m pulling these out my ass but hey if y’all let US TEST THESE THINGS (being able to modify weapon damage) in Creative! We could give you valuable feedback


2) splash damage - this refers to RPG hitting the wall behind you and since you’re close, you AND the wall take max damage. Look, Splash is a great concept but it needs to be reworked.  I haven’t tested it enough to know the exact details but there’s way too many times tha players aren’t remotely close enough to the impact to receive damage.

3) Let is shoot rockets out of the air with snipes/ARs. Instead of letting them fly 350 meters all the way to your base, being forced to burn hundreds of materials and exposed to 3rd parties... let us destroy explosives being used at far distance with great aim. If it’s within 50ish meters there will be no way, but at 100+ the perfect shot could potentially stop your team from absorbing the hit - this let’s clutch skillful plays become a counter to the otherwise perfect offensive weapon. 

4) “Cool down time” - what about, if a player fires a certain amount, let’s say 5, of rockets in a row (period of time like 5 rockets in 9’ seconds) the gun, much like a turret , has to “cool down” and you must wait 10-15 seconds until use again. It works for the mini gun/turret... why not apply the same concept to RPG? They both do the same thing - put relentless pressure upon defenders building, burning 100s of mats in secs, not giving them the time or space to assess the situation, reposition, rotate, heal, etc.

5) add an “anti rocket” weapon. Let us pick up a bubble shield from halo or a “ballast proof vest” that negates or at least limits the damage taken from splodes. Dumb? Maybe? Probable? Not likely ... do I think this could help limit the rpg spam ? God I hope so ... ITS SO BAD !!!

The game Fortnite is still technically in early access which is why even though I don’t like it, I’m fine with Epic adding/vaulting items every major update or so and I completely understand why the community makes a big deal of it every time a new item or mechanic gets added but that has more to do with Epic’s lack of communication about state of development of the game and the fact that they haven’t talked about when the game will no longer be in early access.
This is a discussion that always comes up in fully released games specially a year or two after they’ve been out which is why it’s so terrifying in Fortnite’s case because the power creep has been a thing before the game is even officially released!
I think the best example I could give is the Sniper Rifle. In one and a half year we have went from having the semi-automatic sniper not even able to one shot someone and the bolt sniper which had the highest burst damage of 200+ to the head and 110 body shot to having a heavy sniper that breaks anything in one shot, deals 150 body shot damage and 200+ headshot damage. We also now have the silent sniper which is basically the bolt but makes way less noise. As a result the semi-automatic sniper became so irrelevant that it was vaulted and now many believe the hunting rifle is also lacking in power compared to the other snipers and even the Heavy Assault rifle(since a AK headshot is worth more than a hunting rifle body shot) and should be vaulted as well.
Same goes for shotguns, back in the day there were 4 tactical shotguns and two pumps but in the past year and a half 6 new shotguns were added all either Epic or Legendary with the latest one overshadowing every other shotgun in the game.
It’s the same story with Assault Rifles. The Famas only came in Epic and Legendary variants basically being better bursts, two new Scars and 3 new Heavy ones that can almost 2 shot anyone.
Correct me if I’m wrong but ever since the game became available, only Epic+ weapons have been added with the exception of the Blue AK and two hunting rifles and ALL of the new weapons added have been so strong compare to what there already was that in some cases old ones became more common with the SAME stats like the Bolt Sniper now available as a Rare item capable to one shot a player with 200hp.
Another extreme example is of course the deagle compared to it’s old self which I won’t get into. 
I think more people need to be talking about power creep and burst damage creep. A real discussion should be held around rarities and lower tier weapons place in the game because as of now some items are too strong and some too weak and the answer is not to get rid of weak items.",FortniteCompetitive

Next is the computers they used, I have no idea what was in them, but even though they never actually dipped below 120fps, they was horrible, it actually felt like the game was capped at 30fps and I honestly can’t tell why. There was also 20-40 ping for what should have been a LAN even, that plus the sluggish computers made stuff like even farming a horrible experience. 

The equipment for kb/m was very meh, the G pro hero is a decent mouse, but if you haven’t used it prior it’s very hard to get used to. The Corsair mm100 is a ridiculously tiny mousepad but at least they keyboard was good. 
For controller players, I feel so sorry. Many of them had their controller straight up disconnect in the middle of a fight, or just spin out randomly, just to be told “oh bad luck” by the staff, one of the guys said his controller cut out four times before he even landed, and it took three replacements just to get a working one. 

Now, on to the actual qualifiers, once you log in, you aren’t given any time to warm up or practice, you just put your game code in and after ten minutes of waiting you’re in. I really think the way they chose the 500 people in the qualifiers needed to be different, having a first come first serve approach lead to a lot of not so competitive players compete, which really ruins it for actual competitive players who have practiced for months. I myself ended up dying because a guy had I guess given up and was just hiding in zone, I had to rotate late, but he was just chilling on 30 hp, waiting in zone and one pumped me, only to immediately die. People like that shouldn’t be allowed in huge competitions, he threw his game and ruined my chance to qualify just for one kill. 

There is a lot more I could go about, and anyone else who went, please feel free to share your problems, or even better share what went right for you. 

Here are just some small suggestions that could’ve made this a much better event, 

• let us use custom video settings, native res sure, but high shadows, anti aliasing etc makes the game run like crap and feels horrible for us. 

• make sure your game actually runs well and feels smooth before people compete

• let us warm up before hand, even a little bit

• more transparency about who goes where as when, everyone was kinda anxiously waiting around to see if they would be called down to wait

• have a proper event to pick the top 500 players, not just who can fill out a forum the quickest, this lead to not actually having many pro players in the qualifiers or finals

If anyone actually read all of this thank you, if you have any questions I’ll try to answer them. ",FortniteCompetitive

 THIS IS JUST MY OPINION PLEASE DON'T GET TRIGGERED

&amp;#x200B;

The pump shotgun is too powerful in my opinion. The current state of it having 95 body shot for uncommon (an outstanding 37% for floor drops) it is baffling to see the power of it in just body shot. I want the shotgun to have a nerf to the base damage \*BUT\* increase the headshot damage to the original 2.5 times. 80 for green base and 85 for blue base would leave a headshot of 200 for green but 212.5 for blue (we can leave the gold and purple pumps as it is. No crazy headshot multipliers.) I see this as being more ideal but we also need more damage drop off. At a range of 1 block building unit, the damage should drop to 2/3 the normal amount (standing end to end). This should also be applied to the new pumps for balancing. What do you guys think? I think this will make the pump amazing still but also allow other shotguns to compete as you won't be one tapped in the toe by a guy with a blue pump (astonishing 13% drop rate!).",FortniteCompetitive

Considering the bullet drop is very little it is quite easy to hit shots I got killed so many times out of no where for 150, footsteps are bugged I can’t hear people and shields are still not granted for kills its annoying being 150 and still getting one shot, a trap you must be really close to get someone they are balanced a heavy sniper does 150 at ANY RANGE!

My Response to Complaints and Complaints about Complaints.,"As someone who still loves this game even with all the decisions of epic, I have a choice to make.

But it is clear epic has a divide between the money people who want to bring casuals in (it is a job after all) don't listen and the devs who want to fix bugs and listen to the competitive community.

Every tournament shows which side is stronger. Since a ranked mode does not exist yet and epic made liquid vivid cry with a sword made of broken dreams.

But it is **clear that words aren't enough.** 

Even the casters at tourneys are silent about bugs and issues because **""its not their job to complain""**

I liken the choice to **the open ended choice of the brother in the parable of the prodigal son.**

TLDR; Help a noob get better. Or be a toxic jerk to as many noobs as possible. Its clear epic doesn't want to listen anymore. It's up to us to shape this community. Epic listens to the majority, which is casuals. When the majority becomes the Tryhards, then epic will listen. But for now, there are only two ways to that goal and making one billion Reddit posts isn't one of them.

One,

# The teacher route; 

**Inspired by the Competitive Teacher/Coach Commnunity**

***Teach and convert Casuals to Tryhards by showing them how to get better***. Like hot guys teaching a fat guy in a gym how to pump iron. That way, **RNG is more painful once they get better in skill**. (Death by bugs, RNG OP weapons, zombies is more painful than being outplayed.) That way they learn how to lose with grace and even make friends from those who bested them. ""***As iron sharpens iron, man sharpens man*****.** ***Proverbs 27:17***""

We are the Fortnite Competitive Community. The sweaty tryhard that people hate to fight but love to have on our side racking our win ratio, and padding our k/d. People like SpeedyGonzalez, Beaks, SypherPK, MonsterDFace, DestinysJesus, Convertible, ThatDenverGuy, Gronky, Martoz, UBalla. They help people get better. People who make edit courses and aim trackers. They help people get better.

People hate what they don't understand. **But we could teach them**. **Our passion can inspire passion**. And with Fortnite Scholarships and mini-tournaments, here and there, getting better if they want more ways to have fun. 

**We can welcome them. We help and accept them**. **Because it's the right thing to do. And in turn, it strengthens the community. Which is why I made ""From Bot to Tryhard Sweat"" to begin with.**

Or two, 

# The ""force the hand"" route;

**Inspired by Hostage Situations in movies**

***Trounce the casuals in Team Rumble and Creative, Troll them mercilessly again and again*** ***and force them to have a miserable time and never come back to the game again***. Losing isn't fun. Making no progress isn't fun. (Only works for the thin-skinned. People who want to prove people wrong will just keep playing) 

There has been toxicity in communities before. Depending on how good the game is, they can stop a person from playing a game. When they see how high the skill ceiling is in this game they will be daunted. Double, if the enemy pours salt on the wound with trash talk. And if casuals are little kids, then their minds can be shaped easily. It doesn't take much to stop a kid from playing a game. **Just keep them from having fun.**

If these Casuals can't have fun, what is the point? It's not fun to lose. The Casuals never come again, and Epic is forced to meet our demands because we are all that is left. Because **we loved the game enough to get good at it.** 

**We reject them. We take from them their ability to love this game. Why should they get the favor? Kids and Casuals are swayed by the latest greatest thing. They leave whenever something new and fresh comes out. The novelty will run out, a new game will come out, and they'll flock to that game instead. Only some people who put the time and effort into the game will stay in it. People who love the game. Like the people who still play Melee or Halo.** 

But above all. Why would epic listen to another complaint from some sweaty tryhard when there are a billion kids buying skins who are happy just to play the game? I choose to do something instead of saying something.

There is literally nothing more to be said. A cheap little console is never going to push out high fps so there is absolutely no point complaining. And your probably going to say ""oh well a PC is expensive"" well how do you think the majority of PC players have one? Obviously you have to save up. I'm sick of seeing console players complaining about these things its ridiculous, if they all put as much energy into complaining as they did into being patient, saving up and working hard for what they want they wouldn't have all these problems that frankly the majority of people are sick of hearing about. You don't have to be rich to buy a PC so stop complaining about what you have when other people probably play on mobile.

1. destroys structure like no other and can make a player waste 100-200 mats per rocket ( this when put into perspective can be 1/10 of a players total mat count in pop up). 
2. does 110+ damage to players in their explosive radius. This is more than half of maximum health in 1 shot. 
3. can pair with literally any other weapon and still be devastating. The RPG shines with the deagle. Using  RPG Deagle is guaranteed damage that is very hard to stop with turbo build delay and a little bit of lag. 
4. RPG on top of cone start: This can not only destroy someones 1x1 but also put u in a position to shotgun and kill them fairly easily and if done properly you don't take damage 
5. It is extremely potent late game and can destroy highground easily and can kill groups of enemies on high ground by making them fall. The explosive radius is so big that firing one RPG on high ground can practically destroy most if it.
6. U have 12 rockets enough said

Now onto weaknesses

1. long reload 
2. can be countered by building 
3. nothing else that I can think of.

Why does its strengths make it so strong?

To put it simply when used in the right hand it can be spammed to clear opponents mats or kill opponents if used right. The things about the RPG is that it is one of the only gun that can do those things(apart from deagle). Most guns have one specialty however the RPG has over 2.

&amp;#x200B;

How do we fix it without vaulting it?

1. we return its explosive radius back to what it was in season 2 and 3 and have be a weapon mainly used to kill people rather than clear masses of material quickly. (unlikely to happen)
2. we reduce the damage to what the quad making the RPG a Mat burning gun over a straight killing high damage weapon. (even more unlikely)
3. The least effective but most likely nerf would be to either reload time( not sure is it has already been nerfed) or rocket count (again). Now these are welcomed but preferred in my eyes as they solve the problem just not very well. 

All these nerfs are assuming that RPG stays as common as it is and as RNG as it is. 

This took a relatively long time to put together, so it would be great to know ur thoughts in the comments. Am I right? or is there a better solution I completely missed. ",FortniteCompetitive

I get it, sticks will never be as accurate as a mouse that uses an entire arm to aim vs just a thumb.   

 
I don't think anyone argues the need for it. We get it.
  

 
The problem is the abuse.     

  
People literally abuse aim assist.   

 
In this clip:   

[Here](https://mobile.twitter.com/GronKy_/status/1087423731608244224)  

The guy can't even see him, but tracks his enemy perfectly and land a headshot on him without ever having vision.   
 
The other problem about ""mouse accuracy"" is that in a bloom based system, pin point accuracy doesn't even matter. Yet a controller player can abuse the aim assit and just tap for constant ar shots.
PC player can't do that, at all. Our taps still have bloom, controllers tap don't   
  
[Proof]  
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqyIlY-DNLo) 
 
 
No one debates the need fo aim assist. 
The problem is that FN aim asists is way too forgiven and good player literaly abuse it.

Let's bring some facts into this:
* Yes, aim assist is powerful at mid range with an AR (or now, with a deagle, as the meta requires it). You can track your opponent very easily, as the distance makes his movement wrt you quite negligible compared to the strength of the aim assist lock when spamming ADS.
* No, aim assist doesn't make tracking easier than m&amp;kb in any other situation that the one mentioned above. You literally cannot track with an SMG in short range fights, when the opponent and you are both moving. A Teekzy SMG classic is impossible with a controller. Add jumping to that, and you're pretty much screwed (you can't ADS while jumping, ergo no aim assist). This has also repercussions on shotguns, for instance something as easy as a Tfue classic with m&amp;kb becomes way harder with a controller (no AA when jumping).
* In many other situations, such as many players facing you, AA can screw you over, as it may drive the cross hair towards the wrong opponent, or worse a vehicle. Hopefully, the vehicle AA will be fixed in next release.

There is one instance where controller players are advantaged (AR tracking), and I'll let you count in how many areas m&amp;kb have it better (keybinds for switching, sniping, tracking with any weapon, etc).

One instance. One. And some pros and their fans still have the guts the whine about it?

Just do what Mongraal does, switch to controllers in end game rotations for free kills, if it's so OP. But leave us with that single advantage (it's not asking much), thank you very much. ",FortniteCompetitive

As content creators and streamers? Excellent. As a pro team? I just don't think they're very good. Hamlinz I think has the most potential to become an excellent pro player. Myth has always been the one guy on TSM who's the competitor who goes to all the competitions, sort of TSM's poster child. The thing is, Myth just doesn't seem that much better than Hamz or Dae mechanics wise. The only real advantage Myth has is endgame knowledge, which explains why he more often than not goes much farther in a tournament setting than Hamz or Dae. Hamlinz has shown himself to be an excellent player mechanically. His building, editing, and aim is plenty good enough to compete against other pros but he and Dae just don't seem to know what to do when they get to endgame. Dae has said multiple times on stream that he doesn't scrim simply because he doesn't have fun playing that way (which is strange coming from a ""pro"" player""). Dae's aim is extremely good and his building is alright but it seems like he just doesn't care about trying to improve. It seems like he would rather play solos and provide entertaining commentary than anything else, which would perfectly fine if he wasn't signed a pro player.

TSM lately has been signing more dedicated pro players like Cowboy and Zexrow who scrim a lot and have shown to be great players, often winning more than their actual pro team. I really don't know what TSM is going to do with Hamlinz and Daequan unless they actually start improving and earning money in tournaments. Considering the bond that the three have formed with each other it just wouldn't be the same if they weren't all in the same house. It just seems like it would really difficult to separate them. It doesn't seem like TSM is afraid of kicking people out since Camills got benched and Kaysid moved in, despite the friendship him and Daequan formed. It's shocking that some of the more bigger streamers on twitch who are considered pro players have some of the lowest earnings and poorest performances in tournaments, relatively speaking.

Writing this felt like a big ramble but I'd like to know your guys' opinion on TSM fortnite. Is there hope for them? Will Hamlinz and Daequan try to improve someday? Do they just flat out suck? Idk man",FortniteCompetitive

I of course assumed I was just becoming bad and had become too comfortable with my 90s, but all of my friends that play on console have confirmed the same, that their instant build (especially on ramps) is horrible. Maneuvers like the Tfue classic have become a lot more difficult as well.

First things first - we need another ammo nerf. 6 rockets for GL (one full clip) and 3 rockets for rpg. 3 rockets is more than enough to kill someone / pressure someone and killing them + taking their 3 rockets they probably have in their inventory. One full GL clip is more than enough to spam at a third party buildfight or turtle. 

13 / 18 rockets is an absurd amount especially with the nerf of mats in popups. 

The next thing we need is drop off damage from blast radius, something that’s been talked about a lot in this community. A rockets splash damage right now is 100%, meaning that a rocket that lands 1.5 tiles away will do 110 damage just as a rocket to the face. The blast radius needs to drop severely (I’m talking down to 20 damage from the farthest possible range). A rocket to the player model should be max damage, and should decrease based on distance. 

Last thing is a rocket shouldn’t be able to break a roof, ceiling (floor above your head), 4 walls and the campfire you’re standing on. 

Rockets need a place in this game as there’s always risk / reward for inventory selection so taking it out isn’t a viable decision imo. 

TLDR; cut rocket ammo to 3/6 for rpg/GL, create splash damage drop off based on distance from explosion, nerf damage to builds so that it doesn’t destroy the floor you stand on in a turtle (unless the floor is shot from below of course). ",FortniteCompetitive

Thanks in advance for any advice and tips for me.

So I’ve been playing Fortnite on Xbox for about 10 months, I love it, I stream almost every day.

Recently I decided I wanted to improve my game a bit by trying out an elite controller.

First off I wanted to get some advice from a solid Xbox or PS4 player such that I could find out what fingers they use for there triggers and paddles. Currently I am most comfortable pressing both the trigger and bumpers with my index finger. I wanted to find out if you think it would be advantageous to hold the controller in such a way where my middle fingers pulled triggers and my index finger did paddles.

Next off I’m thinking I’ll use 2 paddles, I was thinking that it might be a great use of one paddle to either be “enter build mode AND edit” and the other to be jump. So that I can minimally remove my right thumb from the aim stick and drop the enter edit mode time to 0 so that I can edit VERY quickly. Or for one paddle have jump, and the other paddle be an “edit and confirm edit button” and continue having “enter build mode” as B.

Next off if anyone would be willing to dialogue with me about there fortnite settings like look sensitivity, I’d be interested what the top controller players are using.


To all you guys who play PC, I would use mouse and key board but it’s just so dang expensive to build one, so hopefully one day I’ll be able to buy in the mean time I’m gonna just use what I have and try to not abuse aim assist 😂

I am completely frustrated. I kinda like Fortnite more than I wanna admit. (I hate the Bloom Shit for a Passion tho and building triggers PTSD inside of me)  
I'm  an EX-CSGO Player, quit the Game mostly because I achieved my desired  Rank (LE) and the Game turned to shit after Gloves Update. Been always  playing with a cheap €10 Mouse and never had any issues with it and I was able to compete against People on my Skill Level who used Gaming Mouses, I'm average for the kinda Setup I use.

  
My Issue is: I can't build AT ALL and I've noticed that's because my Sensitivity is WAY too low, but I've always been a low Sense Wrist Player and I can't adapt to a higher Sense, just messes with my Muscle Memory of flicking and such.  
My Question is if buying a Gaming Mouse would somehow help me with my Issue, or if im really just playing the wrong Game? Because the Aim is alright, but without being able to build I just can't win a Game.

During S5 and S6 I had the best connection to the Fortnite servers, I was getting constant ping in the 30-60's with 0% packet loss. The implementation of sub-region matchmaking really helped me out. My ISP is, and has been Gigamonster for every season.

I downloaded the S7 update and immediately started to get packet loss around 20% for every game. In the brief moments without packet loss this season my ping is between 80-110, playable, but definitely not ideal. Since the Ice King event I haven't been able to play a game at all, packet loss 100%+ every game, and I eventually disconnect. Any other game I've tried playing works just fine, it's only Fortnite. If I use my Verizon hotspot I'm able to connect just fine and my ping is 40-80.

I know that there are other players that have similar issues with their ISP, Cox users out west, and Singtel for Asia players. I know the Cox players have had this issue prior to S7, but it sounds like the same issue, connection to Fortnite's AWS servers.  Some users have been able to use VPNs to fix the problem, but has anyone been able to find a fix for console players?",FortniteCompetitive

I got 182 solos, playing since release. Dunno if that’s decent or not. Haven’t won or had a high kill game in a while. 

I’m an older gamer so got responsibilities and such.

This game literally only ends one way, getting smashed by a godly player, early game late game doesn’t matter. 

This is pretty much the equivalent of a kid who got his license vs a pro formula one driver. 

Who wants to even drive that race? 
You’ve already lost with those players in the game, you’re not even coming close to winning. 

Even when you’ve got an overpowered advantage, these players just got the experience and no how to get around it. 

And these players are only going to get better while others lag further and further behind. 

I came second to a player the other day with 17 kills, I asked if he streamed and he said no. 

Man I like fortnite and really want to play more, but the nature of the lobbies just pushes me away more and more.

Been playing since the end of season 5 til now and I'm an average player with a couple of solo wins and about a 1.40KD. My main issue is that I'm always in my own head about stuff and I study things excessively to a point where I'm too focused on it. For instance I can't play the game naturally because I'm thinking too much about my hand movement or hitting the circle on a tree, it's not a natural thing for me. I've got pretty much the best gear possible but I keep switching between DPI's to find something that works. 

It feels like there is a delay between my mouse moving and what I see on the screen but I know it's not the case because I've adjusted all of my settings to be perfect. I play kovaaks as well, but I think I'm too anxious to play the game naturally.

Has anyone come across something like this? It sucks because I know I'm capable of being good at the game but my brain is just not helping me here. When I get high or drink beer it's a bit better because I'm thinking less if that helps.",FortniteCompetitive

Speaking both from the giving and receiving end, snipers shouldn't be able to one tap, they're often unavoidable, and worst of all they have the worst hitreg of any weapon (other than maybe RPGs, which also don't belong imo). There are times you can clearly see a bullet go through someone, look at the replay and it goes through them, look at a recording and see it go through them and still have them take 0 damage. Other times the snipe will go right past you or them and damage will still be dealt. 

As much as I like using them, there was a time when they provided a good skill gap to the game, but now, especially with the recent drop changes, it's hilariously easy to just pick people off. ",FortniteCompetitive

With L3 being my edit I didn’t like the way it felt to confirm with L3... it would mess up for me sometimes so I looked for an alternative. 

- I hold my controller with my right index finger on R1 and my middle finger on R2 at all times. This allows me to freely switch between my inventory as well as be ready for instant floors while in build mode.

- It might feel weird at first but once you get the hang of it the movement will seem pretty intuitive. I suggest using edit courses or even just building a tall 1x1 and edit down.

I was in the same boat, [these](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/dpozinen) are my stats. I've played a couple of games here and there before, I even got like 2 points or smth.

But now with the zombies (which i dont *really* mind most of the time, but they do get annoying) I finally decided to try a good 2h session of solos. And let me tell you, these were the best games I have ever played. I got 11 points, 7 from elims and 4 from placement. And I loved every second of the gameplay, it was just so different and refreshing to not have to constantly farm and look for shields. You dont fight guys who just walk and look up with their shotguns, everyone builds and tries to play smart and its soo rewarding to kill someone and also entertaining. 

But the best part is I realised I wasnt that bad for the amount of time I can put into the game. Its a great experience and you improve so much in a very small space of time.

I urge you guys to try them out, even if you feel youre not good enough. You just gotta approach them with right mindset and actually try to improve your game rather than just getting mad or blaming the game etc.


Tl;dr: play the cups, they're a great way to improve and very entertaining and rewarding. ",FortniteCompetitive

Epic's current point system for solos:

Kills:
- 3 kills = 1 point
- 5 kills = 1 point
- 7 kills = 1 point

Placement:
- Top 10 = 2 points
- Top 3 = 2 points
- Win = 2 points

Now there would be ranks: Bronze 1-3, Silver 1-3, Gold 1-3, Platinum 1-3, Diamond 1-3, Champion 1-3 and Grand Champion

Now the ranking up would work like this:

There is a point average per game for every individual rank. (This because some ranks might get more kill points than other ranks for varius reasons)

Let's say you are Platinum 2. The point per game average for platinum 2 is 1.

You are getting 1,5 points per game (on average through multiple games of course)

You will rank up to Platinum 3. There you'll be getting 1.2 points per game on average, and move to Diamond 1.

Turns out you were on a lucky streak and only get 0.7 points per game on average, you will derank back to Platinum 3 where you'll get consistent 1 points per game on average, so you'll stay there until you get fewer than 1 points per average and derank or you'll get more than 1 point and rank up again.

This is basically how deranking and ranking up would work.

Then the next problem is finding lobbies where everyone would be the same rank, impossible.

That's why you need to take platinum 2 players and diamond 1 players to the platinum 3 lobby.

If the rank average of the lobby is let's say platinum 2.5, and you are platinum 3 and get 3 points in the lobby, you will only get let's say 95 % of the 3 points (2.85)

This will work the other way around too for the plat 2 players. They will get 105  % points and so on.

This is to prevent extremely high que times, which by the way is unavoidable for the absolute highest ranks.

Psyonix has released the rank percentages of the player base if you want to look that up btw.

Do you like this? If not please say why.",FortniteCompetitive

So my question is what would you do about it? Would you vault it or would you nerf it? Please explain why. Also, keep in mind this is the comp sub so I only I don't care how it effects pubs, only the Pop Ups. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally would keep it, but make some changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

First, I would decrease the clip size to 5. This would help slow down people who just want to ""w-key"" and nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Second, I would decrease total heavy ammo that could be held to 30. This would help with people spamming deagle shots from their 1x1 and make them think about when they shoot. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Third, I would not allow it to one hit freshly built Metal. This would allow for some counter play when getting ""w-keyed""

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Fourth, I would adjust RPG spawns. I would decrease spawn rate or think about care package only. This would help greatly reduce people using the most powerful combo in the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Fifth and last, I would cut RPG Ammo to 7. Hold 6 with 1 in the clip. This is an indirect change to the deagle that will also effect its use. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

I feel like these change make the deagle still viable and not just another useless gun. The changes to the RPG are needed to balance the deagle more. The deagle is great by itself, but when you combo with an rpg it can be free damage/kills. 

I personally feel like  the deagle is a rewarding gun to use and would like it to still be an option over an smg. If you can't one shot wood and brick, it becomes a gun the you wont pick up anymore. Just my thoughts, let me know what you think. ",FortniteCompetitive

Get shoot once by a really bad player and die due to the rng of not finding shields when I could been fully shielded or have at least more health if kills give me heals or if at least Epic fixed the loot pool in chest. Opening 5 chest in a row and getting absolutely no kind of heals is just a no from me.

5 chest, got re deploys, got dynamites, got boom boxes, etc. There is so many more items that need to be vaulted, if Epic doesn't want to add kills give heals then their billion dollars worth company needs to figure out how to solve this issue. It amazes me how sometimes the community comes with brighter ideas than Epic themselves.

The timer has got to go because there are so many times where I will pump a player, place a floor, then take my shotgun out to shoot and be greeted by the timer circle causing myself to not be able to shoot which feels like such a clunky mechanic in this game.

Hold to place/swap hotkey.,"I didn't realize this until I tried playing on a keyboard, but why don't console players have the option to have same build mechanics as keyboard players? 

On PC, when you want to place a build, you have to select that key and then mouse click. On console or you have to press your 'switch mode' keybind and then you can place your builds. The problem is sometimes, it does not switch, and you will end up shooting your wall if you're going to quickly. I don't know how often this is due to not actuating the button fully versus being a server issue.

Another thing to note is that there is somewhat of an advantage to builder pro; it doesn't require to coordinate your builds with a secondary input, i.e mouse click. 

What I suggest is allowing players on console the option to enable a similar system to keyboard. For instance if I hold down my paddle button, which is assigned to build, it will switch into 'build mode' but as soon as that button is released it will swap back to 'combat mode'.

The same thing could be applied to weapon swapping, using the pickaxe keybind.

In order to even the playing field between console and pc, something like this has to be implemented. I've played with keyboard and on console and there is no question that keyboard is so much more fluid to play on. Has Epic said anything regarding this? ",FortniteCompetitive

I'd like to make a few suggestions and hear what you guys have to say about shotguns.

**Heavy Shotgun:**

* No change

As it is, I think the heavy shotgun is in a pretty good place compared to the other shotguns. It's got slightly lower damage than the pumps, but it has much better range.

​

**Pump Shotgun:**

* Change Green / Blue / Purple / Gold body shot damage to 80 / 85 / 90 / 95
* Change headshot multiplier to 2.5 (Max damage 200 / 212.5 / 225 / 237.5)

If these changes were implemented for the pump shotgun, there would be no more cheesy 100+ damage body shots, and all pumps would be able to one-shot someone with full shields. This would also eliminate the massive difference between the green and blue rarities, because no other type of gun has such an enormous increase in power just between 1 rarity level.

**Tac Shotgun:**

* Revert environmental damage nerfs
* Change headshot multiplier to 2.5 (Max damage 167.5 / 175 / 185)

I think we can all agree that the tac shotgun needs some love, and it hasn't been touched since it was nerfed all the way back in season 4. With a damage increase to both players and structures, I think the tac shotgun could become a viable choice again.

**All shotguns:**

* Remove the mechanic where 3 pellets worth of damage are applied when 1 or 2 pellets hit

​

Now for the potentially controversial part, just bear with me.

​

I know a lot of people dislike double shotgun, but I personally would like to see it return, and with the changes listed above, I think it would be balanced and add more weapon variety to the game, and Epic has said they wanted to add more loadout variety in the past.

​

I think double shotgun would be balanced with these changes because double pump or double heavy would still be quite effectively countered by building due to low environmental damage, but the pump-tac or heavy-tac combo would more effectively counter builds to give it an edge over the other double shotgun combos. Pump-tac could then also compete with the ability of pump-smg and pump-deagle to destroy builds. The reduction to pump body shot damage also serves to make it impossible to 2 shot someone with a couple quick 100+ damage body shots while double pumping, while the extra headshot damage on pumps would still make single pump loadouts viable.

I played a bot only mode to get myself decent at the game, won it, and then tried an online match to see how I did there.

I was immediately killed by an amazing player. It made me think of Fortnite, and how it would’ve felt the same way if I was a new player. Then I stopped playing online because of how good the players were there. I thought about “What if they added OP guns in RoE to help the casuals, like in Fortnite?” And after a while of thinking about it, it’s a terrible idea. Adding items to help out the casuals is a terrible idea. Instead, they need a ranked mode. I’m pretty sure they even have one, I’m just not gonna play that competetively in that game as much, so I’m not gonna try it.

It just makes it more clear on how Fortnite should’ve chosen the ranked mode path as well at the start of season 5 and not added items to help the casuals. It would’ve helped the game so much.

Idk I just felt like I needed to say this lol.",FortniteCompetitive

It widens the potential skill gap and decreases RNG to a non-zero but reasonable level. 

In response, professional teams intensify their research and pros from other games (e.g. CS:GO) start to transition, attracted by the huge prize prospects in FN. 

Hence the QST: *Will current top pro players still be there in 1 year?* 

I am sometimes appalled by the work ethics, poor psychological performance and lack of strategical depth of current top players. Roles barely exist in the current meta. For the CS:GO follower that I am, the gap seems stratospheric. I feel that if young top CS:GO players would transition to FN and apply their work ethic their, in no time they would catch up and overcome the current competition. 

Of course I exaggerate here: I'm sure some of the top elements will survive, due to incredible acquired game sense and adaptability. But I somehow doubt it. ",FortniteCompetitive

Please add a Fortnite server in Santiago, Chile. (I'M FROM PERU)

Why specifically Santiago, Chile? Look at this map of fiber-optic cables in the world:

[http://media2.govtech.com/images/940\*489/Submarine+cable+map.png](http://media2.govtech.com/images/940*489/Submarine+cable+map.png)

Now look at Chile. There are two cables of interest, one that connects the western countries and another that connects to Argentina near Uruguay. Setting up a server there would greatly increase connection speeds in all of South America, even to Central America.

In South America we only have the server in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Unfortunately, the internet connection between that server and the rest of South America has a high ping even to neighboring countries such as Argentina. The connection has so much ping that a lot of times we get connected to games in US servers because it has a lower ping, which creates frustrating situations due to the extremely high lag and the language barrier. Additionally, playing with friends from other countries such as Chileans playing with Colombians will inevitably get someone playing in a high ping match, either a Colombian playing in the Brazilian servers or a Chilean playing in the US servers, to give an example.

Other games have realized this and have set up servers in Santiago Chile, such as League of Legends, Overwatch, Dota2, some even going as far as setting up a different region for Brazil and a different one for the rest of Latinamerica, helping fix the language barrier problem we face every day between Spanish and Portuguese. Santiago is one of the tech startup capitals of the world, one of the reasons for that is that it is very well connected to the rest of the world.

We love your game, but the ping situation is our main problem, when we find a match with less than 100 ping we consider that a really good day, but the norm is more at 150 - 200 depending on the country. We want to be great, we have the passion and the skills, would you help us take the next step to being in the world stage of Fortnite?",FortniteCompetitive

The ability to switch between weapons and builds so quick, the insane shotgun hits and the complete control these M&amp;KB guys have in turtle wars, has made me realise that I’m just wasting my time trying to get better on controller. I have been thinking about the switch for a pretty long time, and now turtle wars have completely convinced me and I regret not making the switch earlier.

I'll be playing M&amp;KB on my PS4 first. If things go well, I'll probably buy myself a gaming desktop but I want to start practising as soon as I can. My M&amp;KB will be delivered tomorrow, and in order to get comfortable as fast as possible, I need some advice. I want keybinds that give me the most potential right away, rather than having to switch them again in a few months. So I just looked up a couple pro's keybinds and thought Tfue's keybinds looked pretty good because everything seems withing reach:

Use = F

Jump = Space 

Crouch = Left shift

Pickaxe = 1

Slot 1 = 2

Slot 2 = 3

Slot 3 = 4

Slot 4 = 5

Slot 5 = 6

Switch quickbar = P

Wall = C

Floor = E

Stairs = Q

Roof = Mouse button 5

Trap = Mouse button 6

Edit = V

Inventory = I

However, I can find so many keybinds it's so hard to decide how to start. A lot of players use a lot of building binds on their mouse (Sypher for example uses his 2 mouse thumb buttons for floor &amp; stairs, and his wheel for roof). Is this advantageous? I was also wondering, is your edit confirm key the same key as your enter edit key? And what is your edit reset key? I heard of the edit reset scroll wheel trick, how does that work and how do I set my keybinds to being able to use it?

Another thing is sensitivity. At what sensitivity should I start? Should I start low or high? I'm talking both in-game and DPI.

Asian player here from India. Most of the players in my region connect to servers, by a broken method. Their algorithm first decides if there are enough player in a region to connect to the closest server, which in 90% of cases, I can't find. 

The result is a large difference between two servers (Tokyo and SEA). On SEA I get 70ms ping and on Tokyo I get 180ms. An organization called ftn India organizes scrims at evening, where half of the players connect to sea, and other to Tokyo. The result is disadvantage for Tokyo players.

Seriously, luck based servers???

The pro scene will die soon here if this remains the case. I play this game to remove frustration and stress, not increase stress. 

Tldr, just let the SEA server be a dedicated server, let us choose where to play. I don't care long waiting times, even if it's for several minutes. 

Please upvote this post even if you are not from Asia, it maybe help some brothers.

Many people say if you die in top 50, lose no points... or even gain points starting in top 25-40 placement... well this is just going to lead to plane max height chilling / hiding if we reward such high placements. My opinion would be to structure the system where you only gain placement points from being in top 10, and lose if you are in place 11-100. Hear me out though, 11-100th place will slowly lose elo for dying outside of top 10 while top 10 gets a much larger bonus for making it there. So if you don’t make top 10 5 games but hit top 10 in the 6th game, it should roughly show that you’re getting into average placements (not exactly but you’re getting my point). Placement points == rare but when you get it, big elo bonus. 

Things like kills and deaths for elo gains/losses should be roughly equivalent, you gain just about the same (or maybe a little less to have decay) points for a kill as you lose from dying. In this case, placement and eliminations are two entirely different stats and will contribute to the elo separately.

Edit: keep in mind that when I mean top 10 placement, I don’t mean everyone in top 10 gets the same amount of points. What I’m suggesting is that you only begin to gain points for placement starting at top 10. Each place starting from 10 would get more and more points.",FortniteCompetitive

For background, I am not an amazing player: my K/D is around 1.5. Fortnite is not technically my first shooter, since I used to play TF2 5-6 years ago, but it's the first time I have had to worry about having good aim and mechanics.

Fortnite has really interesting and unique mechanics, so sometimes I like to zone out and watch TV while I just build/edit randomly in playground/creative for like 30 minutes. When edit courses started becoming available, I saw the Noizeeh and Martoz course and decided to start going through that for fun. I started keeping track of my times in a sticky note of my desktop and ended up doing it for every run. Eventually I realized it had been a while and I moved over to a simple spreadsheet and just hit 100 today.

Here's a chart of my progress: https://i.imgur.com/3KJmGjx.png

I mostly wanted to just share, but here are some thoughts I have as well:

- The course didn't really help my improve my 90s, every time I did the 90s at the beginning of the course it felt more like a test rather than practice. I think 90s are better left for an open environment where you can just spam them over and over.
- I got a lot better at doing awkward edits from this course. This translated to in game surprisingly well as I noticed I would go for edit plays a lot more often because they felt more natural to do.
- The aim section of this course helped a lot with precisely hitting small targets and also with edit + shooting with a shotgun, but I don't think (or really tries to) help with things like tracking or flicks.
- Some parts of the course you just get good at because you start to learn it so well. Knowing exactly where all of the targets were going to be made me start to pre-aim, which seems a bit besides the point of practice.
- Halfway through doing this, I realized I could go up the 1x1 section much faster and that my strategy was pretty slow (edit out floor, jump and reset, edit out stairs, jump and reset) so simply changed that dropped some time.

Overall, I definitely think that the course helped me improve, especially in regards to edits, although I would recommend something else to people who want to improve in other areas.

---

Misc: Here were my personal ""rules"" for each run:

- For the first aiming section, I used the AK until it ran out of ammo, and then the normal AR for the last 4 targets
- I used the heavy for the first set of edit shots, reloading once since there are 8 targets
- I used the pump for the second set of edit shots, since there are exactly 5, I placed a ramp + floor to edit through here
- I would not progress until I shot every target
- If I messed up a cone jump, I would go back and try it again
- I placed walls and a ceiling on all sides of the pistol guys section and edited through the front wall",FortniteCompetitive

* Click a button and know their gun will be there. It's always scrolling back and forth. One click a little off, and now you're on a gun you didn't expect.
* INSTANTLY access that gun, build piece, anything... on console you're switching back and forth, you're toggling, you're scrolling. It's night and day.
* Apparently, shoot automatic weapons as well (tied to framerate, but still)
* Jump in the air and hit flick shotgun shots. PC players may not know this but on console you basically can't do this - you have to actually set your shots up and aim, it's nearly impossible to jump in the air and hit shots accurately, consistently, on console
* Change the game to their will, changing graphical settings and screen resolution to literally **see more of the game**
* Shoot whatever you want without having aim assist drag your crosshair to whatever the game deems the priority
* Run the game at incredible framerates
* Build consistently. Depending on the console &amp; performance, sometimes lag hits and things just won't place

While I recognize that it's a BR and there are RNG factors in the game, the huge disparity between getting a grey weapon and one of any other rarity (in terms of damage output) is extremely offputting. I feel like the loot pool would feel a lot more exciting if everything grey was vaulted.

I managed to get 25 points in the Solo Cup today, didn't play it from start to end either, can't focus for 5h in a row. Heres how my session went:

###Before first match:
15 minutes before first match, i was nervous because of coffee and not trusting my ability with m&amp;kb. I usually don't drink coffee, but today before i knew there was Solo Pop Up Cup i did and coffee seems to make me nervous and anxious. I was never nervous in these with controller.

###First Match: 
Planned on playing passive the whole Cup. Landed to one of the houses between  Frosty Flights and Happy Hamlet. Played really passive, others were fighting and i tried rotating  using only necessary amount of mats. Barely won game with 3 kills, i was shaking for some reason. I won because nobody else had mats and shield left since i had lasered them when they were fighting and trying to keep up with the zone. I had 7 points after the first game.

###Next game:
Got in Top 10, had great rotations, a lot of mats in end game and were ""gatekeeping"" many people from highground and did some decent damage. In one of the moving circles i third partied a fight when both of them seemed low, jumped to highground and killed one of them. Missed (mostly because of not being confident) 2 easy shots to the next one and died. Got 2 points from that match, resulting in total of 9.

###Couple next games: Still played very passive Got top 15 almost every game, and even though i tried to advoid fighting as hard as i could, i got pushed by multiple people every game. I wasn't even in a good spot for next zone, most of the times both the ""pusher"" and me ended up dying due to the stupid push. One game i managed to get top 3, choked again. Resulting in 14 points.

###Slump: After reaching 14 points playing ultimately passive, it started being way harder. I got pushed harder every game and tried to just disengage most of the times, the players were mechanically good but definetly didn't know when they should back up, or didn't care about placement. I got frustrated after reaching top 15 multiple times but dying mostly stupid ways, obviusly i made many mistakes too, but biggest one was playing too passive. I couldn't just get past 14 points and even hot dropped couple times, lost focus too and tried landing Happy Hamlet multiple times and dying early by not paying attention.

###Breaking out of the slump:
After many frustrating games i kept slight break 10mins max, ate little, put some music and started again. Couple bad games until i managed to bring my focus back, effect of Coffee was probably gone too. I decided to stop being scared of fighting and take it like a man.

###Second last game:
Landed straight to Happy Hamlet, felt faster and more focused. One dude landed with me, but i managed to smoothly kill him from 200 hp without losing any hp myself, just because i trusted in my ability to win the fight and did my best. Fought another 1v1 on top of the mountain with planes near Happy Hamlet, won it without losing any health, again. Luckily i got zone on the mountain and even next one (small aleardy) was on the side of the mountain. I kept huge highground and did good damage on the guys below, shot planes down and held pressure on enemies. Used Rift to go for the next circle far away, got 3rd even though i should've easily won it, choked shots and didn't blocks shots even though i had mats, but played otherwise the game near perfectly. After this game i had 19 points, decided that next game is the last one and i really wanted the pin.

###Last game: Goal was to get atleast 1 point for to get the pin (20), landed again Happy Hamlet, but now with 2 dudes, felt very comfortable still. I let the enemies fight while i was looting and shielding up, went there after their fight and won the 1v1 fairly easily. Zone was far and ended up fighting two dudes during the rotation, won both and i felt really good, i got 20 points. Kept playing really agressive and was really suprised by my own skill. Got into long fight with amazing player and we both hit eachother hard until, almost trapped him too, he barely broke out. I disengaged with rift. Got 6 kills that game and 3rd place, huge fps drops made it kinda hard but could've played the end better. The same ""amazing player"" won the game with 9 kills, i was very happy at my performance, 25 points and i had long and really even fight with the guy who won. Playing agressive and trusting in my ability helped me a lot. Fps in end game definitely is not ideal wich makes winning games hard. I look foward to future cups though.

They know of the complaints toward shield. So why are they so hesistant to outeight increase them?

More shield equals better players prevailing. Yea, the old classic ""making it so anybody can beat anybody"". 

In call of duty, ttk (time to kill) was universally seen as a higher skill gap. It allowed for more chances of turning on someone, and getting two or three pieces. Ghosta had one of the lowest skill gaps because of its insanely low ttk (great hit detection played into it as well but thats besides the point). You saw someone first you won the gun fight (if youre good and hit your shots and have half decent ping of course). In black ops 4 treyarch listened to the comp community and added a never before seen ttk and healing system (partially to match blackout health as well but again besides the point). This allows for some insane outplays that just werent possible on lower health games.

Epic is willing to add splode damage through walls on a whim. Swords with regenerating 400 health. But they are hesitsnt to add more shield. This is why. The siphon game mode was a god send for pro players. They were straight slaying out. It obviously increased the skill gap. 200 health allowed for this. When youre low health its incredibly hard for a pro player to outplay lower tier players. Epic wants this. ",FortniteCompetitive

I bumped it up to 800 and 1,000 and both seem to feel better but now i'm stuck on this fence after reading that the best way to develop muscle memory is to use a sensitivity that correlates in game, and out of game.    
 Now a majority of my time is spent at work using a mouse that works at 1,000 DPI so should I try to work around that on my gaming PC to develop a bit more efficiently? or am I just being a bit over obsessive about this. ",FortniteCompetitive

My set up is far from top tier, but I used to be able to run the game at 144 FPS capped (smooth and stable). Near the end of Season 5, I can only get around 120 FPS which drops to around 100 FPS whenever there is an enemy on my screen. 

After the latest patch, I my FPS is dropping to 70-80s whenever I engage an enemy. This makes it such an eye sore to play with. 

Epic really does need to pay attention to how their patches affect PC performance, and dish out some optimisation updates. Please up-vote so they can see this. ",FortNiteBR

Epic: tfk_FireKing
Xbox: FireKingBridges
Update: v5.0
Whenever I was playing around Season 3/4, I turned aim assist off to help me improve my aim, so when I turned it back on, I would be even better at aiming. Instead, whenever I turned aim assist back on, I had no aim assist. It wasn't really a problem due to the double shotgun exploit/meta people had been using, but now that the double shotgun exploit was removed, I've been mowed down by smgs, lasered by people who had AR's, and point-blanked by people who have shotguns, all thanks to their aim assist working, but mine wasn't. I'll occasionally get a kill with a shotgun, AR, or smg, but I'm always destroyed by them. I tried an experiment, as I unlinked my Xbox account, made a smurf account, linked the smurf account and started playing. Amazingly, my aim assist had worked on that account, but when I relinked my original account, I still had no aim assist. Could you please fix this problem?",FortNiteBR

I’m making this in hopes that Epic might see this. I understand that STW would probably be too much for the switch so I won’t mention it.

We still can’t see our stats on the switch, and we know they’re being tracked by the fact that we all received emails telling us some of our stats.  

Correct me if i’m wrong, but switch players are now being paired up with xbox and ps4 players. The joy-cons for the switch don’t have as wide a range of motion, and just aren’t made for shooters compared to the xbox or ps4 controllers. We also have lower graphics, and players from far away are much blurrier.

I feel like the ability to record videos on the switch should be an option. I realize why they disabled it, but some people don’t mind the lag as much if they can record cool trickshots, snipes etc.

TLDR; Fortnite for the switch is a bit neglected and needs stats, separate lobbies and to have the video recording as an option.",FortNiteBR

Spam meta has lowered the skill ceiling and left a lot of people extremely bored of the game. I know that Epic won’t undo what they’ve changed but I’d still like to have a discussion about it. 

Spam meta over all requires way less skill than double shotty did, it relies much more on luck with bloom than anything else while double shotty primarily required good flick aim or tracking. I barely play the game anymore and definitely avoid it if friends aren’t online because the way the game plays now is so mundane and annoying without them. Even then it’s sometimes a struggle to enjoy playing because the problems with the game shine in squads more than duos and solos. Having 4 people spam smgs at you while you are trying to get an advantage over them is probably one of the most frustrating things I’ve experienced in game. Then you add splodes on top of that and if just drives us away. 

I played a lot of season 3 and 4 but have taken long breaks in 5-6 due to these changes. I feel like Epic changed the game to directly counter people that took the time to get skilled and made it so that 4 below average players can just hold the fire button and destroy any chance you had at winning. There is a reason most people don’t do solo squads anymore, it’s nearly impossible.",FortNiteBR

The handcannon is also the only weapon that shoots heavy bullets but doesn't have a 2.5x headshot multiplier, so it would more make sense from that standpoint as well. I don't think that this buff alone is really enough to make the handcannon a viable weapon in most situations, but this change in conjuction with a few other minor changes (maybe changing the firerate from 0.8 to 1) would really help to make the handcannon a more useful gun.",FortNiteBR

Been playing since Stw day 1.

It has nothing to do with playing since day . It has something to say about character.

If you enjoy the game how it is, great for you keep playing.

For me, epic rereleasing the skin just shows how much they care about the game and community as a whole. THE GAME CAN ONLY GO DOWN FROM HERE. They might add a few more ridiculous items to the game before they run out of ideas. That’s when epic is going to get desperate. Very soon y’all are going to be seeing the UPMOST stupid shit epic has ever released. The games not dead but it does have cancer.

I hate to say this but it’s the truth. EVERYONE ruined this game (including myself) by giving into “skins” when they first came out. Imagine the state of the game right now if people never “bought skins”. I promise you guy epic would put so much more heart and thought into the game if they weren’t sitting on a fat stack.

Epic had the ENTIRE world on their shoulders, but is settling with what you see right now. The game isn’t going to go anywhere from here, this is what you guys get. Like I said, if you enjoy the game right now, please keep enjoying it. I wish I could say the same.

The upcoming of the game was the most fun I’ve had in so long. Probably since the release of COD4. But Fortnite has Weeded out people that bring variety to the game and is now just like every other game out there.",FortNiteBR

Im just gonna say that right away. Yes, you have a lot of cool ideas and the developers listen to you. But, this whole OG culture is just... thrash. No game Ive ever seen have had this kinda thing. As an example, league. They have an open skin market, which means you can buy any skin at any time, except if it is a legacy skin. There, people only get happy if the legacy skins come back, and everyone can accept it. But in Fortnite, whenever a skin that is considered OG, people get upset, for some reason. Okay, we understand that you have played the game for a year, but why would a company, whose goal is to make money, not re-release a popular skin? Do the people that consider themselves OG think that they are much better than everyone else for having these skins?

Today skull trooper was re-released. If you look at the IG post saying this, almost all of the comments are about how the person writing them is ""OG"" and ""Im DELETING THIS GAME"" and ""ohhhh Im soo gooood because I have an old skin and why would anyone else get to have it"". People, it is a year old game, get your shit together about this OG think.

Okay okay, no biggie. I mean, I'll just buy the skin and get the challenges done right?

WRONG. So they apparently added a different colour to that backbling just for the ""OG's"".

I mean come on EPIC what the hell...

You're going to have me spend 1,500 vbucks (15 EUROS/DOLLARS) on a backbling and it isn't even the fucking full thing.

I don't care for the purple ugly looking Turd skin, I just want the Ghost Portal and now I may not even get that, since it isn't the fucking full thing.

I shouldn't need an update almost as big as the original download size (12ishgb) to play after the season 6 update was 10gb itself. I cant afford a computer (inb4 pc masterrace) so I'd like at least a bit more warning about these updates, and not on a subreddit some players dont frequent. This is the second time now I've had the pleasure of a surprise 10gb update and I'm starting to not want to organize playing it with people because what's the point if we all sit down for an update?

I think creating a style for OG Skull trooper owners was extremely lame and opened up Pandora's box on Epic applying ""OG status"" to item shop skins. Despite Skull Trooper being a part of the first item shop ever, it is still just an item shop skin at the end of the day. Everyone is paying 1500 v-bucks regardless of when they bought it. But buying it now gives you a worse product for the same price. Epic want to have their cake and eat it too. I think they set a very bad precedent for the item shop buy selling Skull Trooper at full price while giving exclusive content to previous owners. You now are at risk of missing out on content if you didn't buy everyone item during it's initial run. I feel like they are just trying to snowball impulse buys and create more anxiety around the item shop than there already is. I think this is the shadiest thing Epic have done so far.

Here's what has lead up to this,

- Re-releasing the Valentines day skins months later after setting a precedent with the Halloween and Christmas skins, that seasonal skins were only available during the corresponding season. Obviously this was just to rake in the back bling $$$.

- Having the value of skins seemingly random at times. Why does Skull Trooper have 3 styles and a backbling for 1500 when Fate has nothing other than the skin for 2000 v-bucks. These numbers really seem like ass grabs.

- Intentionally not including items in the rotation just to build up hype and anxiety from players fearing they will never have a chance to buy them again. A.K.A the Red Knight effect. More of a personal problem of mine where I think the others on this list are objectively shady.

- Locking content of an item away for ""OGs"" while charging the same price to new customers.

- Fortnite is 1 year old and they still don't have a confirmation button for v-buck purchases.

- Lastly, intentionally not giving any context as to how they operate the item shop so they can continue to make up the rules as they go without being held accountable.

As much as I love Fortnite and what Epic are doing in alot of areas, the way they run the item shop is bullshit. I think there needs to be some level of transparency with how the item shop works and what we can expect to happen with those items in the future. If this is the route Epic are going to go, I'd rather them keep item updates exclusive to already exclusive items (ex. Season Shop, Battlepass items). Like maybe if you own Black Knight you can get a black style for Red Knight. Maybe make a Ruby Rose skin for people who own John Wick. Oblivion light styles for people who completed the Omega challenges is another good one. This gives more bang for your buck if you have these skins and gives extra incentive to buy legendary skins. This IMO is the way to do this. Keep item shop skin updates accessible to everyone (ex. the Tomatohead update), and give the OG treatment only to exclusive items.

What I have an issue with however is Epic has seemingly bowed to those who have continuously cried about loosing this mythical 'OG status'. By adding a Purple reskin it sets a precedent if you cry enough, you'll get something the general community isn't privy too.

They should have brought it back as was, left it at that, instead they've thrown another stupid colour to cater for those who love to cry.

It makes a political statement on many things and one of those things is Capatalism, all 100 players fight each other to be the number one winner, taking what they can get from the other player at any means, regardless of the other players, this is clearly symbolism of Capatalism and Epic Game's message that Communism is the only way, as showed in Squads, the best squads are the ones that share their loot equally, it's a statement on economical systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's also take into account the wide varrey of rich high class locations on the map, Lazy Links for example, then at the bottom on the map you have farms and crop fields, but wait, there used to be another crop field remember? Anarchy Acres, but what happened to Anarchy Acres? it got demolished and replaced with a gold course, but Fatal Fields still stands, why? Because as you can see this season, they're flourishing with crops, so while Anarchy Acres got destroyed, the other farmer was able to out-buy everyone and take out the compitetion. This is clearly one of Epic Game's many statements on Capatalism, and in the end of it, us, the players, in Fortnite are fighting for absolute power, no matter how many buildings or houses we destroy in the process, we just trample over every farmer, business owner, home owner, for our own win, the ultimate capatalism. And where does our winnings go after we win? Right back to Epic, sure we may level up and unlock a new item, but this is clearly symbolism for the government trying to reward people for being slaves to them, to keep them brainwashed and stop them from retaliating, it's clearly symbolism for us as the player obeying the government and doing their deeds, destroying farms, so they can build new golf courses.

At this point I decided to try to win, and waited for the other 2 to start fighting so I could jump in with a Rift-to-go.

I did said action, dropped in and killed one, and the other one hid underneath me in his base. He and I fought for a very brief moment and it ended in my demise. He played very sloppily (didn’t really build, and when he did it was all over the place, along with being a pretty poor shot), and I was a bit salty for dying to someone like that.

So I ended up sending him light hate mail and simply said “Congrats on your first win” since it seemed like it was (judging by how sloppy his PvP skills were). I then looked him up on the Fortnite tracker to see how many he really had..... and it turns out that actually WAS his first win (in solos).

I had just accidentally complimented him, and I felt stupid, but it also made me feel good because I’m the type to send more hate than anything else. It got me to think about why the hell I even send hate mail, what’s the point?

Shout out to you, Hanksogge77, for making me think twice about being an ass in the future, and congrats on the first win!",FortNiteBR

The back bling will most likely go to the trooper to incentivize as many people as possible to purchase the skin, but be prepared that the female ranger skin may have the back bling to try to get you to buy both.",FortNiteBR

The Halloween and Xmas skins at this point are essentially what the founder items were supposed to be. These skins now serve as a way for the early adapters to show that they have supported epic from the early days of Battle Royale. 

Think about it... this game hadn’t yet blown up to crazy levels back in Halloween ‘17. Players that bought those skins weren’t buying them to be an “OG”. They were buying them because they wanted to invest their time and money into Battle Royale before the game really took off.

Due to the game’s popularity blowing up in 2018, these skins now show which players have played the game since the early days and STILL play the game now! Epic putting Halloween and Xmas skins back in the shop would completely erase that and take away any clear signs of who the early adapters are. I think it’s pretty cool seeing people rocking these skins. I like the mystique and uniqueness it brings to the lobby and game. 

I’m open to other opinions and I am looking forward to hearing what you all think about this topic. ",FortNiteBR

Others want it to be re-released because they really like it and think it's cool, they don't care about how rare it is.

There are other skins out there that are rare, such as Season 1 Level Skins, Christmas skins (even they won't be rare much longer), Mogul Masters and Alpine Aces, and Sgt. Green Clover (well kinda).   
To maybe fix the problem with these nubs caring about their precious halloween skin to be ""rare"" to all players, Epic can add a special feature to all players who bought the skin the first time, such as a customizable option or extra accessory. That will let players know how that's an OG player, and they'll be intimidated. But maybe not?

Even though Epic could possibly release other halloween skins, people still want Ghoul and Skull Trooper released along with them. 

Who knows what Epic will do. The leaks are uncertain, so you shouldn't trust them.

The circle just doesn't seem random. If you spawn on the right and the 1st circle is to the left, you run and just make it . Next circle spawns far left again, more running. If you drop on top of the map and the circle spawns on the bottom, run down to make it, 2nd circle spawns far bottom again.

When circle spawns on me, I imagine the furthest point away that someone is travelling from and then I watch for 2nd circle and again it screws ppl who have run the furthest.

If the circle was always random, then fair enough these moments can happen. But it has got so predictable that my friends can almost pinpoint perfectly where 2nd circle will be based on the first circle.

So exactly how random is the circle? u/JustMooney1 u/S-LG",FortNiteBR

In PUBG, even when the circle spawns across the map, you still have a chance if you can find your way to a motorbike or a car or something. I've had some very narrow escapes from blue death that way. 

With FN, if the circle spawns far away all you can really do is run like hell...and even then, after the first one or two, it is so fast you are probably going to die. Plus, the whole time you are hauling butt across all the open ground you are very exposed to snipers and people who are similarly racing to get back into the circle.

It's not super bad per se, but feels just a tiny bit out of adjustment somehow. I think it would be fine as-is, with bicycles or something so you could go fast enough to beat the circle. ",FortNiteBR

Instead, I think itd be cool to make SMGs the only silenced guns in the game. It would make them a strategic weapon class that would be great at stealth and sneaking up on enemies unnoticed. It would be a worthwhile pick and help diversify playstyles

Buffing the damage can only do so much and is a rather boring way to make SMGs useful, and I think silencing it makes it a much more interesting weapon.

This way, the SMG can stay relatively weak, but have the benefit of surprising enemies or finishing off opponents without making noise that attracts opponents. It would still be a low damage weapon, and not one that you challenge any other weapon class with, but simply offers you a stealth option. ",FortNiteBR

Players are hiding in the environment and I feel that's an exploit that should be addressed. I know it's a video game but in real life a bush isn't a green bubble of invisibility - bushes have branches and if you try to hide in one you will hurt yourself AND the bush. 

A bush that's been trampled has a distinct appearance in real life. To me it's the same as the doors on buildings in BR games - You can fool people by closing the door behind you making it look like no one has been there - but with a bush there's no way to tell if someone is hiding in one. 

Hiding in a bush isn't OP but it is ridiculous. This game is so much fun and offers so many ways to play against each other with all the building options.

We will be pushing a Battle Royal specific update within the hour aimed at adjusting weapon balance. There will be no downtime. Players will not need to update their client.

See you in-game!

**Battle Royale Update - Oct 6th**

* **Increased Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle damage by 50%.** This weapon was often passed up because of its lower damage. This increase will put it closer in line with its intended effectiveness.
* **Decreased Scoped Assault Rifle damage by 33%.** This weapon was too effective at its current role and needed to be scaled back slightly.
* **Decreased Grenade, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher environmental damage to 375 (was 450).** Metal forts will now require two explosive blasts (instead of one). Late-game bases are too easily destroyed and we want to promote building diversity.

* **Increased Rocket Launcher reload time by 20%.** It's a little too easy to spam rockets. We want the Rocket Launcher to be a powerful weapon, but it's a little too good right now.
* **Increased Submachine Gun damage by 10%.** The Submachine Gun is underperforming at close to medium range combat. This damage increase will improve its effectiveness slightly. We'll continue to keep an eye on it.

2. Accuracy seems a bit fucky and can be hard to understand in FNBR. So mash/hold that primary fire button till you're empty. The more bullets you shoot the bigger the chance you'll hit something. Don't worry about reloading in a fight, you'll either be dead or victorious. 
3. Build the biggest fucking fortress you can manage. People will look at it and think ""Oh, boy. Don't wanna mess with that dude.""  
4. Snipers are trash, don't even pick them up. 
5. SMGs are good.  
6. The scoped AR is dishonorable  
7. Make sure you land next to an enemy player. You wanna get that first kill ASAP. While he's picking up that shotgun, you're gonna be jamming your pickaxe through his skull. Alright? Then, grab his shotty and jump down and look for more people to kill, they'll be everywhere around you so you'll have a lot of kills by the time this is over. 
8. ALWAYS engage. See somebody on the horizon? Fuck them up.  
9. Never sneak. It only slows you down. Plus the trail of dust you're leaving behind you that can be seen a mile away? Nobody will think about surprise attacking you. They see that and think ""that's a killing machine right there. That's a MAN."" They know they have no chance against you so they'll avoid you.  
10. *In the unlikely event that in which you die* (which you shouldn't, if you've been following my strats) you should buy an aimbot. It will help you win and everyone will talk about it. Make a video too and post it here, the developers will personally congratulate you on your win.",FortNiteBR

So I want to hear from you what is your preference, below is mine:  

# 1 - How I play in Solo Mode:  
I come from csgo(pc)/pubg(pc)/destiny(console) and I always have played aggressively in order improve my gun skills. 
Therefore, when I am top 10 on the zone, I know I will end up with a win (Of course I lost for more gun skilled players in that zone before, but I have high confidence because all the learning I've had).  
  
# 2 - How I play in Duo/Squads Mode:  
I try to push my team to be aggressive, many times they can’t as they don’t play much or have a more cautious style. When that is the case I slow down my game and try to be a team player. The problem when that happens is if one of my team mates is killed, we then have the other 2 team mates in panic, without a clue on how to fight a squad with all 4 players. It’s when being aggressive comes into play again and I try to finish off at least 2 of those 4s by flanking from different angles, that way the confidence of the team builds up and we can keep pushing for the win.  
  
# 3 - I stream:  
Another big reason is that I am a streamer, and it's very boring to my viewers to see anyone camping, when I could just jump into action.
So now (without being hateful to any play style ma dudes), as we know it's a survival game and only the last man standing is the winner, what is your best strategy?",FortNiteBR

As someone who is a very competitive person and is on the fence right now between FortniteBR and PUBG, this is the one thing that is stopping me from completely switching over.

There have been way too many times where I've either survived a flank attack because my opponent had bad luck with his spray, or I've died because I've had bad luck with my spray. The only weapons that feel consistent right now are the scoped rifle, the snipers, and the shotguns. And the scoped rifle is so much better than any other rifle at medium-long range that it's pretty ridiculous. I mean, amazing first shot accuracy, a scope, AND hitscan? It's insane.

In no particular order:


1. Always check under the stairs when entering a building/room unless you're the first person to land there. So many times I've heard somebody stomping around and I quickly Harry Pottered my way into getting a free kill by waiting until their back is turned and leaping out from my makeshift bedroom under the stairs.

2. On the subject of stomping, you can run while crouched to make less noise but still move quickly. If you're in a building, you're basically telling people to come and shoot you if you're running around willy nilly.

3. Don't engage unless you're sure you or your squad can kill them. I'd say this is particularly more important in squads since their teammates can be hidden closeby, but it's also important in solo as they might have a better weapon than yours, a bigger shield or just generally a better aim.
Sure, you can injure them to potentially make a later interaction easier or to help somebody else kill them later, but if they can get away they're probably going to bandage up and maybe even track you after you give your position away.

4. If you see a player-made door, don't go through it unless you know what's on the other side. I've got this fun little trick where I build a wall with a door at the top of the stairs in one of the houses in Retail Row. 
I then sit up in the attic looking down and when the trespasser stops to open the door, I just unload into them. It's even more fun when you have a trap on the other side and they just walk straight into it after opening the door.

5. On the subject of traps, pay attention to the sounds. The spike trap doesn't make a noise, but the zappy wall and ceiling features do. Even late game they can be useful, if to do nothing but make tresspassers take a slightly wider berth when trying to sneak into your final shelter.
If you have a spare second, put one down/up and you're protecting yourself and potentially getting a free kill. 

6. This one is a bit more obvious, but if you need cover, just build it. It may take a second, but it'll save you for at least a few more seconds.


TL;DR: 

Expelliarmus, crouching is fun, don't poke the bear, knock knock jokes, bear traps are not hats, build a better world.

I may add to this when I wake up,  but it's pretty late now and I need to sleep. ",FortNiteBR

Feels like initial shots don't go center.,"I'm a veteran to games like Unreal Tournament, Gears, and in the last few years over 1500 hours in another free to play shooter named Dirty Bomb.

I've never played an Unreal Engine game that even if I crouch and target (aim down sight), often even the first shots out of my weapon are still not going where my center dot is aimed.

 In every other Unreal game I've played....even where spread was a large part of gun play...the first shots out of your gun where usually near center...and then spread increases. In this game, even if I burst fire, crouch, or zoom target...the bullets don't seem like they go where they should.

Is this buggy and intended to be fixed....or is this developer design? I feel like this game doesn't reward me for having good aim unless I'm using a scoped weapon. 

I just started playing this game and am still feeling it out....but it's the first time I've played a shooter and felt like my aim wasn't being accurately represented by what's on screen. I kind of feel like there's no reward for having superior aim to your opponent when using non-scoped weapons.

I'm writting this today after reading /u/CougarForLife post [about character creator](https://redd.it/74hk9z). I've read almost all the comments, and I think nobody wrote about what I'm about to write so, sorry in advance if it's the case!

---

That being said, here's the idea~

For people who don't know, the characters you randomly get when you play Battle Royale are all Soldiers from the PvE part of Fortnite. 

As you probably noticed, there are **8 different heroes** (4 female and 4 male). They are all based on the same skeleton, and they are all wearing the same outfit. The only things changing is the skin color, the face and the haircut. This means that we already have in the game, for the same skeleton, **4 skin colors, 4 faces and 4 haircuts, for each gender**. In PvE, all heroes also have a rarity and a subclass, illustrated with different color themes for their outfit. 

Here's an [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/Cdxek) with all of the Soldier heroes~

---

**What if we could mix up all of these elements?**

Like I said, the skeleton is the same, so what if we could give our female character, for example, dark skin color, with the ""freckle-face"", the haircut with sunglasses and blue shirt? That could give [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/b7WCcvL.png).

We could have the [""asian face"" with long hair, darker color skin and red outfit](https://i.imgur.com/DuxlQ9V.png), the [""hollywood beard"" with spiky haircut, light skin and khaki green outfit](https://i.imgur.com/jVtTWOs.png), etc. there's a ton of possibilities!

We couldn't change the size of our character because we need to keep the same skeleton, but I feel like it could be enough for character creation~

What do you think?

I've had matches won with 1 kill, full stealth, Metal Gear all the way. I've had squad games won through ridiculous battles of attrition, finishing with 11 kills and 3 health. I've won by building a bridge into the sky, letting my friend snipe the guy that really deserved to win (we watched him kill 5 people in the last two circles and throw up a pretty impressive fort in about 30 seconds). I've won games that played out like a siege, fighting against 2 other teams in massive forts, while maintaining our own, praying to god that the storm doesn't push me and my friends into no man's land. Or my personal favorite strategy as of late, pushing fast and hard to the center of the circle, then sweeping outward trying to find teams to ambush, until we have the best loot of 5-6 teams to fight and build with in the end game. My point is, I think what makes this game so great, and different from other BR games, is that their are many, MANY ways to play, and all of them are equally viable if you know how to use them.

So I want to share it at least, even you dont have issues atm, I'd suggest at least to give a try.

1. Head to C:\Program Files\D:\Epic\Fortnite\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping
2. Right-click to properties on ""FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping"" 
3. Navigate to Compatibility -&gt; check the ""override high DPI scaling behaviour"" box, and hit ""OK"". (Application from drop-down menu)
4. Restart your game if necessary.

And now you should have greatly higher FPS, without making graphics look any worse AT ALL! - This also works with other games if you are having performance issues and know your hardware should run it better than that.

For me, I had 65-75 FPS at starter island before game start, but now it is around 90. I changed zero graphic settings and it's completely legal. Its a thing widows do on some fullscreen apps that cause performance loss.

I've probably spent about 20 minutes in the actual game, and most of that time was spent tweaking settings, when it comes to actual gameplay I've probably spent about 5 minutes actually running around and shooting people. To think I'd be cheating already is absurd.

I went to the Fortnite Discord channel to see if anyone had any answers there, I know a lot of EPIC staff are in there, but was kicked out for pointing out a flaw in the system.

All I said was that even though I'm banned, I'm still able to join games, and it's only once I leave the Battle Bus the game removes me from the server, so if I join team games it leaves my team at a disadvantage.

That was literally it, they kicked me for that, after banning me for nothing.. I've used my EPIC account to play Unreal Tournament for over a year without a hiccup, but 20 minutes into Fortnite and all of this has happened.

Tried making a new account but that just instantly got banned too.

That said, I noticed yesterday that when you down a player, they seem to be immune to further damage for 1-2 seconds. I don't know if this is intentional, or if this is an issue with server desync, or if it's a bug. 

If it's an intentional immunity, this should be made more obvious to the players. I'm not opposed to freshly-downed players having a short window to try and escape from their own death, I just want to be able to tell when I can start shooting at them so I don't waste time and ammo laying into a guy that is invincible.

If it's an issue with desync, then I'm alright with this as well. I understand that server issues and latancy are difficult to overcome and are largely unavoidable. I'll just have to learn to adapt to that and wait a few seconds before shooting.

If it's a bug, I'd obviously want to bring it to the attention of the developers so they can investigate and resolve the issue.

I'm sure I'm not the only one that has noticed this weird problem with killing downed enemies. Anyone else have any ideas?",FortNiteBR

Blog link [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/battle-royale-cheaters).

&gt; Let’s be straight for a second, nobody likes playing with cheaters. Not you, not me. Nobody.   
&gt; &amp;nbsp;  
&gt; We play PvP games like Fortnite Battle Royale for their competitive integrity. That feeling of outshooting somebody in an intense standoff and snagging that Victory Royale! And then there are cheaters, the 360-spin instant headshot, we all know so well.   
&gt; &amp;nbsp;    
&gt; *But what is Epic doing about it?*   
&gt; &amp;nbsp;    
&gt; To start, addressing cheaters in **Fortnite** is the **highest priority** across Epic Games. We are constantly working against both the cheaters themselves and the cheat providers. And it’s ongoing, we’re exploring every measure to ensure these cheaters are removed and stay removed from Fortnite Battle Royale and the Epic ecosystem. We don’t want to give too many clues about what we’re doing, but we are rolling out tools and will continue to do so. Thousands have been banned and we have no plans to stop!  
&gt; &amp;nbsp;    
&gt; **Account Progression**
&gt; 
In the next several weeks we’ll also roll out progression. Account progression means that you will earn stuff as you play. And it’s not just for fun - it will also help in the war against casual Cheaters and will give them less incentive to simply cheat their progression with a ban around the corner! For those persistent trolls, we’ll be continuing to work on solutions.
&gt; 
&gt;

I want to see the game succeed and that means a thriving, competitive, hack-free community on PC.

You might say it'd be bad PR to take a game that was supposed to be F2P and slap a price tag on it, but I'd say it was brilliant to release as F2P, get everyone hooked (I had such an easy time talking my friends into trying it, since there was nothing to lose), and then charge a reasonable amount so that people can keep enjoying the game without worrying about aimbotters making endless free accounts to evade the banhammer. I've already gotten WAY more than $20 worth of enjoyment from the game - hell, more than a lot of $60 games I've bought (cough, destiny 2) - and I bet a lot of other people feel the same way. Some of my friends are already talking about buying cosmetics (or even the iffy PvE mode) to support the devs, and $20 isn't much to ask for such an addictive game.

Obviously they'd have to sweeten the pot a little, especially for us console players, but if they, say, ""left early access"" and dropped an awesome new map or two and some cool new weapons at the same time it became a $20 game, I'd be hitting that purchase button so hard my hand might break.

_ Slower fire rate than any pistol


_ Same accuracy


_ Less ammo



It's really frustrating considering the actual range of accuracy for the revolver is so close that you will get shotguned pretty much on all fights....



Can we get more accuracy for the revolver ? I feel like headshots are really cool and rewarding in the game, would love the feeling of one tapping people at medium range, let's say a little closer than AR range but definitly more than semi-auto pistol.



So far fortnite hasn't made the slightest mistake in gameplay apart from a bit more accuracy and even so I see them working on it, so that would be cool ! Thanks.

Feel free to lynch me but first hear my story. I'm no asshole. I never intentionally shot my teammate in any game but this was different. We were playing squad - me, my two friends and one random guy. Usually the random guy goes his own way and dies or goes with us and is helpful. This one however was a devil incarnate. He looted everything. Every gun and every ammo we came across. When we were fighting he was already on his way to loot the corpses. He was reckless, whenever we had an advantage he ruined it by shooting in the air and alerting the enemy of our position. Long story short he was a terrible teammate and we were running out of ammo. One of my friends said ""What if we just kill him."" out of pure despair. We walked into some sort of tunnel and all stopped. Random guy stopped aswell with what I knew was an innocent look. I blasted my shotgun into his face just a splitsecond later. Executing the poor bastard with next shot. We looted a lot of ammo afterwards that guy was packed. My friends just went with a laugh about it but it really stuck in my mind. I did the dirty job I killed him and I believe it was for our team. If the two guys werent my friends just a two other random with similar idea I would be the executioner aswell. But there is this bitter feeling of treason that I feel on my left click. If only there was a chat. If only we had a chance to solve it non lethally. What about you? Would you kill him? Or let him sabotage your chances.

I understand people on pc want to play with their mates on xbox/ps4, which is why they should allow ps4/xbox players to join PC lobbies, therefore putting nobody at a disadvantage but the console player choosing to play with a mate. 

I put plenty of hours on pc into shooters back in the day and i know how much better it is for performance using a keyboard/mouse which is going to ruin the game for people on console, especially with all these reported hackers on PC.

 So just because of PC players being able to join my game, i can now potentially run into the same bullshit hacks everyone on PC is complaining about on this subreddit. Allow console players to join pc lobbies if they wish, but dont let PC players join console lobbys for easier competition or to hack. 

I might be completely wrong and be concerned over nothing so if someone could fill me in thats great, but from what i can tell PC players can join console lobbies, creating a significant disadvantage for even the best players, and a unneccessary risk of hacks.

- **Drop stuff on the ground as bait.** If you're hiding a bush and drop your blue AR or purple sniper close by, you will attract victims. Once you get the first one, you'll have a nice pile of loot that will look less suspicious than one good weapon

* **Bushes on hills work better.** A bush on flat ground won't hide the top of your head very well. A bush on a steep incline will make you impossible to see. The direction you face also influences how high up your head sticks out.

- **The Asian character and the chick with red hair are the worst for bush strat.** The Asian dude is super tall with spiky hair, and the red hair chick's ponytail sticks up pretty high

- **Bandaging puts you in super stealth mode.** When you bandage, your character lowers their head and you go totally invisible. With some practice you can constantly cancel your bandaging and stay like this in a pinch. Ideal for flat ground bushes where you aren't well hidden

- **Patience and self-control is key.** If you don't need loot, you don't have to blow your cover shooting. I've died far too many times with great gear because I killed a dude and got sniped by someone else.

That being said, the addition of supply drops made me realize that I think there is one particular PUBG feature which could be incorporated in a very fun way: the Red Zone. In PUBG, a red circle periodically appears in a random location on the map. Shortly after it appears, the indicated area begins to receive artillery shelling, making it incredibly dangerous to stay in the area if you're not indoors.

For Fortnite, I don't think shelling works. First, it doesn't fit the tone of the game. Second, getting ""indoors"" is a lot easier in Fortnite than it is in PUBG, since you can just build your own shelter, so the pressure mechanic doesn't really work the same.

However, what Fortnite DOES have is zombie-generating portals. I think this would make a fantastic mechanic for Battle Royale. Imagine: You're out in the middle of nowhere, hiding in a bush and waiting to snipe some poor fools, when suddenly your mini-map turns red (or purple or whatever) and spiraling purple clouds appear all over the surrounding fields. Now, you have 15-20 seconds to make a decision: Build a fort to keep the zombies out? Run and gun your way out of the red zone? Get to high ground and hide away from the zombies, then try to snipe other players who are trying to fight through the horde? It would add an interesting tactical element, even for players who try to avoid contact with other players. In addition, it has the potential to introduce interesting wrinkles for campers, especially if it happens to occur during end-game. What do you do if you've got a perfect metal fort built for that last showdown...and then a pair of zombie portals appears in the middle of it? Do you stay in the fort and fight the zombies in close quarters, or jump out and take your chances outside with your opponent(s)?

Now I’m sure most of you can agree that it’s so damn frustrating to get gunned down 1-2 minutes, sometimes immediately, at the beginning of the match but it’s also extremely boring for me to loot isolated places and not have a gun fight for what seems an eternity. After coming across two supply crates earlier today and looting them I have become a much more active player. They almost force me to land somewhat isolated, grab a gun/chest and start running inland. Before the risk/reward just wasn’t there but now it’s almost a sizeable risk to just go looting mainly isolated places. 

Just a tad bit of advice, try your best to find some high ground above a supply drop and just chill out while watching for other players who are going for it. Always check other surrounding hills as well. ",FortNiteBR

I really appreciate Epic sharing their philosophy of how they want to address gun balance. It shows a deep understanding of the mechanics hanging in the balance, and really instills some confidence that any changes will be handled with a delicate touch. 

Gun balance has been a pretty big topic for debate here, and it's very nice to see Epic looking for a middle ground, especially without making any radical changes. Looks like they have some great ideas, and have already been doing some behind the scenes testing.

Adding a PTR is a great way to allow them to make these big changes without stirring up too much drama, and getting feedback from the playerbase. Glad to see thwm going in this direction

I just want to extend my thanks to the guys at Epic for being so methodical and clear about everything. Also a thank you to all the players who remain patient about any issues they have with this otherwise fantastic game.  ",FortNiteBR

I didnt have any good guns or I would have shot lol.

These are just my ideas and if they are trash let me know instead of downvoting!

1. **Get too many resources!** if youre building to the sky, you need a lot of resources to follow and stay inside the circle. I prefer at least 400 of each resource, or you can spread it out, but tue more the better.

2. **wait until the 3rd circle to start building.** the first few circles are too large and will waste wayyyy too many resources just trying to stay inside the new circles.

3. **Follow the slowest part of the circle.** if you dont know, the point where the storm is closest to the new circle will be the slowest point, so if you need to follow the circle to that point.

4.**Dont just build ramps and platforms!** make sure you stick to the circle with your building, a huge platform is a lot more obvious than 1 platform sticking outside of the circle. This is where tip 3 comes in, as you can build slowly to stay with the moving circle.

5. **Use your stronger materials last! Once you are spotted, most people will try to shoot the spots near you, and the wood you used to ascend will be too far in the circle to see.

6. ** don't draw attention to yourself!** if you start shooting when there are 10 people left, odds are that one of them will realize where the bullets are coming from. Wait until there are like one or 2 more people left and line up a good shot.

These are pretty much what I did, and it would have been much easier if I had any good guns. You can see everyone building and peeking over the tops of their bases. Even though I didnt win I still had a blast!

Thanks for the read, if you have anything to add, or any criticisms, let me know!

Step 3:

In Engine file paste this:

r.DepthOfField.MaxSize=0

In GameUserSettings paste this:

r.DistanceFieldAO=0

(under the ,,[ScalabilityGroups]"" section) (should look like this: http://prntscr.com/gt5j2t )

Step 4: Turn on the game. DoF should be disabled

If dont work go to EpicGames launcher, go to config (near start the game button) and scroll down to: ,,Additional command line arguments"" (or something like this) and paste this line there:

So heck i'll just put it on here.

Since building is such a big part of this game uniqueness, why not do more with it?
I'm talking blueprints.. Lootable blueprints that can be found in the world.
Blueprints that allow you to quickly place a small house, and bigger designs. Also sniper towers small and big, stuff like that.
Ofcourse still allowing free build, and even editing the blueprints to your liking or expand on them.

This would make the building compenent even more interesting and a top of that it would add more lootables to the loot table!

It might be a weird idea, but I just wanted to suggest it because personally I would really like it if they implemented this.\

EDIT: To elaborate further, balancing could be done through,
Controlling the drop rate.

Let's say there are 50 chests in the world, this is a guess but I don't expect there to be ALOT more.
And let's say there is a droprate of 1/10 CHESTS will have possibility of dropping one. with a rarity ranging from uncommon(wood) to epic(metal)
This would get to a total of 5 structures in total being build end game at max.
Not considering possible losses by death and not being looted etc. so a MAX of 5 structures. 

And as suggested by somebody else, for further balancing can be done by putting uses on them(or putting it more specificly 1 use), this makes it so that it also becomes a strategic choice on when to use them. 

Secondly, resource cost. 
You could increase the cost, to like let's say double the worth. I don't know if this is necessarily needed since we all know how destructible wooden walls are and such. And let's not forget that destroying a foundation of any building completely destroys the whole.
In the end they will not be spammable anyways since these blueprints will be single use only, only differing in rarity which will affect material and design.

I just think that putting blueprints in will complement the building system alot more than it does now.
At this point people are just spamming walls and stairs to actually create things these blueprints could be.
But nobody actually uses balcony's or such because it's not time efficiënt. 
Balancing should be thought about ofcourse but there's enough to be worked with.

Remember the numbers i'm using are only suggestions, this could be thought over alot to create a fun and nice balance.

i'm writing this post in order to share what info i found out about the state of cheating in the game -**After a chat with the moderators** i'll keep it vague when i can in order not to make it actually easy for more people to start hacking .

wanted to share the little info i gathered from having a look around the cheating forums (keep in mind these are free cheats available for all to download i have no clue what will be available as premimum payed hacks down the line )

***1 : state of cheats***

people have a couple of ESP ( wallhacks ) and headshot aimbots available for free - they claim to be undetected but that does not really matter because cheaters have a couple accounts and get them unbaned really easily (thats key here more on that later )

it seems that most of the 'important stuff' is server side, but they still made strong enouth cheats to ruin the game **some only use a zero recoil / perfect accuraly cheat and other use a full aimbot** some get to see gold cheats through walls 

***2 : state of bans*** 

now more importantly - my first post ( now removed ) included some very important info about the bans going on rigth now : **long story short they are ineffective** : we dont have any real hardware or ip bans going on so cheaters can just edit / remove something in the registery and keep playing as if nothing happened there is no need to even get a new account 


i have no idea how the devs can use that info (im sure they allready know about and have those cheats)

i'm just hoping for a fast response from them - i like seeing people betting banned but we are too fast to celebrate bans are meaningless right now and you'll get more and more cheaters soon as they improve on the cheats everyday.



as a counter strike player i'll like to add i'm very open to having a **stong, invasive anti cheat on my machine** - its a free game you can make it how you want it to be

Make it so that the first shot from all guns is 100% Accurate, then increase spread the faster you fire. This will make it so that you can tap fire and consistently get hits from mid- long range, but you can’t hold down fire at any range except close range if you want to consistently get hits. This would make the game more skill and aim based rather than rng based, and would encourage precise shots at mid to long range rather than spamming as much as you can attempting to get a hit.",FortNiteBR

The first one has 2 and a half minutes, which is nice and then the second one, which also is the biggest reduction of playground, has only a minute and half. 

Too many times that circle forces to run from fights to reach the circle or when you can't get out of a fight and go on for around a minute - you're fucked again if the circle is half across the map.

The second circle is the time a lot of people get into fights as well. If you gotta run half way across the map you're bound to find enemies but you can't fight them otherwise you'll die to the circle. 

Ridiculous in my opinion. Give us more time to reach the circle or don't make it as drastic of a contraction. It really is bad. ",FortNiteBR

It seems that too few people are playing this game now, Europe is not even worth it (anymore?)

EDIT:
They have officially stated that there should be european servers:
&gt;We are currently running dedicated servers in Virginia (USA) and Frankfurt (Germany). Our infrastructure allows us to fairly easily spin up servers in other regions once a certain population threshold has been reached to ensure a good matchmaking experience.

First &amp; foremost, I really like this game, especially considering it's FTP. Since downloading this game I haven't played Overwatch more than once or twice. So, any criticism I may have shouldn't be viewed as ""hating,"" but rather just constructive observations!

1.) When I win a BR, it is SO SO SO satisfying. That surge of adrenaline, that euphoric feeling, it is SO great. Winning BR's is perhaps the most satisfying thing I've experienced whilst gaming. And I LOVE how 2nd place STILL feels like a GIGANTIC loss.

2.) I've got 8 wins (I take pictures of my #1's lol) in about 60-75 matches, and I noticed a distinct pattern. One (or more) of the following criteria needs to be met: I have legendary weapon (2/2 when finding legendary weapon)  ///   I have the purple semi-auto sniper /// or I have full shields and blue &amp; green weapons. Basically, there is ""win-conditions"" for me in this game, but it actually doesn't bother me at all. If I'm not meeting my ""win-conditions"" at any point during a map, then I decide to be more aggressive and try to hi-jack other people lewts!

3.) The difference/performance between grey &amp; orange weapons MIGHT be too steep of a difference. Yes, finding a orange weapon SHOULD be exciting, but finding grey one's is kind of disappointing lol. (EDIT: Many people are saying the difference between orange and grey guns isn't very drastic. In some cases, with certain guns, I agree. However, with the full-auto AR, I disagree. I have recordings of myself fighting people at THIRTY YARDS, tap-firing, cursor/target RIGHT on their chest, and just MISS MISS MISS MISS.) 

4.) Picking a efficient flight-path off the bus is VERY important. It seems every-other map some guy lands in my house 30 seconds after me and gets 294 shotgun pellets to his face!

5.) I kind of wish the noise that I make (while crouching &amp; crawling) was a bit softer or not included in the audio. Countless times I've heard something that makes me think someone is close, and it turns out to just be my own sounds lol.

6.) Another thing I love is how IMMERSED I become while playing this game. I'm SURE I'm not the only one who has experienced this: Only a few people left, you're slowly crouching through the high-grass, everything appears to be safe &amp; quiet. You are looking off into the distance because you thought you saw something move about 200 yards away when....WHAM WHAM WHAM! Some guy just burst out from behind a tree, shotgun blazing, kills you &amp; made you JUMP out of your chair! I LOVE It!

In almost every win or loss I've taken in the final circles, every Squad or Solo player has built a base. The only counter is to build a base yourself and have a stare off, or blow it up.

I like the building aspect of this game, but players should be able to react to their base being destroyed. If someone is launching RPGs at you, then put shots into them instead of sitting there spamming wall after wall.

If someone has that many rockets, 99% of the time they earned it by killing other players while you were farming resources. You don't just find 30 rockets laying on the ground.

This game is great by the way and it's in beta. Can't wait to see what's in store for this one.

**EDIT: Well apparently you can use the RPG like a rocket launcher from Halo 3.

FIRST PERSON MODE
They said they have no plans at this stage to add it. For further clarification there is an option in the pve mode to go first person but you cant see you gun at all so they haven't made a proper first person camera view yet.

because banned cheaters can make new free accounts really easily, FBR would really benefit from a system like this. a phone number can only be linked once and the phone number must come from a carrier (cannot use VoIP numbers like Google voice)

edit: some users have raised concerns over people that don't have phones. the verification doesn't have to be mandatory. enabling verification would allow players to only play with other verified players. yes in theory, this would screw people that don't have phones by forcing them to play unverified cheaters, but this population would account for less than 2% of the player base.",FortNiteBR

A) they don't have a squad they can actually communicate with and have even basic tactics 
B)they just throw all common sense out of the window or 
C) they just don't care about winning (kill hunting etc.). 

It just seems that with a couple other players you can actually communicate with, winning is not very difficult if you have common sense and are at least competent with the aiming and gunplay. Are there any other reasons that are keeping people from winning (besides cheating and the occasional MLG Pro Squad)? 

If you have any questions or are looking for any tactics, I can try and help,and while I wouldn't say I'm a great player by any means, I have won eight of my last ten squad matches (and a good number before that as well).

https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/6os6ov/here_is_how_to_disable_mouse_acceleration/

&gt;This game has mouse acceleration on by default and forces it back on if you disable it. Why any pc game developer would do this is beyond me. To fix this you want to go to %LOCALAPPDATA%\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient and edit GameUserSettings.ini with notepad or some other text editor. You'll want to find ""bDisableMouseAcceleration=False"" and change it to ""bDisableMouseAcceleration=True"". After this save the file and then right-click the file, go to properties and make it read-only. Now launch/relaunch the game, figure out your wanted sensitivity again, remove read-only from the file, go back to the game, turn some random setting on/off and apply to update the file, go back to the file, turn mouse acceleration off again, and finally make the file read-only again.

On day 2 of the game's public release a wallhack was created via this tool which read UE4 games' memory. It was passed around like hot cakes for free. However it was causing lag but it still worked.


The 3rd day of the release a couple of paid cheat websites had already created working aimbots, with auto shoot, no recoil, these over powered cheats however they were very rare because they were not free.


Day 3-4 people created buggy aimbots via the memory reading tool. They worked for some, not for others but legit players could win vs these players none the less. This was the free version.


This then evolved overtime and improved and then we get to today. An aimbot nearly equivalent to the overpowered paid aimbot was released publicly.  This aimbot lets them 1 shot you with pistols across the map. There is no bullet drop for them, no recoil etc. The people saying ""we can win squad vs cheaters"" haven't really faced this cheat yet. It will wupe your 5 man squad with every weapon/perk before you will see him.


Here's the worst part. This current aimbot has not widely spread yet. Its still rotating in closed circles and has not been approved on the main forums where the masses hunt. When it does this game will be 20x more unplayable than it is now. It is currently pending approval so basically the end is near.


&gt; *""But I don't see cheaters I guess I'm lucky"".*


There's two possibilities. 


- #1 :  You played vs the old shitty cheat, you will face the real cheat in every match starting tomorrow.


- #2 : You already had 10+ wall hackers every game and you couldn't tell because they don't have the skill. An aimbot resolves that problem for them. They will now switch to this OP aimbot.


Currently on the server there are about 10 wall hackers, 89 legit players and 0-1 aim botter with the working aimbot.


These wallhackers will now ALL convert into the aimbotters. You will get 5+ every game, no chance of winning. 


As time goes on these cheats will only get stronger. What you see today is nothing. You can make them so much more powerful and they are free and publicly available.


The devs need to make an anti-cheat. What you have today is nothing. You are playing in the best version of the game cheaters wise if an anti-cheat isn't added. 

A deterant has to be added. They will evade all IP, HW, account bans as long as the game is free.

**Edit : The cheat has been approved on the big forums now. GG**

They also track player behind buildings or terrain perfectly. Their favourite weapons are hitscan (rifle/pistol) and all of them never hit a single bullet with the sniper since it's not hitscan.

Almost none of them even cares to build walls and all of them have pretty bad mechanics and movement. I saw someone killing people over 200m with a tec9 which has such a bad accuracy that it's not human possible to even hit every bullet over 50m. I'm pretty sure all of them use the same cheat, which is a ESP+Aimbot. Since the bullet registration is client-side, the cheat can manipulate the accuracy and hit targets aslong as they are in line-of-sight.

- Avoid engaging people early/mid game if you can. There's little benefit to doing so, as usually people haven't picked up many good items right away. You also run the risk of losing armor/health which you may not be able to restore.

- Try landing in the abandoned/run down houses and near bridge entrances. These are usually loaded with 3-4 guns, bandages, armor, etc. They are usually overlooked as landing spots. But you fully gear up there with little difficulty.

- If you like all the weapons you have and you want to quickly pick up ammo/bandages/etc without swapping out your weapons, just switch to pick axe and spam the pick up key over the loot pile

- Hiding in large bushes is surprisingly effective

- Don't bother crawling around if you're using a shotgun. Being crouched puts you at the perfect height to be headshot. If you're engaging with a shotgun, being sneaky really doesn't matter. Even if you fire the first shot you're probably going to get hit at least once, and getting hit crouched is usually really bad.

- Always keep track of the storm. Always make sure you're at least halfway to the safe zone before a storm starts. This will give you enough time to run to safety. Avoid combat if possible as safety is priority.

- Always keep moving. Don't camp out in a house for 2 minutes doing nothing. You should always be actively trying to find better loot. Otherwise you aren't making good use of your time. I've never won a game where I camped a spot early/mid game because even if I survive to late game I'm usually underpowered and without resources.

- Learn where chests are and actively seek them out. This goes along with the previous tip... but I feel like people underestimate the value of chests.

- Gather at least 100 of each building resource by late game

- Staying just on the outer edge of the safe zone and moving around it is a good way to make it to late game. Having the storm to your back usually means you only have to worry about enemies in front or to your side

- Try to have one shotgun, one mid range rifle and one sniper rifle at all times

- Use armor packs immediately (as soon as you can safely do so) Holding them is pointless (unless you have maxed armor) and if you die you'll just be giving free armor to your killer

- When the circle is getting smaller and there are 10-15 people left, I tend to build small 3 level high towers near the edge of the safe zone. This lets you catch people running from the storm and also survey the remaining safe area. Building dead center of the safe zone is typically not a great idea because you are making yourself a target and can be attacked from all directions

- If you can let the remaining players fight each other while you wait... do this. Don't get trigger happy when you see two players fighting each other, even if one of them is an easy target. Let one kill the other, then go in for the kill.

- Adding to the previous point... when you hear a gun fight happening, it can sometimes be beneficial to run to it. You might catch the winner of that fight when they are low health or picking up loot. Free kill and all the loot from the battle is a good motivator to run TOWARD gunfire.

- If you're actively running from loot spot to loot spot and finding it empty, use those clues to deduce that someone was probably recently there and may be just ahead of you. Rush forward to the next closest loot spot and be prepared to jump the person.


That's just some that I could think of. Any other first place finishers please feel free to share your tips as well, or critique my tips. :)",FortNiteBR

**Snipers:**

Being projectile means they take a bit more skill, patience, and luck.

Do you prefer the bolt action o the semi auto? While the bolt does more damage but requires reload after each shot, the semi auto can fire more rapidly. But with the snipers being projectile, is this even an actual advantage? 

**Submachine guns**

People never go to squad markers. They never shoot the purple and gold guns they horde. They never revive. They don't build.

I don't know how to correctly phrase my thoughts, but I'll try to be clear and straight to the point.

I believe that falloff could be the solution the current gunplay needs. The non-existence of damage falloff is kinda weird to me.
Three shots from a Rare M16 is enough to kill ( no shield ). I do not mind this a close range, but at long range, I think this shouldn't do this much damage. I don't like the tactic of "" shooting at this guy 400 meters away and hope to hit him "".

Falloff is a very good balancing tool. A good way to even out the currently asked better precision of weapons.

The SMG ( Common ) damage is 10. It's garbage. A SMG should be deadly at close range. It should be the middleground between shotguns and rifles. Giving it ~23 damage but a quick falloff would make them way more usable.

Falloff would also force players to get closer from each other.

**No damage falloff for snipers,** obviously, the player should be rewarded for hitting a long range shot.

I was thinking of a maximum falloff of either 50% or 33%. A max range shot from a Uncommon M16 would deal 16 or 11 damage, for example. 

So here is my opinion on what falloff could potentially bring to the gunplay.

What do you guys think ?

I think it would be nice if there were semi-rare to rare drops for upgraded pickaxes that would increase the farm/destruction speed of objects, increase the material gain from destroying those objects, and perhaps a damage increase for melee swings. Other Battle Royale style games have multiple melee weapons, and while you start out in FN:BR with a basic pickaxe, I think it would be nice to have a pickaxe that is actually useful for more than just breaking stuff.

Also a Revive icon would be nice too, to show how many teammates you revived in game. Maybe have the icon a health cross? And when you win or loose, to have a Box Score show up what you and your teammates did in that particular game. Depending on your productivity it can also lead to how many in game currency (future addition) for cosmetic items perhaps?

It would increase the mobility of everyone without needing to implement vehicles. 

Using it would make you vulnerable to ground fire with no way to fire back, and also give away your position so people would still have to be cautious.

I simply needed a place to dump my thoughts on what would be cool (regardless of it already being mentioned) to add. Some of these suggestions I've already seen in the subreddit, some of them I have not. I apologize for repeat suggestions. If anyone has any thoughts on these please comment! I'd like to hear feedback and see if anyone else is interested in these ideas.

* Vehicles - Small go-karts or other goofy vehicles to go with the games aesthetic. SLIGHTLY faster than sprinting. 1-2-4 seaters. (Something akin to Mario Kart) 

 * Edit: Some people seem to be mistaken when I say Mario Kart. I mean tiny vehicle like a car that a toddler would ride, but a grown man is in instead. Something where your knees are tucked to your chest and elbows sticking out crammed inside. This could also be something like a unicycle or any other goofy vehicles.

* More Weather Effects - Rain, fog, snow, etc.

* Spectator Swapping - Ability to spectate anyone in your squad by rotating between them, not just one person.

* Character Selection - The ability to choose our character, not randomly picked each round.

* Cosmetics - Costumes/weapon skins for characters/weapons.

* Post-Game Rewards - Llama Pinatas to bash open after victories, or at least RNG chance at a Pinata dropping per game.

* Reticle Customization - The ability to change the color/shape of your weapon reticles (including the bloom indicator).

* Bloom Toggle - Ability to adjust light bloom from the sun and other light sources.

* More Trap Spawns - Increase the volume of traps that can spawn around the map.

* Squad Kill Counter - Add a kill counter to each name in your squad, similar to the one on your own HUD.

* Down Credit - Credit for downing someone, separate from killing. (Maybe mark as an assist)

* ADS Sensitivity - Separate setting for ADS.

* Aim Assist Toggle - Allow to toggle this off-on if this MUST stay in the game.

* Dead Player Loot - Spread out the love a bit more, too bunched up for easily picking things up. (Though this is mitigated by wielding the pick while looting so you don't pick up and swap out weapons/bandages/shield potions)

* Headshots Instakill - Allow a sniper rifle to instakill if delivering a headshot, but only if that damage exceeds their current health and their downed health. If the damage does not exceed the total 200 HP, then leave the difference as remaining downed health. (Shield would obviously be taken into consideration with this aswell, meaning someone at max shield would need to take 300 damage from a headshot to be insta-killed, if that's even possible. This same rule could apply to a direct impact from rocket launcher.)

* Grenade Range - Let me throw a grenade further, these biceps are not that of a toddlers!

* A Bow - Give us a bow that we can craft arrows from stone/wood. (These arrows could, if there is enough interest for it, be crafted with metal for metal tipped, or grenades for explosive arrows. Obviously increasing damage based on the route you go and giving a nice small splash damage effect.)

* Medkit Crafting - Ability to combine bandages into a medkit would be interesting.

* Ranked - Competitive ranked play with actual numbered ranks and a feeling of significance with wins/losses and K/D/A.

* Custom Games - Allow for custom lobbies for us to fool around in and test out various vantage points.

* New Map - Add a new map to the mix that's randomly chosen each time you play! Maybe one that's less rural, bigger towns/cities, overall more residential with skyscrapers. The current one will get stale after awhile (though I'm still loving it)

Edit: So far a lot of feedback! I dig it. I see and have come to agree with the points made about vehicles and crafting. Definitely might change the overall feel of the game in a way that would not be conducive to the current aesthetic. I will also be adding suggestions I see in the comments to this list. =]

 * Squad Map Arrow Colors - Squad arrows on map to match the diamonds by their names and health bars.

 * Empty Guns - Be able to empty bullets from guns into our pile of ammo in our pack.

 * Auto-Run - Allow us to toggle running on and off so that we can access inventory while running.

 * Ksevio suggested this below, fixed path vehicles. Such as trains/elevators/ski lifts.",FortNiteBR

1) Traps.  As traps currently stand, they are the most useless thing in the game.  They are far too small, much too noisey, and too difficult to place in a hurry.  I probably have over 30 hrs on BR at this point and have yet to see a single trap succeed.  Give us a trip wire esque trap (think Horizon Zero Dawn) that you can place outside, and it doesn't automatically kill its prey.  Maybe it makes them spill their loot all over the place.  Maybe it makes them show up on radar.  Maybe it immobilizes them for 10 seconds?  Setting up ambushes with your squad in a valley while the storm pushes people towards you would be the bees knees.

2)  Sprinting.  Right now, when you're sprinting you can look almost 90 degrees left and 90 degrees right without breaking your sprint.  I think sprinting players should be more susceptible to rushes by enemy squads on either side.  You could do this by locking a sprinting players camera directly ahead of them.

3)  Crouched walk.  The crouched walk should be even less noisey than it is right now.  Flanking enemy players is one of the most exciting plays in the game.  Encourage this tactic more often by making a crouched player even stealthier.

4)  Night.  The day night cycle right now is cool but it appears to be an aesthetic thing only.  It would make for more varied and interesting gameplay if there were some practical gameplay related impact that the night brought.  Maybe you shouldn't be able to see as far.  Maybee shadows should give player characters an opportunity to hide.  It doesn't have to be drastic, but squads and players should be able to say ""Well, it is night now so we should be able to _____.""  Make the night feel different than day time.  Oh and maybe make the day night cycle a little longer?  

5)  One special item per game.  I thought it might be interesting if there was one special gadget that spawned somewhere on the map each game that gave players who picked it up some kind of slight and interesting advantage.  Maybe it's a one time useinvisible camo.  Maybe it's a heartbeat sensor?  Maybe it's a 3 time use radar that stamps enemy locations on your mini map for a few seconds.  Maybe it's a digital decoy like the one Arnold used in Total Recall.  It might be interesting if you ran into something like this (by picking it up yourself, or by seeing an enemy use it) once every ten or twenty games.

6)  Smoke grenades.",FortNiteBR

That being said - I haven't won a single solo here yet but I have gone out with tons of kills every game (some not so much) and love the fact that I can just get in so fast, play, kill. It feels like the style and the momentum of this game really encourages for you to be always on the move, having fun.

I have found that if there is ever a slow moment (which there almost isn't) - you have time to actually start building, you are NEVER without something to do!

I am looking forward to the future of this game - the map design is really well done, and the flow is top notch.

I've no hard game stat sheets to work with, but I can tell you that the Assault Rifle does a solid 35-30 damage with low recoil, decent RoF, good accuracy, and good range. It's worlds apart from the SMG's, which do a laughable 10 damage even at closer ranges (and with bad recoil/constant reloads), and can outgun shotguns up close if they miss a shot or are more than a yard away. The sniper rifle is really difficult to use as anything more than a weapon to pick off unsuspecting player standing still, and can be outgunned by the assault rifle even at longer ranges due to a markedly higher RoF.

PS4 Fortnite Battle Royale,"So I know I should try to avoid many battles to win, but I can get into 2nd place, 3rd place or 4th place while getting 0 kills... Nope I never got into 1st place in solo that is because I’ll get sniped or blown up by a grenade launcher or rocket launcher... I swear this game is sexy af I love it, but yooooo it can piss me off to the point I wish I had the disc of this game so I could break the shit out of it and then regret it afterwards, but hey its free!

Anyways yes I have killed many people but not in 1 whole game. The most kills I got in 1 whole game was 7 kills, and it all had been the most cheesy of kills. All I did was hid in a bush, someone comes near me, then i strike em giving me the kill and the loot. Thats all I did in that whole game... which gave me 2nd place because I got sniped... from a bush... yes karma...

ALRIGHT TO THE POINT... So 2nd place was good enough for me which had me thinking 🤔 hm so I can survive well by avoiding battles, gun fire noises, and hiding in bushes. What if I could survive by facing my battles then maybe it could help me come in first place, and also give me the good loot that I need. So i attempted this which resulted in death, dead, died, ran, survived by dipping the scene with 7 health left... Not that I will get jumped by multiple people, its just one person, but everytime I shoot them like 50 times i get stuck in reloading which then leave me with 12 more bullets... and all they have to do is shoot me 4 or 5 times (SMG, AR, and Pistols no matter how far they are from me) to take my health from 100 to 10... then once im dead, I spectate the person that I was shooting over 50 times, he is left almost with 60 to 85 health left... (Without healing)

I hope im not ranting much but my question is, how do you kill people fast? Is it that my aim is bad, is it because im not shooting them in the right place, or am I using the wrong guns?...

Gun rarities:

Right now, the main difference between weapon tiers is how tight the bloom is. With guns being perfectly (or near perfectly accurate, what's the difference between a grey and blue m16. A grey and blue pistol? A purple and orange scar? Epic would have to develop new guns within each class of weapon to make them feel any different from one another. In lieu of the rarity system in place, we would be looking at more pistols, more ARs, more SMGs. Is it worth scrapping the entire rarity system for more accurate weapons?

Balancing Range:

Further than that, Epic would have to find another way to balance range. If all guns are accurate, what would stop you from sniping with a pistol? We now have to find a different way to make guns only work within an intended range. Noq we're at a point where Epic has to develop damage falloff values (where guns do less damage past certain ranges) for every gun. This way ARs are still the best at mid range, where pistols and SMGs would start to do less damage, and snipers would be the best at long range, where it would take many AR shots to net a kill.

Hitscan Snipers?

If all other guns are as effective at landing shots at range, the snipers wind up in a weird spot where they are the only gun that requires extra effort. While this may make the sniper one shots feel more balanced, they wouldn't feel like they have much of an advantage, considering it takes more time to line up a shot, and other guns can just hitscan you, with no concerns of missing a shot, to interupt your aiming. Do we now need snipers that are hitscan, or do we have to have other guns have a bullet velocity mechanic, and abandon hitscan shooting? Either way, that's more work for Epic, to fix something that, in my opinion, isn't broken.

Overall, i say that's a lot of development time spent, and all to make this game just feel more like PUBG. We don't need another clone.

I understand the frustration of missing shots and losing fights because of it. I'm all for tightening the spread a bit more so guns feel better,  and finding a way to make some of the less accurate guns more effective. (For example, I'd love to see SMGs not lose accuracy when on the move) I just hope that we can give the game some time, and learn the intricacies of this system in place, before we ask for a complete overhaul just to wind up with another samey feeling battle royale game.

TLDR: Making the guns too accurate leads to new balance issues such as rarities being useless, and range having no balance mechanic, and would ultimately cost a ton of developement time. If you've read through this monster of a post, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",FortNiteBR

The Zappers are a clear example: there's a big bright blue glow irradiating from them and a loud electrical buzz letting you know that a trap is set. This is OK with AI characters coming _en masse_, but not when a human is around.

They're very easy to detect and circumvent. There's no use, for example, in removing the walls around a Zapper it and replace them with steel or brick, which would conceal traps better (since there are less holes).

A perfect example of how traps should work in PVP is the spiked floor. Discreet and deadly, it will catch people off guard, exactly like a trap should.

**A trap is not a trap if it's not concealed**.

Utility ""traps"" are also a very interesting concept, but I personally haven't found use of them, other than escaping.

as a player with hundreds of games in this BR mode I just wanted to share my thoughts with you on some things.

First I want to say that this game is the only one I play atm. Before it came out, I played a lot of different games but with F:BR it changed - that is how good it is already.

I played alot of H1Z1 (over 1000h) and pubg (over 1000h) and while I enjoyed both, I always had the feeling that they are really unfinished and that I miss something in every single match.

When F:BR came out I played it and feeled so relaxed. There was basically no bug, no lag, no bad game experience in general!
That was completely new to me! 
I could enjoy it from minute one until now and I sure will enjoy it the next months.

Sure there are a couple of tweaks and features that are still missing, but nothing to great of a deal.

If I had to rate this game I would rate it 11/10 for sure. And it's free! A gamer dream come true!



**Here are my solo Q tips for newer players:** 

- in your first games get used to the pickaxe first; land in a less crowded area, use it and destroy some things to get used to it
- the pickaxe does 11 damage per hit to ppl; don't land and try to kill somebody pubg-style - go find a gun first
- hit the blue circle with your pickaxe to destroy things faster
- in your first games play around with the construction mechanic: build some stairs, walls and doors with different materials; it will win you games if you do so and loses you games if you don't; to make a door in your wall (PC): Q (for building) &gt; G (for editing) &gt; remove middle and bottom middle tile &gt; confirm = you made a wall with a door
- if you have to cross an open field in order to get to the safe zone and you get shot, don't try to reach cover like in pubg, BUILD IT! :) it is really fast to build a wall: just press Q and confirm with left mouse
- different material has different sturdiness with metal being the sturdiest followed by stone and wood
- different material has different building times with wood being the fastest followed by stone and metal
- you dont have to wait for a stair to be finished, just place it and you immediatelly can step on it even it is is still under construction!
- metal walls can absorb the most bullets before it breaks
- if you just build a wall its construction is'nt finished instant but it immediately blocks line of sight (somewhat), pathing and a couple of bullets or even a rocket; use that knowledge to protect you from heavy fire or to block the enemy from chasing you in buildings 
- you need 10 wood to build a single part of whatever you want
- always try to carry at least 100-200 wood since it is really easy to farm (trees, fences, etc)
- some objects are one-hit with your pickaxe! if you know which you can use that to your advantage in case you run from an enemy and have no gun and no ressources to wall him out of sight, try to destroy small one-hit-objects like a chair, big garage door, wooden fence, cupboard, cabinet, salad in fields or some other small object to generate 10 ressources fast and wall your enemy out of sight quickly
- use traps! try to find more than one trap and get used to it how you switch between them (for PC players the standard key bind to switch between floor and wall trap is: Q &gt; f5 &gt; T)
- be careful if you build stairs or buildings to highly - enemies can shot them and you will fall to death
- only sniper bullets have a travel time and bullet drop
- loot chests make a ""shiny"" noise! the closer you are the louder it gets; that way you can locate it even through walls!
- running makes the loudest noise, crouching without running the least noisy sound (good for sneaking)
- you can destroy EVERYTHING with your pickaxe AND with your guns and rockets and grenades; cover is only as good as the enemies explosives and bullets; use that to your advantage in gun fights 
- while dropping from the battle bus don't fly while looking to the horizon, it's not the fastest way to reach a far destination - try to drop in an 20°-30° angle instead
- if you want to reach a very far destination to loot open up your glider early, that way you can reach every point on the map regardless how far away it may be from the bus
- there are no ""best"" looting spots; you can get good loot in every single house on the map even if you drop in a single house somewhere in nowhere
- if you have trouble to loot a player: switch to your pickaxe and loot the bullets that way; you can't pick up guns when you have your axe out and wont switch guns
- running adds a little dusty graphic effect to you and everybody else can see it too! If you run on an open field a far distant player cant hear you but he can easily spot you because of that! try not to run all time or use cover to disguise the dust you make
- in nearly every house are ammo boxes! they are dark green and small; they are key to win in gunfights because you wont run out of ammo that fast; I always check buildings even if they are ""looted"" because everybody ignores the ammo boxes; it's kinda insane
- late game everybody builds a base... while sometimes its a good idea to do so I have the feeling that it is a giant ""throw explosives here""-sign to everybody; I won by far the most games without building a base but to use natural cover to disguise my position instead; I only build late game when I am in a situation of acute danger to safe my butt
- there is NO free look in this game! take advantage of that and sneak up on people! They DONT have eyes in the back :)
- you can drop bullets and bandages from your inventory to share it with friends
- JUMP in close combat gunfights and use a shotgun doing so!
- use the construction mechanic to confuse your opponent in town fights! if you get hunted build a stair to a roof and walk around a corner; your enemy now has to consider more optoins and you are more likely to win the hide and seek minigame
- if you chase an enemy through a town, try build stairs to get on rooftops and jump down the other side to cut of his path
- there is falling damage in the game so be careful 
- if you have to get of off a mountain fast, dont just hope to survive the drop, use your building mechanic and build stairs left and right while dropping down on them at the hillside; it is really fast and safe since your are somewhat protected if you get shot from above
- use bushes! they are really op!
- shoot to kill, not to fight! honstly I can understand if you want to have the most fun and action possible but if you want to win, dont shoot everything you see!!! even with the accuracy buffs to all assault rifles, they are still quite bad in long distance fights; usually you have only a few bullets at the start of the game, so use them wisely and only if you have a high chance of securing a kill to get more bullets
- somebody camps in a building? destroy it with explosives! he will regret his playstyle fast
- the fastest way to collect metal is cars and bridges but be careful destroying a metal object may be louder than destroying a tree!
- some cars have an alarm system! careful if you are not sure you are alone in that area
- orange &gt; purple &gt; blue &gt; green &gt; white is the quality of guns
- the higher the quality of a gun the more accurate the gun and ofc the higher the damage!
- you can't edit a structure created by an enemy 
- crouching without moving gives you the best accuracy
- moving while aiming will reduce your accuracy; more so, if you strafe on top of that
- Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher are quite rare. If you find one, keep it. Their value in late game situations is unbelievable!
- In some close combat situations your can rocket-kill an enemy with a rocket launcher and survive. To do so you need to shoot the ground behind your enemy. He is closer to the impact and will take way more damage and dies instantly - if you have a shield potion you are more likely to survive that obv
- high ground is really valuable; if the circle gets smaller try to build your way up on a hill and destroy the last two of your stairs behind you (maybe with a rocket); that way you have a huge advantage and can get down fast if needed 
- the burst rifle is stronger than you think in mid range fights!
- you CANT rocket jump in this game! FeelsBadMan
- if you are in the storm, the damage will cancel the loot animation!
- if you are in the storm, the damage will not cancel healing!
- if you are in the storm, you still can loot if you start the looting shortly after you took damage!!!
- shield potions will not protect you from the storm or falling damage
- try to move with the circle to avoid getting shot in the back
- use crouch moving as often as possible! 
- the scoped assault rifle has hit scan like all the other guns except sniper rifles - that is why the scoped AR is considered op at its current state
- sequisha has the most sexy stache on the twitch! check his stream on twitch if you want to see a really good F:BR player 

I really do hope EG will improve the game and listen to the community as they already do but some things should be left untouched or shouldnt be included.

**Things they should NEVER add:**

**Vehicles faster than a bicycle**
You read it right. I am not one of those players who is against vehicles entirely but if they add some they shouldnt be faster than a bicycle. Just a little faster (maybe 30%) than running speed.

**Free-look mechanic**
I know a lot of streamers and players want that but honestly: it would completely ruin this game!
Right now you HAVE to be really careful when you walk around or camp. You just can't run in one direction and look backwards to check your surroundings. If you want to do so you need to slow down a bit and actively turn around your cam.
The other aspect of a missing free-look mechanic is the fact that sneaking up on somebody is actually possible. If you ever change that, people are more likely to camp without great risk because they know that sneaky players can't be sure where the enemy is looking at.
Right now you know for sure that an enemy who turned his back to you has no idea where you are. That is a REALLY great thing in a 3rd person game! Please keep it that way.

**Louder crouching sound**
Yes, I know, a lot of you guys think that it is ""op"" that crouching is that quiet but honestly, if you tune up the crouch volume you take away the sneakier playstyle and reward camping even more!
In pubg the crouching is really really loud  and you basically can't sneak up on somebody, unless there is a plane, gunfight, car or airstrikes covering up your sounds. That rewards campers and discourages players who want to try to push/sneak up to a house/base or whatever somebody uses to hide/camp/defend.
I know reallife arguments in games are pretty stupid but I will make one just for this case: Imagine you sneaking up on your boy- or girlfriend to scare them. You don't even crouch and you are barely hearable if you are careful. 
But ok, reallife argument, I know but speaking game balance: It's just not right to give campers even more advantages. Let them be in fear at least.

Come on... that's a bit extreme. It's already not super hard to aim the shotgun, and then for it to basically do 100+ damage is a bit too much.

I had a legendary sniper rifle, full health kit, etc... and a green shotgun. Guy comes in the door I'm in a corner, I fire first, he hits me and I'm instantly dead. Just not fair. Would I have even lived had I used the med kit? Was nearly 130 hp going to let me survive? With what? 2 hp left?

It's just a bit too overpowered. Considering just how much of this game is close quarters at times... (and how easy it can be to gap close on people using walls) shotguns really shouldn't be doing one hit kills from full health.",FortNiteBR

EDIT: I just got paired with one other person, saved him from another player, and then he killed me. I even threw my guns on the ground so he could take them. I damn near threw my controller across the livingroom.

EDIT 2: I saved the clips of both games and both players so far have been reported, and I will likely keep saving clips and reporting players. It saddens me that Epic will not disclose whether any action will be taken due to my reports. They state ""Keep in mind that you will likely receive no response from this report. We place a high priority on player privacy, so we cannot share the details of any action we may take as a result of your report with anyone but the party or parties directly affected.""

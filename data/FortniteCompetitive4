Having placed 87th on 1wall6targetsTE, I naturally know what it takes to succeed against the best of the best in FN. While most know about the importance of a good ergonomic gaming chair, many often overlook what is under it.  Part 1 will cover the importance of a good *gaming carpet*.

#There Are 4 Different Types of Carpet Fiber:

*Nylon* - The most durable and stain resistant carpet fiber available. Meant for **aggressive w key** playstyles.

*Polyester* - Known for its luxurious look, feel and wonderful selection of colors and styles, this carpet is a **great pubstomping** option.

*Olefin* - Olefin offers good stain and moisture resistance, but scores below nylon and polyester for wearability. Recomended for **casual use** or **budget gaming.**

*Wool* - Favored for its natural beauty. Wool carpet has natural soil resistance qualities, but is not inherently stain resistant. Wool looks good for a long time and is well constructed. A favored choice amongst **passive scrim play**. Helps with **end game** and and noted for its **exceptional vod review**.

But you cant just stop at material selection. The *carpet texture* is equally as important.

Generally in this area, you have two options: 

#Cut Pile and Loop.

*Cut Pile* - Consists of yarns that are cut at the ends. The soft feel of cut pile carpet makes it a perfect choice for the most comfortable areas of your home. Shag is a type of cut pile (though not recommended for anything except trickshotting). Cut pile is generally exceptional at **edit plays** (forget your scroll wheel with this).

*Loop* - Has yarns that are looped and uncut on the carpet surface. Strength and soil hiding capabilities. This style is ideal for heavy traffic areas. Berber being the most common. Low pile berber is recomended for **playground warrioring**. High pile for **combination play at a high level**.(1 hour kovaaks session into 1 hour editing course/free building into 1 hour turtle wars warmup into 6 hour scrim/solo grind) Great for **long streams!**

#Gaming Carpet Accessories

*Pad* - Generally made of plastic, the pad sits under the gaming chair and allows for easier rolling. **Not recomended.**

*Scotch Guard* - Recomended for **mid to long range AR** control, this liquid spray will help **reduce bloom and increase FSA** (Comparable to kontrol freeks). Downsides include having to re apply gaurd every few years.

\- add heavy shotgun

\- add suppressed back

\- a little heavy sniper dmg nerf

\- old bullet drop to every sniper

\- 100% spawn rate of quad and hover board

\- dynamite stack to 2 (6)

\- add every splode to radius damage (it's 2019 ffs)

\- prevent only ammo on floor

\- increase chest spawn rates

\- how bad tilted and mega mall is, the slipstreams and the skybases (drones).

&amp;#x200B;

**Results (for a better understanding of these charts, read further)**

[This is the distribution \(sorted\) of the skill value \(1-100\) of the winners of each match. It's pretty clear that the lower the combat spawn rate is, the lower the average winner skill value is. Combat shotguns spawning at the same rate as pumps \(20&amp;#37;\) is actually pretty close to just rng and skill.](https://i.redd.it/gbkyw8emgl231.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[For a mathematical confirmation: a 99&amp;#37; confidence interval. As you can see, since the intervals don't overlap, they are statistically significant, and these values likely aren't random. Note: This doesn't include pure rng.](https://i.redd.it/r1m2o6gpgl231.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Model**

Each Match is made up of the following:

100 players are ""spawned"", each with a random, normally distributed (gaussian dist) skill value from 1 - 100. Each player is assigned an 'rng' value between 0.0 and 2.0. the ""value"" of the player is given by multiplying the 'rng' value with their skill value. This means that each player's value is at most 200, and accounts for both inherent skill and rng (if a player isn't as skilled, a high rng wont help them, but if a player is skilled, a low rng value will hurt them more).

However, since the combat shotgun gives players an inherent advantage (assumed 25% increase in ""value""), if they get a combat shotgun (spawn rate probability), they are automatically given a 2.0 rng value, effectively doubling their relative value.

A ""circle"" is computed where each player randomly fights another player. The higher ""value"" of each player determines who wins, and the winner moves on to the next 'circle'. This process is repeated until only 1 player is left. If the players have the same value, it's a fifty fifty toss up. If a player with a combat shotgun dies, their shotgun is given to the winner of the fight (doubling the winner's value).

Each match was repeated 1000 times at different values of the combat shotgun spawn rate. This simulation was written in python so rip aesthetics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions**

THIS IS NOT A RIGOROUS PROOF. There are a lot of inaccuracies with the model (doesn't account for players actively looking for kills, assumes 50% of the server dies each circle, doesn't account for afk players, fails to reflect health (i.e if a fight was close the winner is weaker thereby reducing their ""value""), third parties, and time of day.

I would still argue this provides a clear trend for the following reasons:

It simulates a much more stringent situation: since 50% of players are getting killed each circle, the parameters of survival become far more value based, which is (obviously) more correlated to skill. Thus, if anything, these numbers are artificially inflated. Also most of the intricacies I described would be statistical anomalies (save the health), and as such may be ignored. What cannot be ignored are things like POI clustering and culture (Salty is for sweats so higher skill players will be playing each other more). This will skew the values in an unpredictable direction.

The winning skill values may seem high, but if you consider the amount of players that are on their phones, play less than a few hours a month, and rarely play, a skill value of 70 isn't really that high. Since the skill values are normally distributed, there is less chance that players of a high (or low) skill level will go head to head, so higher skilled players will come out ahead more than average players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

This is simulated data that shows the impact of reduced spawn rates for an essential weapon within the game. It isn't meant to be conclusive proof, but it does provide some potential logos (the greek term) to the argument regarding the impact of reduced spawn rates.",FortniteCompetitive

If there are other lawyers here who practice crim law/white collar and think I’m wrong, please feel free to tell me I’m a dumbass and I’ll go back to my lane of securities transactions.

Let’s get into it. The applicable statute(s) are 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341-43 (Mail/Wire Fraud). To be found guilty, you would have to prove that (1) H1ghsky1 &amp; Faze devised or participated in scheme or artifice to defraud; and (2) advancing or carrying out scheme, or attempting to do so, they used or caused use of mails or an interstate wire transmission. **Being found guilty carries 20-year maximum sentence.**

The second element is clearly satisfied and not arguable (internet transmissions are included and they don’t even need to cross state lines). So the only issue is the first element.

“A scheme or artifice to defraud” is not defined in the statute. But it is generally understood as a plan or strategy to obtain something of value from another through use of deceit, trickery, or other dishonest methods. In this case, something of value would be: (1) all forms of twitch revenue; (2) money from Epic tournaments. Assuming Faze/family lied about his age, that would be deceit (there are some arguable points on intent/materiality. But to brief, I don’t think H1ghsky1 and Faze have great arguments on those fronts).

So, it appears that prosecutors do have a case under this theory. The question is, will they pursue it? I have to plead ignorance here and cannot speculate--we would need a prosecutor to chime in on prosecutorial discretion which I don't think they'd do on an internet forum for a video game. That said, this is not a trivial case: (1) Faze and H1ghsky1’s parents used a child to gain substantial profit; and (2) lied/were completely reckless about the negative consequences that could come with their lies being made public (child’s reputation ruined/potential career destroyed/emotional impact on a child losing something he has worked for/enjoyed). No kid should have to go through what h1ghsky1 is experiencing, and I think making his parents/Faze an example of what not to do is something to look at. I also think that we as a society have to be extremely cautious about kids in the streaming industry. There are so many avenues for exploitation. And as we see in H1ghsky1's case, sometimes their parents do not have their best interest in mind.",FortniteCompetitive

There have been enough times where I’m fed up with solo’s and there was no one on my friendslist to play with. Especially with trios/squads coming up, this could happen more often. Of course there is the possibility of your teammate not having a mic or skills, but with divisional queuing, I think that that won’t be a severe problem, since your champions league duo hopefully has a similar mindset. This concept is very common in other games (like Rocket League, Epic ;)) and has worked well. 

For champions league, it think it would add to learning new strats from random duos, less long queue times because there are more people queued up. Under 300 points it is a good concept for casuals, because it triggers them more to play Arena, rank up and get more into the competitive side of FN, which the comp scene will eventually benefit from. 

Lastly, I think a don’t fill option would not be good, because that leads to less packed lobbys.",FortniteCompetitive

Most items being completely useless and the rest being impossible to find. So, here is my opinion for solutions.*

**Vault:**
- Heavy Assault Rifle (Ever since it’s nerf it hasn’t been anywhere near as powerful as an Assault Rifle)
- Tactical Shotguns (Either vault or extremely buff. From any distance longer than a tile away, the gun becomes useless, doing low amounts of damage)
-Pistols &amp; Suppressed Pistols (Waste of  “filler” items you never see being utilized simply due to how poor it is)
- Minigun (No longer fits in with the meta and can be detrimental to an opponents game without doing damage; loss of materials)
- Hand Cannon (The Hand Cannon also lost its purpose with the evolution of the meta. There isn’t much explaining required)
- Grenade Launcher (Isn’t what it used to be. Has become a stale weapon. We have grenades now which can be more versatile than a grenade launcher)
- Heavy Sniper Rifle (Extremely overpowered. Deals insane amounts of damage and easily breaks through builds)
- Boom Bow (Rewards Inaccuracy, does significant damage for how little skill is required)
- Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle (Didn’t need to be unvaulted. Disliked item by community. Vaulting helps removed the current 5:2 Sniper:Shotgun Ratio)
- Dynamite (Dynamite either needs to be lowered to a max stack of 6 and drop 2 at a time or be vaulted. It has become overpowered when spammed)
- Stink Grenades (With the upcoming addition of the Storm Flip, Stink Grenades seem to be to similar to the new item. Vaulting Stink Grenades will give Storm Flip the ability to be refreshing)
- Turrets (No brainer. Useless item that gets dropped and ran by just as much as it gets picked up)
- Ballers (No matter how much you need the vehicle, it will always be overpowered one way or another. Easily can sneak it’s way into end game and get placement points. Takes away from competitiveness of having to fight to stay alive and also ruins the entertainment side of the competitive scene)

**Unvault:**
- Pump/Heavy Shotgun (Increasing the amount of shotguns in the game helps increase versatility in play styles. Helps reduce RNG)
- Suppressed Assault Rifle (Was a great weapon, not overpowered, not weak. Always fits in with almost any META)
- SMG/Suppressed SMG (Having to choose between a Drum Gun and a Burst SMG for a SMG spot is imbalanced. Unvaulting one of these weapons helps find middle ground)

**Spawn Changes:**
- Increase Combat Shotgun (For being the most powerful shotgun in the game and arguably the most essential weapon in the game. It should be available to nearly everyone. The lack of Combat Shotguns makes the gun more overpowered because the few players with the weapon have an advantage against others who might have a Tactical Shotgun which stands no chance)
- Decrease Burst SMG (The gun has now been in long enough that enough people should have been able to get their hands on it. Reducing the spawn rate to a near normal spawn rate helps settle the weapon into the rest of the Loot Pool)
- 100% QuadCrasher and Driftboard (Hoverboard) Spawns. (With the vaulting of ballers. These vehicles need to become available very easily providing sufficient mobility. Both vehicles are high risk high reward unlike the baller which is low risk high reward)
- Increase Shield Spawns ( Although there are plenty of ways to get shield, it still seems to be a struggle to head into an endgame without a max stack of whatever shields I may be carrying and be able to play comfortably)
**Possible Solution:** After having 100 shield, you can carry mushrooms as an item in your inventory. Having a max stack of 15.

If any of you have any other ideas on how to help balance the current Loot Pool, please start a discussion about it. If you disagree with any parts feel free to also comment.

**TLDR:**
Vault: Heavy Assault Rifle, Tactical Shotgun, Both Pistols, Minigun, Hand Cannon, Grenade Launcher, Heavy Sniper, Boom Bow, Semi-Auto Sniper, Dynamite, Stink Grenades, Turret, and Ballers.
Unvault: Pump/Heavy Shotgun, Suppressed Assault Rifle, and SMG/Suppressed SMG.
Spawn Changes: Increase Combat Shotgun, Decrease Burst SMG, 100% Quadcrasher and Hoverboard Spawns, and Increase Shield Spawns.
Extra Idea: After having max shield you can carry Mushrooms to a max stack of 15.",FortniteCompetitive

Meanwhile you can get a semiauto snipe which are rarely used. 

Pump was the first gun players looked for when landing because thats how this game is designed to be played. Even today players still look for tac or smg to land on to make sure the 50-50 fight is in their favor. 

Now why I think combat was a mistake is because  after we learned how to use the gun it was way faster than double could ever be. It literally turned into a spray meta rather than shoot and build meta. Epic then understood that little Timmy found it hard to use the gun and competitive players adopted quickly and loved the gun. Combat cannot one shot players with 200hp but the pump did could do that, however, it wasn't as easy as shooting twice. Once you miss a shot you were vulnerable well combat has already fixed that. 

Assuming after looking at new kill stats about the shotgun kill percentage they probably found that it increase or was probably close to 26%. Epic needs to understand that this game is about close range and building. In any other game you prefer to fight from far and take cover rather than push your enemy. It makes fortnite completely different and fun to play. 

Epic needs to fix the numbers for the loot and fix their weapon selection. I stopped playing about 2 weeks ago because I felt like I was spending way to much time in the game without actually enjoying and honestly I feel like I made the right decision. Don't get me wrong this game has been one of the best games I have ever played. 

I have no idea how else to voice my opinion and frustrations. We all can agree the tac is not a shotgun any good player wants to use. I can adapt but it isn't fun to play this game then.",FortniteCompetitive

Does it not speak to anyone when an entire subreddit for weeks/months on end is just complaining and moaning about the state of the game? Here's some advice that I did months ago.

Quit the game.

There's a reason that many players have quit and are going to quit after the WC, unless you're a streamer or a content creator with a code, there's very little reason to play a game you don't enjoy, and it's blatantly obvious from this subreddit that many don't like the current state of the game and haven't for sometime.

Am I a bot? No, I played in Season 1, worked my way up to 1600 wins and decided the game was going in a direction I personally didn't enjoy and finally quit in Season 6. When it was obviously moving towards turtle wars I said enough is enough, that isn't the reason I enjoyed competitive, it's not the reason I played Fortnite for so long, I'm out.

I remember when planes where an issue and look at the game now, it's even worse than before, ninja grenades, ballers, combat shotgun issues, need I go on. Secondly they're milking the community with new skins nearly everyday (it's so obvious what the game has become),, it's become disposable, simply a way to make money, they're not taking any of this seriously, and they couldn't care less about the state of competitive.

Fortnite now reminds me of the mobile game market, crap intended to get people addicted in order for them to make as much money as possible, that's the truth, the soul, the substance, it's all gone.

I loved Fortnite, I loved competitive, I still follow the community every single day as it was such a big part of my life, but for those who aren't happy, play Apex or something, no ones forcing you to continue, yes you might be emotionally invested in the game, but trust me once you step away for a few weeks, you'll see you aren't as invested as you thought you were.

 I've already uninstalled, I just can't play this game and continue being a sane individual, I play one match and problems have already started presenting themselves. And not now even talking about the Loot Pool, bloom, RNG, none of that, that I can deal with. I'm just talking about servers, ping, and the sound in this game. They are just soooo bad, I play every other game and it's not **THIS** bad.

I honestly thought taking a 2 week long brake from this game would be beneficial, but after coming back and seeing that the game has actually gotten worse is just VERY VERY discouraging.

I've tried to qualify for Sundays, but it's almost impossible for me and my internet really. 

And for anyone who's wondering I get 50 ping on the daily, and packet losses like every 2 minutes, the worse ones I've gotten today, which really pushed me over the edge. In one match I engaged a fight and ended up being frozen for 6 seconds. And because of that I'm just done with playing competitively and this game all together.

make headshot multiplier to 2.4-2.5 so they all do over 200 on perfect headshots. Keep fire rate at 0.7 in this case.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic has been pretty adamant that they want the game to be playable in a variety of styles. Close range, far range, high ground, low ground, run and gun, stationary, etc. What better way to do this than to let players carry an unlimited amount of guns or items. Why should I be limited to the deagles or a sub or a drum gun or a tactical sub, when I can carry everything because every situation in this game call for a different items. I don't think it would be that hard to implement a system where you can hold everything (or at least 10 varied items). You would still be limited to 5 slots of items...but you'd  be allowed to carry essentially whatever you pick up.  


Couple of things I considered:  
Health/Shield - Obviously this would require a change. I'm thinking every player would only be able to carry a certain amount of additional shield and health, yet the current caps would still be in place. I.E A player can only carry 15 bandages or one medkit etc.

Items littering everywhere - let items dissapear after a while

Chests - 100% chest spawn rate.

  
Obviously it would be up to Epic to decide combinations of what can and cant be held. For instance I don't think it'd be  fair to be able to hold two drum guns or a heavy sniper and a boombow.

Fortnite has without a doubt been the best videogame I've ever played.  It came out my first year of college and it has helped me make so many friends.  I've grinded hours and hours of playground, creative, pop up cups, arena, and even Kovaak's to try and get better.  However, if you're not enjoying the game you should never feel that you've put too much time and effort in the game to quit.  I've played probably 5-10 hours of Season 9 and I haven't looked back since.  However I still see posts from this subreddit of people complaining that they're not enjoying the game because of the loot pool, lack of shotguns, and even lack of care from Epic.  

Epic isn't going to magically make this game competitively viable in some future update.  They want this game to be as casual as possible to retain as many people as they can.  If you're like me and don't enjoy the direction this game is going in then don't play.  Try a weekend without Fortnite and you'll see how much happier you'll be.",FortniteCompetitive

I am formally asking Epic Games for an investigation to look into this. There are, by slugs admission, others as well though and until Epic looks into VoDs, its impossible to determine who these may be so I will stick to these two and Wuji, who has already been proven to feed back in week 3.

Now for the proof that has been gathered:

[Slugs admission of guilt](https://imgur.com/a/ywIqaZJ)

[Proof of this being the twitter of Slugs - same name, same city, same college, SSBM player. Youll also notice he has liked xxifs tweet qualifying](https://imgur.com/a/YrzaLY0)

[Proof BHEGS is the brother of Slug - both from PA as well](https://imgur.com/a/BVtK0JM)

[Additional proof of a link between Slug, who has admitted multiple duos are feeding, and Wuji](https://imgur.com/a/RZ3F6fX)

[Proof of slugs Epic account](https://imgur.com/a/RnTpggB)

Slug has admitted to feeding kills since week 2. He admits there are multiple teams doing this. He makes a tweet indicating BHEGS is his brother. BHEGS duo is Wuji, who was proven to be feeding kills to xxif. Now who is slugs feeding if not his own brother? That is the motivation to cheat - to help family. His own brother who is duoing with Wuji, a proven feeder already.

Now once again, these are all allegations. **But the coincidences are too strong to not warrant looking into**.

I had replaced all the walls on the second story, working on the floors and roof when a pro player ramped on the roof of the house and claimed my roof. I was discussing with people in a discord if I was allowed to fight him or not. They said that a rule started that you are not allowed to destroy someone’s builds or build directly on top of or next to them. So we agreed that I would be allowed to fight them. 7 seconds before zone closed I shot his wall down to signal to him to move but he didn’t. As soon as second zone fully closed I stole his wall and killed him. LESS THAN ONE MINUTE LATER I WAS BANNED FOR THREE DAYS. It takes less than one minute for a pro to ban someone when it was a pro who broke the rules with no physical proof. When I report someone they usually do not get banned at all. I don’t know if signed pros get special permissions or what. I think this is really unjust. I so far have dmed some of the management on twitter and discord and have yet to receive a reply so far, I have even went to asking in zayt’s stream twice only for him to read the comments above and below mine but ignore me.

249,hole-up,1559589100,bwembv,14,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bwembv/fov_compromise_proposal_for_epic/,0,FOV Compromise Proposal for Epic,"Hi all,

With the AMA ending our hopes of an all around FOV slider (I’m actually probably one of the few with Epic on this one—I like the idea of a standard FOV for combat), I was thinking we could propose a compromise. Perhaps we could ask for a building FOV, similar to how controller players have a building sensitivity.

Hear me out—players want the increased FOV mostly for greater awareness in build battles/late game. This comes into play mostly when players have their builds out. Usually when a player is shooting at another player, the FOV is of less importance. Thus, having greater FOV while building may be a reasonable request.

From Epic’s perspective, this may even be beneficial to them. Sometimes when I watch streamers who have 100+ frames on their 60fps Twitch streams, it can be hard to tell what they are doing with all of their builds. In scenarios like those, greater FOV would ~help~ the viewer.

Finally, my last thought. When switching from builds to weapons, there is a delay before you can shoot (ie: if you edit on someone who is looking at you, it’s hard to get the first shot). The time of this delay could be the time used to switch back to the combat FOV. In the other direction, building is less precise than combat aiming, so it is unlikely that a player would get thrown off by the change in FOV, and by the time that they are turning (for 90’s or whatnot) the building FOV will have taken effect.",FortniteCompetitive

I disagree. It definitely is playing to the best of one's abilities when there's no way out.

1. You deny your opponent a point. An opponent that could be blocking you from a qualification or standing with that very point.

2. You get to a game quicker.

There are examples in CSGO and even Fortnite where pros use this.

In CSGO pros will throw their AWP or other weapon out of reach from their opponents to deny them the weapon after being killed, even though you could try an fight. They know that in some spots there just isn't a reasonable chance of winning a fight and decide to do the right play and deny the weapon.

In FN, no one bats an eye when players suicide in games to get to the last que of the tournament. How is that playing to the best of their abilities in that specific match? It's not, but it IS the right play and it IS playing to the best of your ability in terms of the whole tournament, just like killing yourself when you know you can deny a point and get to the lobby faster.",FortniteCompetitive

However, running a tac in this season against a combat is just not possible, the combat is superior in every aspect and it's consistent and had the range, that's why literally every time you fight someone who has a combat with a tac you dont have a chance even if you only hit headshots 

i feel like a meta with combats and pumps would be the way to go since the combat now just feel like a legendary and epic variant of the tac

It seems the current format favors rewarding players for having a spike rather than demonstrating consistency. One pop-off week is all it takes to qualify which is highly unfair to skilled players given how RNG the game is. 

I am just saying, I would rather see a player who placed 9th, 24th, 20th, 26th, 18th compete rather than a player who placed 4th (qualified), 56th, 150th, 12th, 76th.

I say a better format is to keep the Weekly Qualifier Events and point scoring system. However, instead of deciding qualified players each week, players should be selected at the end of the 10 week period based on their average placement. 

For Europe, it is those who average amongst the Top 40, in NA East Top 30, NA West Top 10, Asia Top 7, Brazil Top 7, and Oceana Top 5.

Tie breakers are decided based on Total Victory Royales, followed by Total Survival Time, and lastly Total Eliminations.

This format makes much more sense to me. Thoughts?",FortniteCompetitive

Previously, before patch 8.30 (I believe, let me know if I'm wrong) Stretched resolution would force a higher vertical FOV to compensate for what would be a loss of horizontal FOV. Essentially, by zooming out from your character's default FOV (80) you would NOT lose horizontal FOV, (whereas in other titles, H1Z1, CSGO as two prime examples, you lose horizontal FOV due to vertical not being increased. However after patch 8.30, verical FOV was significantly limited while playing on a stretched resolution and locked at the same as native resolution. This forced an immediate migration towards Native Resolution because there was no reason to play on it anymore, you'd purposely be limiting your effectiveness at long range, and as I mentioned before, you'd be experiencing a cutoff of FOV horizontally. Recently, this got me thinking, ""If in H1Z1, and CSGO there's no FOV gain with stretching your resolution, why do pro players and competitive often use 4:3?"" After doing some research, I found that it does NOT increase the size of hitboxes, (which is a common misconception) but rather makes targets *feel* (I can't stress this enough) *FEEL* easier to hit. Another reason I can see why players play stretched is because while lowering your horizontal FOV, I makes it easier to focus on what's in front of you. (even without blackbars.) This is because there's less on your screen at once to distract you. Lastly, of course you have the fact that you can gain a sizeable amount of frames to overall, make your experience smoother. Something that is often talked about with switching to stretched is sensitivity. ""It feels different!"" Recently a buddy of mine did some math and calculated how to find your sensitivity on 4:3 (1440x1080) or 1444x1080 (better crosshair) All you have to do is multiply  your horizontal sensitivity by *0.7520625* or *0.75* (to simplify things) for a resolution of 1444x1080 or multiply for horizontal sense by 0.750469 if you want to play 1440x1080. I've tried this and my aim was literally like 5x better. (It COULD have been placebo but I really did have an easier time focusing and hitting shots.) ""Surely there aren't only positives for this, what are the negatives?"" - Well as I mentioned before, the way Fortnite treats stretched resolutions now, you'll lose horizontal FOV which is not really a WHOLE lot but it is something that could be crucial in *some* situations. But as mentioned before, the same thing happens in other games and that has really not stopped anybody. I've only seen about one clip from CS:GO where a player missed an enemy because he was playing on a 4:3 resolution. So do this but at your own risk.

The reason people w key in arena is because there’s nothing to play for. Epic can fix this by adding even more ranks or just add more prizes for normal arena, like a 25 or 50 vbucks prize if you win a game in champions league. This would 100% make end games very stacked, just like in finals.

-started s6
-first game I’ve ever played 
-20 y/o 

I’m not in college after dropping out my freshman year for entrepreneurial reasons. I moved away from home to nyc after dropping out and did well and made a lot of money but honestly got tired of it all and found that money didn’t buy happiness even though I made A LOT more than a 19 year old should have and now I’m back home with my parents doing nothing . I started s6 and ended up being really good relative to my friends and they encouraged me to try out competitive. Im well into champs league and play customs and am top 15 in many kovaaks scenarios and practice edit courses and 1v1 mechanics a lot. But, my game sense kinda sucks since I’ve started so late with no prior gaming experience. I’ve decided to use moving home with nothing really planned for myself to just give it a shot since I do enjoy the game (currently). I’ve made finals once but didn’t place well at all. I really just don’t have the game sense in me even though my mechanical skills and aim are definitely there. Since I’m 20 I feel like I shouldn’t be chasing this dream at all but I feel so invested at this point and still motivated. Is it worth trying after the WC quals? I know I won’t make it at this point but I feel like if you’re not top 100 consistently then it’s not even worth pursuing at my age lol. Late night 1am thoughts amirite",FortniteCompetitive

it makes absolutely no sense. 

it makes me feel like epic has never even see a storm surge arena / world cup qualifier match on a console

why epic? why are you making so many terrible choices to cater to people who aren’t even able to actually play? 

i wish i had a clip of the first endgame i made it to today with storm surge
it was awful. got top 15 in that specific game if it matters. so that was nice to get 3 placement points for top 15 but i played at 10-35 frames the whole endgame

please epic let people who can actually compete, truly compete (by not including ballers, separate loot pools, no boom bow, fov slider, ect) 

this game is such a joke when it could be so amazing. i love this game in concept but the way epic continues to execute competitive is terrible

I get that, just look what happened to all the COD Black Ops games. The only thing they did was add a Jetpack and remove knife instant-killing. But besides that, it remains the same old shitty Black Ops.

But when Epic Games vaults something and replaces that very same vaulted weapon with a weapon who’s fire type has failed in the past, and vaults a weapon that was loved by the community and NO ONE complained about, that’s a low blow, especially to the competitive scene. 

Let me get to the point: the new burst SMG SUCKS. The recoil on the damn thing is crazy high and it’s a burst fire weapon.

The main point: BURST FIRE WEAPONS HAVE NOT AND DO NOT BELONG IN FORTNITE BATTLE ROYALE. They suck. Automatic and semi automatic (except you, semi auto sniper, burn in a fire) weapons have proven to be far more superior than burst weapons. And yet, the best SMG known to Fortnite gets vaulted and gets replaced with a gun as effective as a pool noodle.",FortniteCompetitive

My question is why the default is 80, it’s a low default relative to other competitive games. I ofc love games that let me go to 110 or even 120 FoV because that’s what I’m used to because of games like Rocket League capping me at 110 and playing Kovaaks at 120. Other games cap me at ~100, which is still fine with me, and most games use a DEFAULT (what a lot of casuals still with) of 90 or 100.

80 is below the default of most games, and most players are not used to it. Casual console players are used to above 80 because of other games they play casually as much as competitive Fortnite players who often come from games like CSGO.",FortniteCompetitive

The problem however, is that a lot of them require multiple players. If I want to play zone wars now, I have to find a bunch of other people, add them, and invite them to my game. I can also join a creative server, but these are generally pretty inactive, it's very hard to find a server hosting the mode you want to play.

If the game had a server browser, anytime I wanted to play zone wars, or buildfight, I could simply search for it and find servers playing this mode, see their playcounts, and click to join. It would allow players to actually play the multitude of creative modes easily and conveniently, something that will increase the longetivity of the game for players who are getting bored of the BR mode.

I’m a bit frustrated right now, because me and my duo teammate have been practicing for this weeks qualifiers in closed it customs, we received a message from the Dyno bot on discord today to say that we have been banned from the server for ‘W keying’.

 The rules of the game clearly state that you can fight after 2nd zone, and not to W key stupidly. Here’s where we got banned: Me and my teammate are rotating into 3rd zone (while it’s closing) when we see an easy target : a solo sat in a 1x1. (keep in mind we NEED this kill because it’s a solo so it’s an opportunity to get loot because we both have very bad grey load outs and low ammo.) 

We begin pressuring both sides of the box and eventually kill him. Like I said we needed this kill because we had very bad loot and Ammo and it was a solo, that’s just part of the game (don’t loose your teammate? Lol /s. 

Anyway, the video that was sent back to us that the reporter (player we killed) had submit, doesn’t show zone or anything at all, it just shows us pushing him (the solo in a 1x1) in replay mode. I’m very dissapointed that a player has reported us simply for killing him, and I’m even more frustrated that it actually led to a ban, so far this was the best practice we were getting, and to have it taken away from us because a player made the decision to go out of his way to report us because he’s sad that he died, is very annoying.

I can’t find anyone to contact, I’d really like to get back into these customs, if there’s anyone that could help that would be really great, I hope this can be solved, thanks. 🙏",FortniteCompetitive

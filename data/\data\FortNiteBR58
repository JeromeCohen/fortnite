The main complaint since the recent patch has been concerning the Health/Shield for kills. Even Epic admitted that this and other changes led to incredibly aggressive players.  But for those that enjoyed this kind of gameplay, there is **Arena Mode, a mode players can play with these settings enabled.** Many professional players, for example Ninja, have been boycotting Fortnite due to these changes.

With everyone being high skilled it’s almost impossible to survive after landing when your house is pretty much empty except for a grey pistol while everyone else seems to have pumps and shield. Honestly the loot pool is way to large. In an ideal competitive scene, I think the only weapons to exist should be blue variants of pump, smg, AR, and a bolt sniper. A tighter loot pool would mean the game is based more on skill than this bs RNG. Also, these boogie bombs are way too OP to the point where you can just walk up to someone and one pump them. They seriously need to be removed. Building has to be fixed too. Clingers need to be removed I can’t stand them. Dynamite stacks should be reduced. Merging through walls is a serious problem and should be fixed by forcing a player to one side of the wall instead of having them be able to stand in it. ( + it might not be a bad idea to have a testing ltm where turbo build is disable) . Bloom is also ridiculous.  Heavy sniper is pretty much the only weapon where it requires skill to hit a target at range.

I primarily play Team Rumble and I have a few suggestions I would love to talk about. Feel free to add your own.
    
  &amp;nbsp;
  
- Make glider re-deploy a naturally occurring action (does not take an item slot)
    
  &amp;nbsp;
  
- Make it so when you open up a chest and collect a glider re-deploy (10-count), that it doesn't automatically remove your glider re-deply (50-count).
    
  &amp;nbsp;
  
- When there are challenges such as ""Kill opponents at a certain location"", make these locations more commonly the final circle in Team Rumble. I suck and I need the help.

Because casual players grew tired of getting rolled by soccer sweats all the time.  If casual players stop having fun, Fortnite dies.

Epics solution?

Add a ranked mode called Arena where good players (not great players) climb to the mid ranks, get frustrated playing against equal competition, and can cheese their way back to lower levels by committing suicide a few times so they can roll bots at lower levels.

Or, players can play in standard modes where semi pro players can go for 20 bombs against bots.

Epic, you have to implement a mode that takes into account two statistics and two statistics alone.  KD ratio and win rate.

Fortnite is going to keep losing players until no life sweats and bots are separated effectively.  The current system to do so is a complete joke.  I've seen players with 15+ kills in both modes today.",FortNiteBR

Epic has essentially outplayed everyone including me. 

I’ve been playing and watching all of the streamers complain and be all upset because they can’t be bothered dealing with a ranked playlist is hilarious. Honestly hilarious.

The circle spawns around named places and other POIs (and surrounding area if it is small). The prop teams start on the main island and has 60 seconds to change between 1 of 3 props (optional) and then hide. The storm forms immediately and does 10 damage per tick to counter people leaving the search area. After the 60 second hiding period is up, the hunters drop directly above the zone and begin their search for the enemies (props). 

The prop team has increased movement speed and are equipped with 3 smoke grenades. Props have the same health that their prop does in game. Props can also emote (maybe). 

The hunter team is equipped with a pump, suppressed smg, scoped ar, and a spike trap. Ammo is limited to counter excessive spraying. When damage is dealt to an enemy disguised as a prop, a different sound is made to help differentiate between real and fake props.

When a noob skin gets wrecked by TFue, TFue gets his health back? Does that make any sense?

I think health-on-kill encourages players to be lazy and not be tactical or stealthy at all. After killing a player, I loot as fast as possible, then GTFO and heal. If we get health from kills, we can just go beast mode and not care about healing or being stealthy which is not encouraging for newer players, or controller/mobile players.

However, it would be good to have health-on-kill in Large Team Modes, I think, since there are usually so many players in a small spot when the circle gets smaller, and also because it's a waste of inventory space to pick up heals in a large team mode because you're going to end up dying a bunch anyway.

Just my opinion, probably will get buried anyway.",FortNiteBR

It didn’t bother me that the 50 health/shield was gone besides in the ranked mode and the reason why it makes sense atleast to me. Is because casual players of fortnite don’t get 10 kills a game. So now you have pros running around getting 20 kills a game. Sometimes even 30. Something they hardly did before they added that change because they don’t have to worry about being aggressive. They don’t need to worry about carrying any health item because they’re load out could be all guns. People are all pissed about an update. Here’s the thing. Are you actually upset or affected by it or are you just mad because all the streamers are mad? Because honestly I’ve asked a lot of friends and people in random duos who aren’t super competitive and a lot say they couldn’t care less ,FortNiteBR

3. You are only permitted a free elimination the final player. If you go over then you are disqualified. 
4. You can build to get away if your vehicle is destroyed but bring a glider if your going to make a risky jump.
5. You can scavenge weapons off dead players but cannot damage them.

You don't have to do this if you don't want I just threw this out there since I have been doing it. And I got to say it can be very exhilarating. The only tips I can offer is to just be faster than your opponent and disappear if needed.

Console, Switch, and mobile are all horrible at the moment. Textures not loading, lobbies full of  default Ramirez. Sound on the switch during emotes don’t even play half the time, or stop in the middle. 

I can see why epic removed the siphon, but it’s not necessary. It would be best to just meet in the middle and change the siphon down to 25 hp/shield. And the change with the mats were so great, I couldn’t find a single person who wanted it removed. Console players can’t play Arena because they are paired with PC players, making it very unfair. 

I’m finding it harder to be able to hold more of the “fortnitey” fun items, because I now have to always carry heals again. It’s not a risk/reward scenario on every fight, it’s almost always risk.  You’re always coming out of fights with low health and shield, after fighting someone only to upgrade your pump from a green to a blue.

IMO, epic needs to take more time on their updates. Even if we have to wait 2 weeks for an update, it’s better than a glitchy, buggy mess every week that removes features nobody asked to be removed.

Weekly challenges aren’t fun, and feel more like a chore just to get the battle pass rewards. Daily challenges are boring as well, the same stuff every day.

The snow biome has been severely overlooked. It’s boring, it’s big, and nobody wants the land there except for polar. I bet most people haven’t been to Frosty ever since the start of season 8, except for challenges.

I love Fortnite, but it’s gotten repetitive, boring, and sometimes angering to play due to all the bugs. Epic, please fix your game.

You’re a new player to the game, and you decide to give it a chance. You go into a game and loot and hide throughout the game. You get to the final circle and see two people fighting. Assuming they’re weak, one guy kills the other, so you start shooting at the first guy. You hit him a bunch of times and it’s almost as if he isn’t tanking any damage. He climbs up and one-pumps you to the head effortlessly. You quit the game, confused and upset.

It made players who could easily pop 10+ kill games invulnerable. It ruined the game and the fairness. That’s why it needed to be reverted, and nothing will change my mind on this. So stop complaining, and play the game fairly instead of complaining about getting free wins. It’s not supposed to be easy. Play fair. The idea isn’t that much to comprehend. The reversion was needed.

I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game and I have not regretted it until now. I have 831 wins and a 4.2 kd. 

I have had some frustrations with other updates like tommy guns or air plains but I have always wanted to keep playing however now after update 8.2 (I think it is number 8.2) I don’t know if it is worth it anymore. 

I thought the beginning of the season was prime fortnite and it made me almost completely stop playing the other games in had been playing (nba 2k19, Apex, FIFA, and rocket League) but now fortnite feels empty. 

My experiences so far after the patch have been awful I have been forced to sit and mind numbingly farm materials and if I don’t do that I am punished. If I try to be aggressive early game I am able to get two or three people but than somebody who has good loot and sat mining materials and got shield will come and beat me every time because I am weak or low on mats. Late game I will get 3-4 people but than people over time will have tag little by little off my health and there is absolutely no way to go get the meds of my kills and I will have already used all of mine resulting in my almost guaranteed death. 

This is what my experience has been so tell me what yours has been in the comments and I will respond. I know a lot of people do not agree because they do not enjoy getting insta finished for health ( neither do I) however when the game is unplayable so that players don’t get finished it just isn’t worth it anymore

I NEVER use Raider's Revenge, because I don't like the sound, and kind of wish I got Ghoul Trooper.

* Shots are literally going through fully built walls and structures
https://streamable.com/sc96s

* Audio is super broken https://streamable.com/i63ry

* You can shoot through rifts now - or the player is somehow on the ground even though they rifted https://streamable.com/t3i3h

* Turbo build doesn't work at all - I can hold build with a floor, cone, wall, whatever, and other players will easily walk through them or wall replace me. I can do the same to other console players. I'm on a wired fiber optic connection so it's not my internet https://www.twitch.tv/videos/402555221

* My cone is destroyed on his screen but still looks like it's protecting me on mine https://www.twitch.tv/videos/402555222

* Replaced walls show that they're mine and can be edited. Except they're not mine and I can't edit them https://streamable.com/bbaj4

* The bush doesn't have aim assist. It's supposed to protect you from a shot but there's no aim assist with it on, so you're at a disadvantage for wearing it. PC players don't play with aim assist so it's not an issue.

* A HUGE advantage for PC players that controller players don't have - when you hold down Mouse 1 and you're firing a gun for example, you can continue holding M1 and click your wall, floor, ramp or cone to place them immediately. On controller, you can do the same with walls when you're holding down fire. If you tap build mode, it will place a wall immediately. However, you can't do this with ramps, floors, or cones, which is a HUGE disadvantage in competitive.

* Aim down sight is inconsistent - either you ADS too quickly after being in build mode and it won't aim, even after you hold down L2/left trigger, or if you're walking down elevation/fall a level while holding aim, you can't ADS until you release and press again

* Instant build does not place instantly all the time. Also an issue where if you place a trap and there's a delay when you try to instantly place a wall or other build.

* Last may be placebo, but aim assist feels weaker at short to mid-range, which I haven't experienced until recently. It feels like it has 1/4 of the assist as before and is less consistent. It was never strong at long range so that's not an issue.

**This is just on console, doesn't take these other issues into account**

* Microstutters feel more common than they did before

* Random jump fatigue is still just as common. Unsure if this is related to microstutters

* Hold to swap weapons is a great idea that doesn't work correctly. Will swap the gun in your inventory when tapping pick up instead of holding.

* Trees that you pickaxe make sound like they've just been hit a second after you stopped hitting them - makes it hard to tell if another player just hit a tree nearby

* Ghost shots

In a battle royale that's already so unforgiving for every mistake you make, it can be pretty frustrating that the game adds so many more mistakes you can't control.",FortNiteBR

I will add a video below because it's difficult to explain what the image looks like. Players, items have sort of a whitish glow to them, buildings in tilted seem to stutter while looking at them.

I'm playing the game on a laptop paired with a Dell monitor, 27inch 2k 144hz. I play the game on 1080p, 1444x1080, 1600x1080 and the problem is always there, thow most visible in 1080p.

It seems as though there’s a blatant ignorance on Epic Games behalf and while some people on here might argue - they’ve monumentally fucked up with this recent patch. Everyone from pros, to the most casual of casuals are upset. 

I personally enjoyed being forced to become better and forced to fight harder opponents who could actually build, shoot and read the game well (which the 7.40 update actually enabled). For me it kept the game fun, as it was somewhat of a challenge to work toward and honestly managed to become twice the player with relatively little time invested. 

I like the arena mode, I’ve been playing it since the patch and I’m at about 170 points after two nights. But I don’t like the fact that I can’t step aside from absolutely sweating my nuts off and have a rewarding pub sesh with my mates. As it stands, pubs is a monstrosity - as many have already said - I fight a sqaud and win, come out on 15hp and 100 mats and pretty much instantaneously get fucked on by the third party. That isn’t fun, that isn’t worth my time and it certainly isn’t representative of my or the other teams skill. 

The only real way we as a community can force a change is to boycott the purchasing of items. Don’t buy the new packs that come out, don’t buy the new skins, don’t buy tiers, don’t buy anything. Hit the COMPANY where it hurts by keeping your money in your pockets. The moment their revenue is threatened the majority will get what we are asking for, like you saw when APEX launched. We as a community need to realise the power we hold and take measure to insure we get what’s best for the majority. ",FortNiteBR

I will talk about **loadout variety** and **building aspect** and how it affected people who doesn't want to invest 10 hours a day in creative.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for my ENGLISH.

# LACK OF VARIETY

Since season 4 ended with the rise of the spray meta, we pretty much didn't saw any new valuable weapons you can add to your ultimate loadout.

Its pretty much PUMP, AR, SMG, EXPLOSIVE/SNIPER/Abusive utility or item, heals.

Back in the day,  we had an insane loadout variety which made the gameplay a lot more fun through the mechanics.

\&gt;&gt; **And before you exit because of** ""Another one who wants double-pump back"" - I'm **against double pump** until its balanced - (which will be fine with the range nerf BTW) please take your time and read,  **I guarantee most of you will be interested.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Back in season 3, Epic introduced patch 3.0 which includes double-pump nerf:

&amp;#x200B;

This patch is where we had the most variety loadouts and healthiest meta in the game.

AKA:

[https://i.imgur.com/717LYQ1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/717LYQ1.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Turbo build was a thing but not as broken as now, and SMGs weren't absolute dumb and spammy. they had few DMG less, and fun to use to vary your gameplay loadout.

I used to rock pump-tac and heavy-tac alot, because of the range and close range variations.

**3.0 Explaination:**

Basically, everytime you swapped a pump shotgun to another pump shotgun - you had to ""pump"" your shotgun before you shoot.

It looked just like that:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKRaH5Ro9mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKRaH5Ro9mo)

And you were able to swap between Pump to any other shotgun that wasn't a pump shotgun, just like that:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPwXePxABgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPwXePxABgw)

**Weapon pull-out time:**

Fortnite suffers from an awkward weapon pullout time for lots of weapons, the game used to feel so smooth and natural when you swap between weapons - just like that:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tGD0Vy5ZnA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tGD0Vy5ZnA)

IMO reverting the weapon swapping to how It were back then will make the game feel way better then now.

**People thoughts on the old weapon roaster and the overall game back in Season 3:**

When I was watching old gameplays, I found a short clip of TSM\_Myth's opinion back in the day about things he would add and remove from Fortnite back in season 3;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHSn-ZnCM5E&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHSn-ZnCM5E&amp;feature=youtu.be)

When thinking about it nowadays, if you ask people the same question they'll make a long Grocery list about anything that needs to be changed and removed from Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

**""ShOtGUn sWaPping was an exploit and never comeback"":**

Weapon and overall shotgun swapping is a well known meta for lots of games, such as GunZ, Microvolts - swapping is the thing made me play in the first place back in season 1, and same for lots of people.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Building aspect:

as of season 8, pretty much in a 100 players lobby you'll have 15 overbuilding players and camping players which plays like its a 1m dollar turney.

its irritating and hell not fun.

casual playlist needs to be a fun and chill place to play, especially noob friendly for newcomers and people who doesn't wanna play playground 10hrs a day to get any better.

And don't get me wrong, I used to play competitive and I'm a very good player myself overall - here are my pub stats aside my 1600+ wins

[https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Iraqian](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Iraqian)

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is - I really want skill gap to be a thing, but I want my friends who barely plays to have fun. I mostly carry them so they really have fun - but it became to a point they refuse to login until I login too because its just too hard for them.

And this made me realize the current state of Fortnite.

**MMR is NOT a solution.**

I played lots of games with MMR, in a PvP BR game this is definitely not the solution.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;&gt;But if MMR cant solve it, what else?

&amp;#x200B;

**Nerfing building HARDLY.**

I watched lots of youtubers who quit Fortnite and got the same answer why they quit - ""Early Fortnite,  was 10% building and mostly pure AIM fights. Simple weapon roaster and fun swap mechanics. And they are all gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized how Turbo building with the addition of the Pyramid strats just ruined the game, literally 99.9 of the builders will become just bad because they mostly have 0 gamesense and bad Aim.

&amp;#x200B;

My final suggestions for this topic are simple:

\- Test all above in an LTM.

\- If it found successful, Implement this to the regular gameplay after world-cup ends.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**To fix Fortnite we need loadout variety and remove turbo building or pyramids.",FortNiteBR

I play a lot of squads with my console friends who are not good, but even they appreciated the Shield and mats feature because it helped them survive.

Basically, I believe an improvement that both Epic and the community would love is that you only gain 25 health per kill, this would somewhat improve the situation of everyone being on 200 HP constantly AND also gives the community what they want with materials and some health per kill,

But you know what no one has actually addressed? Making thirsting a task in itself.

You're losing 2/hp a second and you're dead in 50 seconds. You're dead in 3 seconds if the enemy is thirsty.

What if you had a 90% damage reduction while knocked? This means AR does 3-4 dmg a shot. 6-7 dmg if headshots. SMG is 2-3 and 5-6. That's pretty reasonable, you can still thirst them but you're going to have to actually do more than a few shots to do it.

With an AR, you're using most of your clip just to kill them in seconds. This is also pretty good, because it means that if you thirst someone? You're going to be in a bad place for reloading if you're interrupted.

Sweats are happy, they still get their shield/health after finishing the enemies.

Casuals are happy, they no longer lose everything just because they got 1-pumped and the enemy has a second to spare.

I hate farming it’s the most boring part and shouldn’t be also made the most timely 

But I realized that I also don’t like this competitive mode. After getting a few kills and advancing I am now playing with people WAY BETTER THAN ME. I would prefer to just go back to everyone mixed and only sometimes come across people this good. But to do that I have to farm mats for the majority of the game.

(TL:DR at the bottom),"You can take the 50 health per kill, thats fine. But farming for half of the game, and being completely screwed if you run out of mats end game with hardly any hope of being able to farm your way back up is not fine. If you dont bring back the 1500 mat cap, at least bring back the 40% farm rate.  


Both changes were healthy, but you removed the siphon rules because it promoted aggression, yet having 3000 mats, and the insane amount of mobility that is WILLINGLY kept in to the game promotes aggression more than the siphon rules ever did. Its very annoying to be punished for taking fights that you didnt want to be put in to in the first place by either getting pushed by a team or third partied. The siphon rules allowed you to take fights without being heavily punished via loss of mats or health, and made third parties more of a risk than a reward.  


If you get in to a fight, even if you win that fight, you get punished for it. You sacrifice your heals, and if you cant find any heals, rely on the other players carrying heals. It limits what you can carry, and it just makes the game in to a big camp fest in the game.  


If you really wanted to crack down on the amount of aggression in the game, lower the amount of mobility on the map.  
People shouldnt need more than 500 mats to finish a fight, people shouldnt be forced to spend all of early and part of mid game farming mats, people shouldnt be forced to avoid fights unless they want to be put at an extreme disadvantage. People should be allowed to play the game how they want to.  


So please, I beg with tears in my eyes, at least bring back the 1500 mats and 40% farm rate. It makes the game boring having to constantly farm up mats, and having no chance to regain your mats during end game.   


TL;DR bring back the 1500 mats and 40% to keep the campiness to a minimum, and to keep the game from being too slow by having to farm all of early and mid game in order to have a chance to compete against other players. Also you have a chance to regain your mats end game and not be completely doomed if you run out. ",FortNiteBR

It only took me 2 weeks off aim assist to not be potato I've been playing like this since season 5.
I don't die that much but when i do i get instantly headshotted then i look at the gameplay of pro console players/friends its the same. I really don't see anyone outstanding from each other in the console community they all play the same have the same aim. The only thing console players outstand each other in is editing/building

Its fun to laser someone in the head...
That's not the case with aim assist
If you laser someone in head its fun but not if you do all the time its aimbot, I've seen people say you still have to aim at them with your thumbstick. That's not true once you press LT it locks on to them and unless you aim away from them you can't miss.

I might seem whiny but i just think this game is losing its fun. And the skill gap is increasing every update. Hope this gets some attention. I don't want aim assist removed i simply want a nerf i can't take anyone seriously when they're smashing they're LT button with a hammer.

I have more hours in playground practicing building than actually playing which seems counterproductive but it seems like I can't really do anything in the game besides die. So I don't know if I should just go into games and keep dying or try and do the best I can to perfect my building. Or is it the whole ""play more"" thing.

I've played since Season 1 on PS4 (250 wins, average player, father to 2 kids, full time job), and the current state of the game just isn't as fun for me personally anymore. Specifically in Season 8.

I feel that a lot of the players that were casual have moved on to other games; and in combination with the cross-platform changes, it has caused lobbies to be filled with a lot more highly skilled players. I have no real issue with this aspect.

Toward the end of last season I even began doing Candook's edit course and a few other ones for like 10 minutes each night when I signed on, and it did help. I always used to hate this mode, because after I put the kids to bed, I'd want to just hop on and play in public lobbies and just have fun. But it did actually help, and I figured 10 minutes wasn't too bad.

My main issue, and what has specifically irritated me this season is the scrim-style endgames that I encounter 8/10 times in the top 10. I absolutely can't stand that when I try to fight someone, they just continue to turtle and wait for the storm to move to start fighting. I get it... it's a strat.. But for me personally, it is what has made this season so un-fun. I just miss the days where you could have some nice AR, shotgun, and sniper fights between the last 4 or 5 guys, without having to worry about the 10-tick storm.

Just my opinion, I know it's probably not popular, but have a good day Reddit users!",FortNiteBR

  At first I thought it would be fun cause no one will finish well it didn’t everyone still plays aggressive and farming is plain trash like I mean trash. Nothing about Fortnite is fun except the lava game mode which in my opinion needs 50 shields/health per kills cause I can’t ever get health in that cause the game’s ring is trash. Having mats in almost impossible unless a player or team has the mats I need but after I killed them my health is now low and people push because they know I’m low. Making the game more passive will require a lot of work due to the fast now I can third party I fight knowing what they get hit by won’t be healed after they get kill and then I just finish them off.
  In Conclusion, I hope this update gets reversed after the arena is done and pubs are back to the good state they were. These mistakes are the reason apex blew and took the players they did. Listen to the people who like your game not the bots who can’t win without these changes.",FortNiteBR

First, a reminder that all players who compete in the Final Round of the Luxe Cup and other upcoming cash prize tournaments will be required to enable 2FA and link their account to an Epic ID. You can do so by following our guide here: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/2fa.

Also, to be eligible to participate in any Luxe Cup match, a player must be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in such player’s country of residence). Minors must have permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in the Event. All competitors will also be required to acknowledge and accept the official rules in-game before playing. Players must also have a minimum Account Level of 15.

Players who place in the Contenders League in Arena Mode before Round 1 of the Luxe Cup begins will unlock this event in-game. The Luxe Cup will occur across two rounds - Round One (Semi-Finals) on Saturday and Round Two (Finals) on Sunday. Each round will be its own 3 hour session. Hop into the Events tab to find out the times available for your region. Participants will also only be able to play a maximum of 10 matches during each session. 

The top 1500 teams in each region at the conclusion of the Semi-Finals will advance to the Finals the next day. After the Finals have concluded, the top ranked eligible teams in each region will be awarded the following prizes:

The game has been terrible for casual players. Everyone is aggressive, and you get insta thirsted with zero second chances. Go play ranked, and stop complaining about pubs being ruined. Almost all my friends are casuals, and they quit the game because of Fortnite being too difficult now. People have jobs, spouses, kids, etc. Not everyone can play 6-12 hours a day. If you want to complain, complain about the mat farm being nerfed. But don't cry about health on kill when you can easily go into a ranked game and get what you want.",FortNiteBR

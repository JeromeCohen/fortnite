Starting with the update tomorrow, you’ll start to notice “Pop-Up Cups” within the events tab as apart of our online tournaments system. 

What’s a ‘Pop-Up Cup’?

It’s a way for us to try out different settings in a more competitive environment. Make sure you stay updated on the rules for each Pop-Up via the in-game events tab!

Think of these ‘Pop-Ups’ as the equivalent of Competitive LTMs where we can try out large adjustments in a more competitive environment. Let us know what you think each time we run a new Pop-Up Cup.

We know that. Some love it and some hate it, but the biggest issue of all is that it's BEEN DONE. 

And now we are USED to it. Everyone is begging for the redeploy to be gone. (""Everyone"" is a generalization, I realize) But EPIC has backed themselves into a corner. If they take it out of the game, after it's been in for a few weeks, the following is what will likely crowd this sub:

""I was so used to redeploy that now I'm dying from fall damage every game! PUT IT BACK IN!""

""The game feels so much slower now! I like being about to move across the map at a faster pace!"" 

""Why does EPIC change the fundamentals of the game CONSTANTLY! Pick something and stick to it!""

Do I like glider redeploy? Not when I get 3rd partied out of no where every game...

Do I dislike glider redeploy? Not when I land at paradise and the circle is in Junk, or when I see an engagement that can be 3rd partied ;) 

Point is, what we hate about it are all things we take advantage of when they benefit us and help our K/D. And we hate when we are on the losing end of the mechanic...

If this ruins the game for you, then stop making yourself miserable by playing it. If you no longer enjoy playing, take a break. But now that they've kept it in the game for this long, they will have backlash for removing it - and I can almost bet that the game will feel much slower (something people on this sub complained about before this mechanic).

**Vault:**Double barrel,re-deploy,gapler,freezing trap

Double barrel became so irrevelant,its just too rng based.

Re-deploying is very annoying,getting constatly jumped on by ppl is out of hand,the map is just full of ramps,you cant punish people who build up too high,etc.

Grapler with the re-deploy is ridicolus,even without that its just not needed...

Freezing trap is just a joke and just takes a slot,its kinda useless.

Mid games became so boring,15ppl in a very big circle is not fun.Just make the circles go faster.Put back bouncers,and increase its drop rate,same with the jumppads.I would even prefer to take out the smg's aswell,and put back the old ones.We also need a sound effect when getting out of materials,a similar one when you running out of ammo.I wont even talk about the bloom,which is also a joke.

2) More Aggressive 3rd partying because they just build up super high and beam you and even if you shoot them down, they just do it again, and it’s not just one person who does this btw.

3) No down/heal time between fights because everyone hears shots, builds up then jumps on you, and with the spray meta they W key you and force you to build non-stop, but since everyone around you heard the shots, they build up, jump on you, and spray you from 10 different angles. Then you die before you can even pop a shield.

4) Waste mats on build fight just to have them fly away, then forced to give opponent advantage if you chase because they land first and can beam you out of the sky / build up and get high ground on you because they land before you.

5) Forced in all modes when nobody asked for it. Didn’t even put it in its own LTM to test it out. (Souring 50v50 doesn’t count).

6) Messes with the skill gap and takes away from the core mechanics that made the game great in the first place.

Overall it just makes the game less enjoyable when all these things are combined.",FortNiteBR

A discussion about redeploy.","Hey all, not like it matters much, but I've been playing since the beta as a Founder and have played BR pretty regularly ever since release. And honestly, the recent ability to redeploy your glider any time has gone against so many key things fundamental to Fortnite.

1. Fall Damage. Fall Damage has been key to the game from day One. Whether you need a way down from a cliff, or you're punishing an overconfident builder, fall damage has been important and now its nothing. ""Oh, but fall damage is still a thing!"" Yeah, if you somehow don't know or forget to redeploy. As soon as you start falling you just spam jump and you're safe. Cliffs and mountains mean nothing anymore as well as you can just fly.

2. Mobility vehicles. We have 3 vehicles now: The shopping cart, ATK, and Quadcrasher. Thats 3 ways to traverse the map that are absolutely useless now that its faster to just build a ramp and fly.

3. Mobility items. Part of inventory management includes taking ""just in case"" items over other weapons. Do I take the grenade launcher or keep the super impulses in case I need to get down from a high height? Now, everyone's just carrying as many weapons as possible because there's no other threat anymore. Not to mention I impulse someone to push them into the storm but now they just fly right back in after taking minimal damage.

4. RNG. Here's the most controversial one that I've touched on in the past points as well. I see a lot of people claim that glider redeploy ""removes the RNG"" and makes every fight fair! yay happy happy fair fights for all! But to me, the point of a Battle Royale is that its not supposed to be fair. Sometimes I'll get screwed over, sometimes other people get screwed over, sometimes its a fair fight. ""But it helps people who get screwed by the first circle!"" But that's the point to me. If I land Lonely, Im risking a far circle for the ability to loot with mostly less people. Or maybe I get the circle and an entire place to myself, risk and reward.

That's the main point I wanna end on. To me, Fortnite for the longest time was about risk and reward and that's been removed with the addition to glider redeploy. The risk of falling, taking an item you might not need, using a vehicle that makes a lot of noise has all been negated.Thanks for reading, lemme know what you think. ",FortNiteBR

The Bouncer doesn't allow you to travel incredibly fast. It also locks you to a forced trajectory making it possible for a skilled player being pushed to punish the attacker by lining up a shotgun or sniper shot. The glider allows you to do absurdly effective dodging putting you at little risk of taking damage when you go in for a close landing. The Bouncer requires you to predict when you are about to get dropped, rather than just reacting to it. Predictions require more skill and are more fun to pull off than reactions. On top of all of that you need to manage how you use your Bouncers, since you have a limited amount of them, and can't just spam Bouncers.

In short; bring back Bouncers as they demand more skill and smarts than glider redeploy, and didn't cause constant 3rd partying.",FortNiteBR

Zombies should have been an ltm like it is now and glider redeploy should have been put into its own playlist to test. Now since they just shoved glider redeploy down everyone’s throat, the community is split with either people that want it in or don’t want it in.

You may be upset that another person killed you.....but just because you were so focused on fighting and then someone else killed you, does not mean it needs to be turned into some term to explain the fact that streamers and others can’t handle dying in a video game.

If someone from outside the game was affecting the outcome then that might be considered “3rd partying”, but the way they use the term now is just a ridiculous excuse and is leading to extra hate this game doesn’t deserve. It’s an irresponsible way to rationalize why you are losing. It sounds good and really does seem like an easy excuse to explain why you didn’t win, but in reality it’s you vs. 99 others and someone could be on the mountain watching you the whole time waiting for you to just stop, and so when you fight with another person and he snipes you is it 3rd party?

Now I have seen a lot of players complain about the ability to redeploy gliders 
And everyone has a different view on this but the two most common complains I hear are 
1-There should be fall damage 
(I do kinda agree with this point but this isn’t a big deal FOR ME)
2-Fights are easy to escape 
(This is my main issue with this feature 
Because I hate wasting most of my materials and at the end they just jump and glide away)

It should be in game modes like 50 v 50 and Disco Domination not in a game mode that Victory Royale’s count mainly Solo,Duo and Squads

And if they are really gonna push it and put it in all the game modes then it should be only usable a certain number of times 

And balloons are the solution to this 
Because balloons are more balanced 
They are limited and they serve the same purpose but they are more balanced because when you use them you become an easy target and you can easily escape a fight with them without at least getting damaged from enemy fire 

And instead of redeploying a glider to prevent fall damage after you reach the maximum hight you can use less balloons to do you don’t take fall damage 



This is just my opinion 
And this is my first time posting on this subreddit so please be kind

I should probably now explain the view point I'm coming from I'm a girl who loves to play big armoured bad ass woman in video games and it really sucks in fornite the only skins I can find (not saying this is it but it's all I could find) that really match their male counterpart are the season 2 knight skins and the football skins (and I'm not a fan of football so to me this skin is eh).

Just an idea, so don’t slate me in the comments if you think it’s stupid. 

Basically, make a throwable item that creates a metal 1x1 which enemies cannot break for 20 seconds once thrown. It will give everyone time to pop any meds (chug included). You can leave anytime. Once the timer is up the 1x1 can be broken. Also, enemies have no idea you’re in there, unless they can hear you using meds or moving. From the inside it could look like the back of a trap? There’s also a count-down on screen for the team who threw it but not for enemies. I think maybe some distinctive sound could alarm when it’s finished.  Another thing, maybe for solos its a 1x1, duos, a 2x1 and squads, a 2x2. Should you be able to stack a few of them? Also, what rarity? 

Possible downfalls include excessive turtling. So it’s important to see how many you can stack by still making it fair. Enemies can’t do anything for 20 seconds so it could be too long. Another downside is problems with the storm. 

I do think it could potentially be a fix for keeping glider redeployment in some form and keeping a lot of people happy.

&amp;#x200B;

This would mean you would have to actually give up a slot if you wanted redeploy capabilities. Hence, less running from fights, more fall damage, and a huge drop in 3rd partying.. all of which is killing the game right now.  

  

I think for the first time, most of the community and player base has come together to agree this needs to go. That says a lot, and I'm hoping it gets fixed before a substantial amount of the player base just gives up and walks away. I know my squad and I have only played like 10% of what we normally would because it's just not as appealing to get 3rd partied non stop every game.

With the glider redeploy in its current state and the introduction of the spam meta, I can see EPIC are attempting to make the game more enjoyable for the casual which populates 90% of the whole player base. That I can understand. What I can’t understand is why they’ve introduced a mechanic that narrows the chance of these casuals being able to be picked up off the floor and carry on with the game. You go down, 9 times out of 10 your going back to the lobby. How can that be considered fun for those who pick up this game every now and then. ",FortNiteBR

Yes the redeploy can be annoying when you build battle someone and waste all your mats just for them to run away and hide or when you get third partied. However, I’m enjoying it somehow. It allows me to play more  aggressive, or defend and hunker down until I get my chance to strike. 

I’m by no means a great player and I often get thrashed by better players or 3rd party-ers , but the only reason you see top tier players complain about this meta is due to the fact that they get killed more often by your everyday schmo’s (i.e. me). I guess that’s what epic is going for, making it a more even playing ground, seeing as to how this technically isn’t a “competitive game”. And honestly, I don’t see epic taking away redeploy anytime soon.

Mind these things tho please!

- Old weapons who didn’t got renewed should be coming back. Tactical SMG, Drum Gun, Guided missle and such. (If they were to OP against some mechanic or other gun make a damage nerf/bug, magazine nerf/buf whatever nerf/buf that is simple.)

- Old mechanics should be back too, such as double pumping for instance. (Yes this might seem OP, but it’s and huge fun factor. Even getting killed by a double pump didn’t break the replay factor)

- New weapons can stay, but things such as ATK’s, Quads, Rifts (to go), grappler and chiller traps should not be coming along.

I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that Epic said it was a trial for one week. And then, without offering any true reasoning other than a short, vague statement, they extended it for the foreseeable future. 

Most people here either love it or hate it; I've seen very little from people who are sat on the fence. 

My suggestion would be two playlists; have standard solo, duo and squads without re-deploy, and then a re-deploy playlist which revolves from solo to duo to solo every three or four days. 

This way, it's down to each individual which version of Fortnite they want to play. A lot of us, myself included, want re-deploy gone out of the game. After all of this time playing the game, such a huge game-changing feature shouldn't be forced on us in every single mode.

If a section of the community want re-deploy, give them a single re-deploy playlist.

It's been shown time and time again that Fortnite has more than a big enough player pool to extend to an added playlist. 

This way, everyone's happy. Or at least make this change for the time being while Epic figures out what direction they want to go in, because more and more of my friends are playing less due to re-deploy. ",FortNiteBR

I'm an average player, decent at building, my aim's decent enough to snag me a few kills throughout the game, and my gamesense is, again, decent.

When engaged in a battle, and I come out victorious, I can guarantee 99.9% of the time, you will have a cycle of people third partying against you.

So the story is:

Around 7 weeks ago or so at the beginning of season 6, I purchased 1000 V-Bucks and the Starter pack which gives you 600 V-Bucks. I did this so I would have enough v-bucks to buy the 25 tier bundle, irrelevant, but just putting this out there in case you want to know why or whatever. Next day I look at my receipts and I see that yesterday Epic Games charged me for 1000 vbucks (8 pounds) and 600 vbucks (4 pounds) which was fine, but then I realized that there was a second 1000 v bucks purchase a minute later or so after I bought those V-Bucks. So I was like oh what did I accidentally purchase another 1000 V-Bucks? I went and checked my game, and there were no extra 1000 vbucks in there. So basically epicgames just charged me 8 pounds for no reason and gave me nothing for those 8 pounds. The mistake I made was that after this I went and told the bank that I have nt authorized this purchase and haven’t gotten anything from it when I should’ve first went to EpicGames Customer Support before reporting it to my bank. I was like well, everything will be fine I told them they charged me and gave me nothing so i’ll probably just get a refund or epic will give me the 1000 vbucks I deserve for the money I paid extra. Well, I did not get any of those 2 options but what I did get was my account disabled for ‘’charging back money/fraud’’ 7 weeks later after this happened. I tried emailing EpicGames but 2 weeks later my account still hasn’t been unbanned.  I have bought a lot of skins in this game and also bought STW and have been supporting the game since October 2017 and got myself around 200 wins. So even though it’s just an account on a game those items are still worth money and all the time i spent into it is valuable to me.

What’s your opinion on this? 
And if you read the whole thing and wish to help me, please share this with your friends or try getting an Epic employee’s attention on this post.
Thank you.",FortNiteBR

Disco mode runs worse for me with 20 less on each team than it did before with 50 on each team.

Yeah. I barely do either. A lot of people agree that this mechanic has made the game much worse. It enables ridiculously easy third partying, which makes my squad and I genuinely scared to get into a fight knowing that we'll be instantly jumped on before we can heal by three other squads. Then, it greatly reduces the usefulness of plenty of mobility items (such as the chiller, which is now being complained about because people have forgotten it even had a use). Lastly, it destroys the pacing of the game and practically disables fall damage, meaning that there is no consequence for getting into a huge build battle, and making it much easier to run out of materials mid game.

I'm not going to pretend this mechanic is ""killing the game"". It's not. People are still playing, and Epic is still rolling in the cash with their new football skins. But over time, slowly, the consequences of this mistake will catch up to them.",FortNiteBR

Removing aim assist altogether would be absurd. But since I'll be criticizing the way aim assist works in game I'll mention that I am a PS4 player, using a regular DS4 with claw to avoid ""he's just a triggered PC player"" type comments.

What is aim assist?

Aim assist consists of the *different* ways it can be made easier for console players to aim at targets, seeing that with a small analog stick, the user has less control compared to using a mouse. With a mouse on PC it is much easier to achieve a balance between precision and speed.

How does aim assist work in Fortnite BR?

When you turn the aim assist option on, you enable two key benefits which are not communicated in game:

'Slowdown' assist - This is a standard in many shooters, such as in CoD, and has the effect of lowering your sensitivity when aiming at an enemy. It makes small adjustments when aiming down sights easier and is a good advantage for console to help compete with PC.

'Auto-aim' assist - This form of aim assist triggers at the moment of aiming down sights. When the user's hipfire crosshair appears slightly off target but within an invisible 'aura' around the player, a tap of the left trigger makes that small adjustment which would have otherwise been done manually. 


The issue with auto aim is that it corrects the user's aim automatically while slowdown compliments the user's efforts to be precise, thus it provides too much of an advantage on top of the already strong slowdown in the game. To add to this I can mention how easily auto aim can be abused through rapid zooming in and out for noticeably easier tracking, especially with SMGs in CQC. It's not exactly skillful to spam L2 and get an advantage out if it. PC players cannot replicate this, yet console players can replicate steady PC aim through their own input + slowdown assist, which is fair.

This is why I think the 1/2 of aim assist that is auto aim should be removed. It would satisfy the concerns of PC pros and at the same time remain strong for console players. It would match the way it works in CoD where auto aim does ""not affect multiplayer""

By the way I don't blame players like Aydan for using it. It's there and it's effective. I've used it too. It's just that you can't turn it off without turning off slowdown at the same time and console players need slowdown unless you are challenging yourself.",FortNiteBR

I’ve effectively given up on Solos and play the other game modes. Here’s the problem. I have some wins in all game modes except solo. I feel awful for not having any, and want just one. Should I take my chances and go back? I’m not great, but I’m not complete garbage either, and can outbuild most people if I have the mats. Been playing since Season 4.

However, it's got me thinking: Won't Balloons just take over from Re-Deploy?  


Assuming that EPIC keep the ability to Re-Deploy after using a Balloon (because if they don't, Balloons will be almost completely worthless), then players will just use 1 Balloon, jump off a ramp (maybe towards people they can 3rd party), or away from a build battle, and then Re-Deploy just like before.  


This will mean that only players who get Balloons will be able to Re-Deploy, but they'll have limited uses, so they'll have to be a little more strategic about when to use them.   


\-Is that a good thing?   
\-Does it mean that people will have a RNG advantage just because they found Balloons?  
\-Is it more balanced because Balloons take up a slot?",FortNiteBR

It's like saying every black person in the world can sprint as fast as Usain Bolt or every Asian person can be as swift as Bruce Lee.

Sure, you can be proud, but don't for a second say they represent the entire race's skill as if you can grab a controller player off the street and win any tournaments.  Nick and Aydan are olympic status controller players who can compete with other olympic status PC players but they 99% will never be able to consistently outclass the Usains and Bruces of the PC world.

The average PC player &gt; the average controller player due to their movement, aim, and technological advantages alone.

The main reason Nick is getting such high kill games almost every game on his YouTube channel is because he's a god amongst germs in pub lobbies and he (along with most other YTers) post their best games.

There are two points to this random post.  For the childish comments that keep saying ""finally, show them we can hold our own"" yadda yadda and to explain that good controller players can't fully compete with good PC players especially in tournaments.  

So the takeaway? Epic's data will be skewed once they see the results of their general tournament and for younger audiences to just start thinking more into what they say.

Am I off-base? This is just one of those thoughts I've been having so I could delete this if I'm missing something.

Unplayable.,"My normal ping is around 10-20. The past month or so it runs around 30-40 for around a minute or two and then spikes to 300+ for 30 seconds. This repeats through out the entire match. Its completely unplayable. I have ran other games and speed tests on my computer. My ping is steady in all other games and multiple speed tests have shown a steady ping of about 12. What is happening??

I have found similar posts all around the internet with everyone agreeing its an issue and EPIC seems to have not addressed it in any of the threads, nor have the people reporting the issue ever gotten a response.

Lots of posts from July and April. Some in September. 

Does ANYONE know a fix for this issue or what is going on? It's a very strange problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before you ask, yes I have ran it with all other programs closed. Yes I have tried taking server selection off auto and have tried every manual server location. Yes I am on WiFi, no a hard line is not an option. No ""Get a wired connection"" is not an acceptable. I live in the Bay Area. There is no reason a game shouldn't be able to run in a reasonably playable state over WiFi.

I am not attacking the game. Dying does not = no one playing, just that the player base seems to be slowly decreasing.


I have noticed many of my friends, real life and online do not play Fortnite as often(this began Season 5). I've discussed this with many of them and they agree that their friends are also not on Fortnite as often these days. We were all diehard fans, but something seems to have changed. I have been here since mid Season 1 and I don't feel as if the playerbase has evolved for the better.


Even streamers seem to be getting bored, you can see it in their demeanor and Ninja seems to be playing Realm Royale more often, it sometimes feels as if they are just pumping out videos just for revenue and to remain relevant. Many streamers are saying that Epic seems to be prioritising casual, lower skilled players, which from my experience, is what happens before a game goes downhill(WoW, Runescape, LoL etc). Paragon ultimately failed, and I feel that is partly because Epic did not to listen to player feedback, even from comp players and made a series of horrible decisions. Fortnite is not at this point yet, but I'm worried it might descend to that level eventually.


The level of skill needed has definitely decreased. It went from double shotguns to SMG spam. The bloom is still very bad. I was hoping for more balanced weapons this season and a variety of possible play styles. The swap delay wasn't my favorite additon either, it felt clunky and killed a bit of that ""fast paced"" feel. Constantly evolving the meta to cater to new players is causing slow degradation. Not to say there have been no awesome updates.


I know many won't agree with me. Honestly, I see this game remaining solid for another couple of seasons, but if the current trend continues, I think many long-time players will go elsewhere.

What is the reason to complete the remaining weekly challenges?,"I already reached tier 100 (like probably a lot of players) and now I don't find the motivation to complete the remaining weekly challenges based on the following points:

* There are no rewards other than those banners (not really a great thing for me and I'm sure I'm not alone here)
* Since in this season we don't need to grind for the last level of the tier 100 skin, there is no reason to try to get the XP from the challenges.

Since there are still challenges, there should be rewards for completing those challenges!

In my opinion, Epic should try to implement a reward system more based on the weekly challenges and not so much on time played (currently: more time played -&gt; more XP -&gt; more level -&gt; more stars earned from level up -&gt; more tiers) ... or simply should get the grind for the last level of the tier 100 skin back :)

So I've looked everywhere and tried many things to try fix this and it seems like my problem is sort of unique from what I can tell.

I can't play the game in Fullscreen. Simple as that. Let me explain.

If I play the game in borderless window. It runs 1080p and everything is ok in a way. But I get horrible performance that way because it's not a fully dedicated application that's running because I don't have an amazing PC.

If I run the game in windowed mode. It runs in every single form but you can't play a competitive game like that.

If I run it in Fullscreen mode however... It only runs in 4:3 ratio and not the standard 16:9 (or is it 16:10) and I can't change that anywhere. There's only 2 resolution options available for me and I can't use any of them as the image is super blurry and I can't see anything.

Does anyone have any fixes?

TL:DR 
Fullscreen Mode only gives me 4:3 aspect ratio and I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Competitive is good**

I think that a competitive mode is very important for this game to keep going strong, we have seen how popular Fortnite is as an esport, so I don't see why competitive mode would be bad.

Adding a competitive mode would make it a lot easier for pros to get a lot better, and it would be a way for lower skilled players to play against other low skilled players and improve.  A competitive mode would obviously not replace casual modes, because battle royale is supposed to be a battle with no rules or requirements.  Competitive mode would let noobs and pros play with their own skill level, but players could still pubstomp if they wanted.

Most people including me also want a way to test our skill, and something to grind for.  We also want a reward that shows our skill level and dedication to the game.  The solo showdown was a good first step but it was basically just casual solos with a reward. And the reward was just vBucks, which you can just buy, that is thing with the battle pass too, you can just pay your way to the top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seasons**

Many of you may not have played Rocket League, but basically there were competitive seasons that lasted around 2 months.  In these 2 months you had time to  rank up and when the season ended, depending on your rank you got rewards for your rank.  Rocket League had 7 ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Champion, and Grand Champion.  Each rank had 3 tiers and each tier had 5 divisions.  After a competitive match you would go up or down a division (most of the time).  At the end of each season you would get the rewards for your current rank and all ranks below that.  At the start of the next season you would reset to unranked, then you had to play 10 matches to calibrate your rank.  

[Ranking system in Rocket League](https://imgur.com/uyHTvNd)

If the season is too long the people get impatient and lose interest, but if it is too short then people can't get to the rank they want because they don't have the time. So I think it would be good to have 2 competitive seasons per battle pass season.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rewards**

The ranking system obviously wouldn't have to be the exact same as Rocket League (Bronze could be No-Skin), but the tier and division system was very nice because you could tell how close you were to ranking up.  The rewards would have to be more than just a spray or emote, because then no one would care.  A skin might be hard to do but a pickaxe or backbling would be really nice.  I'm not an artist so I can't design anything for you to look at, sorry :(.  The rewards could also change each season like with Rocket League (in order to keep things fresh).

This has been the 2nd week in a row the update with leaked cosmetics was delayed. It’s been delayed until Thursday opposed to Tuesday. The thing that made the Tuesday patch so nice was you could see the leaked skins and determine if you liked them or not. If you didn’t, you’d still have Monday’s shop and Tuesday and Wednesday’s shops to buy a better item than the leaked items. Now that these updates are being delayed, you have to hope for the best that you don’t regret buying an item from Monday or Tuesday night’s shop and then having a better skin with the leaks. It’s a good move for Epic because they’ll make more money, but it’s kind of sad they have to lie about delaying updates so they can make money off people who don’t understand. 

TL;DR- Epic delayed the past 2 updates with weekly items to make more profit since the game has a bunch of people who don’t realize they’re doing this.",FortNiteBR

Stop being a whiny baby. I know it sucks to be finished, but please explain to me why it’s a good idea not to finish? I understand maybe if the person is getting shot but just has to finish you, and it’s irritating, but in any other situation it’s a valid and good thing to do. They can give you more mats, ammo, or heals.  There is nothing wrong with this except you guys are salty because you got downed.  Next time try to outplay them instead of being mad because you got killed. 

For the people talking about giving downed players abilities:

Stop. When you are downed you are supposed to be out of the fight until you are revived.  This is a good game mechanic. Try to beat them or rush with your team so your chance of being Killed when down is minimized. 

Again think of all this from the enemy’s perspective. Imagine you need those mats, or just wanna cut a loose end by lowering  the enemy team count. If you were the enemy would you finish? If you said no, I genuinely want to know why. Honestly.

If you already understand these tips please understand that this is a thread for people who are trying to learn or get better. Many people have anger towards epic for the skill gap, why can’t we try and help out those newer or lesser skilled players? 

•Always be a moving target. 
•Always shoot in volleys. Meaning, plan to take X amount of shots or plan to take X amount of time to shoot before returning to cover. This also minimizes the chance of bloom playing a deciding factor in your fight. 
•Always look for an angle in every fight
whether you’re build battle or on the ground. A perfect angle will put you in a spot where you can melt your enemy but it’s difficult for them to return fire.
•Consider taking the long way if it gives you any sort of tactical or safety advantage. 
•If you’re being SMG spammed, build while moving left right or backwards when being spammed. If you prefer to counter attack with a shotgun, build wall steps backwards and then listen or look for your moment. 
•Remember. If somebody is spamming you, they can’t be building simultaneously. That gives you an opportunity to create a counter flank or disengage. 
•Memorize your build battles! This can come in handy when your opponent decides to move downwards from the build battle. Great for disengagement’s and great for sneak attacks. 
•Memorize noises and what they mean! 
•Don’t be afraid to pass on a fight. 
•If you have issues with getting nervous in fights, remind yourself. What’s the worst thing that can happen if you lose? We have the luxury of simply loading into another game. 

If anybody has anything to add to this list you’re more than welcome! ",FortNiteBR

This way, good aim is still rewarded, but you also don't laser people to death in 0.2 seconds.

The bloom is probably still one of the more annoying things in this game. FSA was a nice idea still.

But I can't be the only one missing shots due to the bloom mechanic, and then in turn getting lasered by someone getting a bit more lucky with their bloom.

In my eyes it feels better to have consistent shooting with downscaled damage, instead of whiffing shots and occasionaly dealing that 70 damage headshot.

The 2 locations that will be changing for season 6 will be Salty Springs and Loot Lake. I’ll start with Salty first. Salty was the location that was directly underneath the largest rift and it had all of the Easter Island heads looking just to the left of it. Also, I watched a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9d5sa8/i_may_know_all_7_rune_locations/?st=JLPN55JP&amp;sh=6e59916e) earlier today that really seals the deal for me. If you don’t want to watch it, then here’s the short summary. Some guy noticed that there was a rune tattooed to Ragnarok’s chest. If you line up the arrows of the tattoo rune to the locations of the cube runes, it lines up perfectly, with Salty in the middle.

Now on to Loot Lake. There are two big pieces of evidence for Loot. First off, the data miners have already found out that the cube’s last stop will be at Loot Lake so that’s pretty big, but there’s one thing I haven’t seen many people talk about. When the rocket launched all the way back in season 4, it went over Loot Lake and got stuck on some sort of force field, just like it did with the big rift over Salty.

If you remember, I said that I had something to say about Tomato. Well I think that there will be a third location that will be changed partway through the season, just like Tomato. I think that location will be Wailing Woods. Wailing Woods does have the bunker which we still have no idea about. It is Black Knight’s skin description. All of the other knights have had their locations changed. Anarchy, Moisty, and Tomato. It’s just logical that Wailing would be gone soon as well.

TL;DR The Cube will end at Loot Lake, after circling Salty. The Cube and its runes will release some sort of energy aimed at Salty, destroying it and the Cube, taking Loot Lake our with it. Also, Wailing will be remade at some point during the season, but not at the beginning.

Anything I missed? Am I wrong/right? ",FortNiteBR

-My thought on this is that the dynamite could be used to blow a small divot into the areas of the map that typically can't be harvested (mostly grass in open fields).


-The top would be left exposed so you'd have to cover it up yourself, thus making you at least somewhat visible.


-The explosion would always blow out the same amount of terrain, presumably about the size of a 1x1. 


-Your free hiding spot would come at the cost of a very noisy explosion.


-Could be used to sit beneath a 1x1, hide from other players, etc.; a very camper-friendly tool.


-Minimal damage to players and structures... I would want the main purpose of this to be a better camping tool, not to have a broken explosive in the game.

There are a couple of issues that have led me to think this way about the games current status and I will explain them to you now.

Firstly, the meta. Recently I've just been so bored with the meta as when I get into a build battle or a close ranged fight or someone I know that they have got a pump/heavy and an smg, or have either solo or two smgs. You will sometimes get the rare person who plays with a solo tac/heavy but I think it is the worst meta there ever has been. I understand that I'm definitely not the first person to bring this up as a well know call out now is 'fUCkiNg sPAm MeTa' but it is honestly so bad. The spam meta is so boring and allows people with hardly any skill to get kills and even wins. I have a friend who has been playing for about a month and a half and who is absolutely awful. He's your typical defaulty boi. However, he was able to get a solo win with 4 kills by spraying people with a minigun and an smg the whole game. Imo this should not happen. I think the spam meta mostly affects console players as the aim assist is devastating.

Secondly, the game is just feeling dry and repetitive. Many of my friends are feeling the same way about this and you probably are too. I feel as though the game is just not as dynamic as it once was. EPIC are trying to add all of these new items such as the shockwave nade and the clinger, but without a proper change to how people play all these items are worthless. They spice up the game a little bit but that is all. People  should have there own gameplay style not just have a shotgun and spray in their inventory. EPIC needs to make massive changes too all of the weapons in the game right now to allow for different types of play style and not just one boring meta.

After I saw more and more people getting banned for no appropriate reason I decided to post this. I am a casual pc player being very good at Counter-Strike and playing fortnite with friends because its fun. One day i decided to cheat at GTA 5 because I was lacking financially. So I did a file that prevented anyone (except for a few) to get data from my pc. I got the money and stuff and so I decided to play fortnite. I went in for a playground match with my friends and I disconnected. I thought that was the file (C:Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts) so I deleted it. Next day I still got disconnected and the next day my Account got deactivated. So I made a new Account and contacted Epic Games. After making a new Account I realized I got IP/Hardware banned. And I contacted Epic Games why exactly I got banned and this was their answer:

Hello My name, 

Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.

If you are getting the “IP, VPN, machine, or cheating” persistently over a period of time, it is likely that your machine itself is banned.

We kick and/or ban players and machines based on the game being modified / tampered with, cheat software found running while playing Fortnite, and other ways of cheating.

We then kick users that play on machines associated with previously banned accounts to prevent cheaters from returning to Fortnite.

This means if you share a machine with anyone else and he/she cheats, your account won’t be able to play on that machine either. You can still play using this Epic Account on a different machine though.

Epic Games Player Support does not have any ability to bypass this kick behavior.

Regards,

Santumyar

Want to know what accomplishes this nostalgia? New maps.,"I’m serious EPIC.  If you’re idea for re-amping Fortnite is to have Kevin roll around the map the map and have some lighting strikes and do some small touches to a few POI’s will not create as much hype as you think it will. With the introduction of the sand island, the excitement and freshness lasted less then a week. I can’t tell you the amount of success this game will see further into the future with the introduction to new terrain. It was the most exciting part of Fortnite when it was released was the feeling of the unexplored. 

You could profit big time off of maps. A new map for 1000v bucks or 13.49$ or whatever. I think it’s extremely necessary that maps are eventually looked into.",FortNiteBR

Yeah sure, you spent 20 dollars for that Ravager backbling, but that doesnt mean it has to stay that way forever, It does not mean you should be entitled to determine how things stay in the future, but because you will do nothing but whine and complain on the Sub about how it is unfair of epic to change it, you are singlehandedly holding back something good the rest of the community could benefit from.

Not only would you make money, but veteran players get to show off their seniority. ‬

For example: Blue Team Leader has a blue band around her bicep. A form of bicep bling can be added to the game that has a color representing which wave the skin was purchased on. The bling can be enabled or disabled for the players that wish to show off seniority and those who don’t. 

While this really isn’t a monumental issue in the game, I think seniority with buying skins is a large reason people buy them in the first place. Skins being rereleased with no method of showing “veteran-ship” makes me not want to buy skins as much as I once did around the time Bunny Brawler, and Power Chord came out. ",FortNiteBR

System. I play on xbox, and as good as xbox is, i just cant play fortnite with a controller.

Skill gap. Ok ill admit that im not that good, but everyones been playing the game for so long their just too good.

Experience. I said ive been in since january seas 2, but i missed seas 3 and half seas 4 and seas 5 is bad. Im just not into grinding and pointlessness.

Th new fortnite. Fortnites not how it used to be, and it will never be the same. I hate the new stuff coming in and everyone is just  a sweaty streamer.

Stages 3-4 Do 2 ticks of damage, meaning you have to hit the medkit at 22hp or higher

I'm by no means bad at the game, I've been playing games since I was 3 and playing fortnite since November on and off and have a decent enough 60+ wins but this new season has driven myself and all my friends away from it. We used to have enough people online to fill 3 squads now we can't even get one. 

Definitely not buying a battle pass next season and I can imagine a lot are in the same boat. Something has to be done to split the casual gamers from the people who have 1,000's of matches played and play it religiously.

Such a  good MMR for casual and competitive play lists in rocket league. Let's people progress but still play against players who are around the same skill level.

Here's what will happen.,"On Sunday, I came up with [The Hexagon Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9abkct/tracking_the_cube_event_megathread/e58i0lc/)  
On Monday, I [updated it](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9abkct/tracking_the_cube_event_megathread/e59f1fb/) - [Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/TMGTZP3)  
Now, the mobile players have figured it all out using the rendered grass method  
u/DatCringeyGuy - coordinated the effort and made [this](https://i.redd.it/afhito985ck11.jpg)  
u/CharizardFactory - made [this](https://imgur.com/a/C4efUcy)  
And a nice one from u/dididead - [Neat](https://i.imgur.com/OtrXT96.jpg)  
These are almost certainly the correct locations  
[Here is how close I got](https://imgur.com/gallery/CH3xFDS). The purple is what I had predicted and the pink is what it will be.  
Now although slightly apart, this seems too close to be a coincidence. The basis for my initial prediction was that the runes would form a hexagon that is perfectly centered on the map but now that the actual locations have been found the hexagon is still present but hardly a hexagon anymore - [Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ycqr1Px)  
It all boils down to what did Epic actually intend to do? The Cube came down in a flash of lightning from the large rift meaning that it was sent either by the Visitor or by the Enforcers to take down the Visitor who has breached the galactic code by creating the rifts (as evidenced by the loading screen where the enforcers come back with the motel sign in search of 'Restoring balance and order'. It is a non hostile entity that purposefully avoids populated areas and regenerates your shield but will not refrain from harming you if you try and damage it.  
Another interesting point is that of Drift. If you look at the enforcer loading screen, he seems to be putting on his mask. He is hiding himself from the enforcers as they want to return him to where he came from but he has become attached to the fortnite realm (and bright bomber). Epic's 'agents' had earlier said that Drift's final form is an important clue. His final form has pink lightning, similar to the lightning that spawned the cube. There's something important here that I seem to be missing.  
When all the runes are placed, it will move to the lake and activate. I still do not know what it will do but the pattern of the runes is the basis for this activation and all seven need to be perfectly positioned for something to happen.  
If someone can link all the clues together and come up with a unified theory that would be just great",FortNiteBR

In that time I've played at my friend's house who I'll call noot. Noot had all the season 2&amp;3 items so I played with them. When I first put on that sparkle specialist and did the worm I couldn't describe the feeling... because I didn't feel anything. It was just another skin in the inventory. It was nothing special. It was just the same gameplay but with a different skin. The only thing that stood out were the emotes but those got stale quick.

Judging by the pattern of movement that Kevin is currently undergoing, it looks like he is trying to find something. People have already speculated that it is heading in the direction of Wailing Woods because of the (sort of) symmetrical path it has taken. I have an idea that the force fields that Kevin generates are actually a way for him to search for something within a certain area (most likely underground, out of sight).

Just looking at the ground that Kevin has covered it gives me the impression he's not sure where he's going and clearly doesn't know the map at all. He is alien to it. Aliens have their reasons to visit planets. Usually they are looking for something that will benefit them that they don't have on their own planet. 

I have reason to believe there is something hidden in the chamber in Wailing Woods that Kevin would find useful and has been sent here to find.

All of us know that Kevin is quite a peaceful being. He minds his business and only retaliates accordingly. However, he may become frustrated over time if he does not find what he is looking for (much like in real life, we get frustrated when we can't find something). Therefore, he may become more destructive and less composed as his journey continues. Perhaps this connects with other theories about Kevin destroying certain POI (possibly Loot Lake).

With Fortnite being obviously one of the most popular games to date, I’ve been curious on why that is for the past couple of months. I first tried out FortniteBR when it was in beta before the whole battle pass thing and everyone was a default. I thought I would enjoy it since I thought the whole shooter battle royal concept sounded really fun and I came from both a competitive CoD and Overwatch background, also only having PS4 as a platform and not PC made me even more curious since PS4 didn’t have H1Z1 (at the time) or PUBG. But after a couple play session it just felt clunky and inconsistent so I left it alone. Time passed, and now we have Fortnite as the top trending subject all over the place. Thinking it might feel better I ended up trying it out again (around the beginning of every new season and then again last week.) But time and time again it still just doesn’t click with me. Considering my background, it has nothing to do with what types of games I actually enjoy or something like that. My problems include the complete randomness of every match. Not only with loot drop but with the building mechanic, supposedly the most skilled gapped mechanic, which just makes the environment of every battlefield completely different and unpredictable. Now this may sound interesting and healthy for the longevity of a game, but when you give players such a versatile mechanic that’s based on resource accumulation, that’s when things become annoyingly unpredictable, which doesn’t really provide space for legitimate strategy. Basically the game feels like I’m playing Hearthstone but every match up me and my opponent are given random classes with random decks, something a shooter, especially one striving to make it into the competitive scene, should probably not be aiming for. As a side note, 100% of my victory royals (about 7 due to the small about of time I’ve put into the game compared to other ‘experienced players’) feel undeserving and just random occurrences, while about 90% of my deaths feel just the same.

I may need surgery that would put me under weeks of rest (my groovy spine syndrome is finally doing me in, can hardly move at times— luckily the thumbs still are working just fine!), and I am absolutely awful at this game. I have one Solo Victory, and I’ve played since Season 1. Never spent a dime until I came back from a huge break. I became active again in Season 3 but my skill level is atrocious since now I see the game has evolved entirely from skilled gun combat to whoever builds the fastest. What I need from you fellow Internet folk is tips to help me earn XP and Battle Pass Tiers as fast as possible in case I really do get put out of the loop for nearly a month. Should I play for hours on end? Take breaks between games? Practice in PlayGround?

If it helps with anything, I play on XBOX One w/ sensitivity 7 &amp; 7, controls on combat pro.

10 seconds to drink and get full hp and shields.
The downside now is that the shields and health go back to what they were before drinking over time. Maybe based on storm damage so further into the game these are less useful as they tick faster and faster. That would keep medkits a must have end game and no one could blame an overpowered item for the win xD

What's the use of this item?


None. It teaches Fortnite players that trees are important.


Fortnite influences 40 million+ players that destroying trees is OK.


It's sad to say, I see many Fortnite players destroying trees like they don't care at all.


Today we kill them without any reason, And tomorrow they will extinct every season.


Trees create an ecosystem to provide habitat and food for birds and other animals. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and potentially harmful gasses, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, from the air and release oxygen. One large tree can supply a day's supply of oxygen for four people.


Without the plants on our planet the evolution of life here would have been impossible. Plants were instrumental in the supply of oxygen in the atmosphere. Thus the stage was set for Adam and Eve. And now there are about five billion people living on the earth. So we must acknowledge the importance of plants in our life. The trees are an integral species of the plant genus in existence on Mother Earth. The trees have played a very important role in the past and continue to play even now. We are indebted to trees for soil and climate as well as for their direct contribution to our homes to hospitals and to our factories.


It is quite amazing the ways in which trees support life. Fuel wood building materials, and a wide range of food and medicines and other products are obtained from forests. Approximately trees range across 30 per cent of the earth’s surface. They produce and sustain large stocks of biomass and nurture the greatest number of plant and animal species.


Forests also play a significant role in the recycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen. They affect climatic conditions such as rainfall and temperature. Moreover, they are the fountain heads of rivers. They play the additional role of the largest gene reservoirs on the planet earth. They are the site for the discuss and development of new species.


Perhaps the greatest gift the forests have given us is wood. It is one of the first raw materials that we used It quite possibly could be our last. Almost every major industry is dependent upon the forest, and its products at one stage or another. A house wall built of wood requires 20 per cent less energy for heating, and 30 per cent less for cooling than a wall of any other construction material. Moreover, wood provides hardboard, plywood, veneer, chipboard, particle board which we use for furnishing our homes and offices.


One of the principal uses of wood is the production of paper. Paper is an indispensable and perhaps also irreplaceable medium of civilization. It is not surprising, therefore, that our annual consumption of industrial Timber is 1.5 billion tons, an amount, which exceeds plastic and steel combined.


Almost, all medicines are herbal in their origin. Without forest and plants, we will be deprived of many things, which come from them.


To conclude trees are the great providers protectors. Their services are many. They help preserve our species in more way than we can imagine. Without forest full of stately trees, our planet would be the poorer and a lot less beautiful than it is today.",FortNiteBR

1.  If I buy the battle pass, will I get everything I earn in season 2?  I thought this was pretty self explanatory, but then I got confused by something about purchasing tiers.  So the way I'm understanding it is... I pay real money (10 bucks) for a thousand v bucks, which I purchase the pass with. Then I will get all the stuff I've earned (tier 22) and all the other stuff I'm able to get before the season ends in 26 days?

2.  Some remedial research has led me to the conclusion that the best way to earn v bucks is by purchasing the pve.  Is this correct?  If so, is there any disadvantage of buying it via the hardcopy?  (I have a gamestop gift card).

3.  I play on console (ps4).  Sometimes I'll be in Rambo mood and take some impossible pot shots at guys across the map that are just a spec on my 65 inch tv.  But then the guy will whip around and kill me in a few shots.  How in F is this happening over and over?  Is this just incredible aim assist that I haven't figured out how to use yet?  Is it just that I'm taking pot shots at John Wick?  Is it that ps4 has aimbot cheaters?  I'm truly baffled by this. 

4.  Another problem I'm having is that I'll get in a fight, I'll see my shots land, I'll see the red X, I'll see the number of damage I did to him and then I'll lose the fight. When I switch to spectator mode of the guy who killed me, he'll have full health and full shield. When I check my stats it says that I inflicted zero damage.  What the F?  Is this just lag on my end?  

5.  And finally, I know that Epic gives their users what they want more than any company ever. Do you think a majority of people would like to do away with aim assist?  I would LOVE for them to get rid of it. Then I wouldn't be questioning the incredible shots that are killing me.  I can just smirk in awe and try not to throw my controller as my opponent does the worm on my loot.",FortNiteBR

I think if Epic could rework this to have a more explode-on-contact feel, then it would be better attuned to Fortnite's style and gameplay. Any thoughts?

Edit: 
People have suggested making the AOE smaller or making it a shorter time length. 

I don't think it needs a drastically smaller AOE (maybe a little bit) because it would be too easy for enemies to estimate where you are. 

As time length goes, 10 seconds is just enough to revive someone, which I think is perfect. Any shorter and they would be alot less effective in duos.",FortNiteBR

Is there a reason traps deploy *almost* instantly with no indication that they've been triggered?

I mean, I know this is Fortnite and the game revolves around weapons and traps that are way way too strong, but it seems a little silly to me that traps can insta-kill someone with 120hp with *almost* NO way for them to react or defend themselves once the trap has been triggered.

In my opinion traps should be changed in multiple ways. There should be an additional .15 or .20 second delay to react to the trap once you've triggered it. There have been so many times that I've triggered a trap and instantly noticed it but there's just no time to back out of the room. There should be an opportunity for players to react or use their game skill/knowledge to dodge the trap once triggered.

Also, the traps damage absolutely must be nerfed. One shotting players at 120hp? What are the devs thinking? Are there not enough things in the game that can one shot players with 100-120hp? Why do traps need to be on that list? Nerf trap damage to 95 and stop punishing players that have 100hp with pseudo-
permanent traps that are *almost* impossible to dodge if they catch you off guard. 

And before 200iq redditors respond and tell me to jump once I've triggered traps, obviously I'm talking about ceiling/wall traps. Although jumping to avoid floor traps is a funny joke. Almost impossible to pull off.",FortNiteBR

Building walls, ramps, using shooty guns that made loud noises and getting really excited for a gold SCAR or rocket launcher.

But no more.

No, my friends, I have seen the light, and it's a purple semi-auto Glock 19 with safety trigger, laser sight, a quick-release magazine, and a silencer that makes it more top-heavy than a 1950's pinup painted on the side of a bomber dropping God's own reckoning on Nazi munitions factories below.  I don't mind the Gold version; they're supposed to be better in every way, but Purp and I...  we have a relationship.

Because I've *changed*, man.  Running and jumping with a blue burst looking for targets used to be my jam, but now I just find a bush, or a low branched pine tree, or an abandoned base with its back to the storm, and I wait.  You might say I camp, but if you've ever gone hunting, *really* hunting, you know that it's a religious experience.  You're communing with nature like the druids of yore, worshipping the air, the birds, the trees, and waiting to murder the ever living fuck out of someone who thinks that blue tac over there is worth breaking cover for.

The poor fools.  They have *no idea* what they are facing.

When they build their walls, high and strong, they build them on the wrong side.  When they crouch to snipe some far away enemy, they do not hear my approach.  Do I shotgun them point blank like a goddamn plebeian?  Fuck no.  Two taps to the back of their head so that, even as the sweet embrace of death sucks their soul from their very lips, they have no fucking clue where they were shot from.  And lo, when the spectating camera shows them me, *right the fuck behind them*, they will know that I am a messenger sent to deliver them from this good world and unto He who shall judge them for their sinful snipery ways.

Forget not, fellow silenced pistoleers, that stealth and cunning are your allies now.  Gaze upon the myriad of tricksy trapsy videos that have come unto this sub of late, and take heart, for you are not alone.  Build the walls and traps you need.  And leave, trusting them to do their work whilst you bring cold repose to parts yet unexplored.

My friends have told me that it is no longer fun to play with me.  They charge ahead, and then act concerned that I linger in the shadows.  ""Buh the storm!"" they shout at me.  They should know I have it calculated to the second.  ""Res me I'm down!"" They holler into the air, not realizing they are my bait.

Fear not, teammates, I shall raise you in my image soon enough.  For as much as I may use methods unfamiliar to you, you will find that they are effective, and you will find that I am generous to my ~~lures~~ allies.  For I need only my single Purp and your unwanted small bullets, and in exchange you may have my SCAR, my Sniper, or my Rockets.  You take these shields, friend, for you are my meat shield, and I have no need for these ephemeral protections.  The bush is my protector.  The trees.  The water.  Not that brown weed thing that provides no cover at all though - fuck that thing.

And lo, with this pistol I have achieved greatness.  Two days ago I won my first solo match, and I took not a hit, for none knew where I was or whether it was mortal or spirit that claimed their flesh.  And last night I solo queue'd into squad mode and claimed the victory there as well, ending seven along the way, including five of the final twelve.

So if you see me in game, know that you are fortunate, because if I had found a delicious, vicious purple pistol, you would never have seen me at all.  And for my brothers in the shadows:  Happy Hunting.  May all your kills send you salty hate-chat, for they do not know that your cunning, and not your bullet, is what laid them down.

It's absolutely ridiculous that you are able to fire a round from a pump shotgun, switch to your other pump shotgun, fire a round, and then switch back to your original pump to fire yet another round. This allows two pumps to be treated as a tactical shotgun with 10 rounds but with a significantly higher damage output. My suggestion is that Epic changes this broken mechanic by making it so that when you fire a round from a pump shotgun and immediately switch to another weapon before chambering a new round, that weapon needs to go through the animation/sound of chambering a new round before it can be fired again. There is nothing more frustrating than having  two grey pumps fire two rounds in less time than it takes to fire two rounds out of a purple tactical. Absolutely ridiculous. ",FortNiteBR

Internally, our failures were caused by several factors:
 
* Staffing of Epic’s customer support hasn’t kept up with growth of the player base. We failed to anticipate and quickly react to growth.
 
* We didn’t properly communicate core values and our overall philosophy to the Customer Support team, leaving agents without clear guidance. This was compounded by us not having a great internal feedback loop to process issues.

* We used customer service as a fallback safety net instead of fixing or improving root causes. E.g. issues with account linking is something we need to improve on the development / UX side.
 
&amp;nbsp;   
We are in the process of addressing these issues with a goal of providing excellent player support on two fronts: 

* First response time in under 8 hours
* Positive and thoughtful resolutions on the first interaction  
&amp;nbsp;   
 
This will take time to accomplish but we are committed to delivering the level of service you deserve.  
&amp;nbsp;   
 
Please reach out if you were unhappy with a previous support ticket resolution and we will work to make it right! Also feel free to reach out to me at daniel.vogel@epicgames.com to make me aware of outliers and areas we need to improve. I can’t promise that I’m going to respond to all emails, but I will definitely read them all.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Thanks for playing!

It’s was my favorite game mode ever and with the new map layout everyone wont be so crowded in certain areas like before. Plus I feel like we’re getting to a point where people are starting to understand the game a lot better than before in terms of being team player and actually strategizing on what to do during team gun fights. I’ve noticed bases are getting better and squad mates are sharing items a lot more. 

I guess I just miss going around the map and helping out my other random 49 teammates in gun fights making sure they’re all healed up after and everyone was ok before I ran off to help the next group. It was something different than how I’d usually play. I was more of the Medic/Special Ops kind of player. Meaning I’d be either sneaky Sniper in the distance picking people off of I’d sneak around the enemy player and ambush from behind with smoke grenades and a silenced smg. But the best part was the small interactions you’d have with other players on your team. Sometimes they’d drop you weapons if you drop in an area too late, Sometimes there’d be little dance parties in the middle of Retail Row, or if a squad sees you’re all alone and then they adopt you as the 5th member of their squad and you watch each other backs until you find yours or vice versa and the guy your team is protecting runs off and finally finds their squad. 

Please Epic, bring back 50v50 limited time mode. It’ll work perfect with the new map POI’s and how the layout the the land is now. Everyone wont be crowded in either Pleasant Park or Greasy Grove and matches wont be so 1 sided anymore by depending on wether or not you land in an area of 20 other teammate.",FortNiteBR

So i heard of this thing where you can play with your console friends if they link their account to their pc account. My friend (ps4) linked his account and i then joined his party. 

How do i know we were on console servers?
1. I watched enemies build very very slow compared to what im used to and also turned around slowly or in a constant speed.
2. My ps4 buddies friends were able to join our party through his ps4 friends list.
3. Lot of bush hiders
4. Overall very different experience than pc. 

1 thing i noticed that console players have an advantage over me.... they always hit headshots with ars/scars.

I haven't enjoyed gaming this much since the release nearly MW2. This is just a list of ideas I have thought of or seen all in one place that could be used to make Fortnite even better than it is now! Not all of these changes are neccessary, however, it would be nice to have Epic see this list so they are aware of some of the things that might need changing in future patches. If I have not given people credit, I apologise, the list is too long for me to go find the OP's of some of these ideas. Also, if you do not like any of my suggestions, let me know why you think it would be a bad idea.

*  First off the spectate mode needs a serious overhaul. I understand that they don't want teammates to be massive helpers but seriously, there is no reason we should be forced to spectate with no HUD, no map, no crosshairs, no teammates names. One really annoying thing is not being able to see damage numbers coming off enemies in spectate mode. This needs to be updated so I can actually enjoy spectating. 

* Now that there is no more friendly fire in squads and duos, going into your inventory screen should also show you your team mates inventories.

* Be able to spectate your friends while they are in a game and you are in the lobby. I again understand that this may be not wanted due to the previous argument listed, but when I see a friend that is in a game with 10 alive, I want to watch and gee up so badly. - maybe have a 1-minute delay on the spectate? 

* You should be able to continue running whilst in the inventory. Controls for this should be the right-stick or d-pad. It would be much easier to make inventory changes on the go, especially when running from the storm.

* I think that bushes (item and map-bushes) are a good meta in the game; they offer the chance to win to almost anyone. They cater to people who enjoy the stealthy playstyle. That being said, it is far too difficult to see or notice whether someone is in a bush or not, I shouldn't have to shoot a bush to see if someone is in it. Ideally there would be something that would indicate that someone is in it; maybe make it shake/ shimmer every [designated time] or have a different colour, or feet just poking out the bottom very slightly. Also, after using the bush item, there should be some way to remove the bush. It seriously takes up half your screen and if someone is standing 5-10m in front of you in a close fight you legitimately cant see them.

* If your bandages stack over 15 when picking up some more, it should not drop your weapon, but rather pick up the exact amount to get to 15 for one stack. No one ever needs more than 15 bandages.

* Mini-shields, bandages and grenades should auto pick-up if you already have some in your inventory.

* When in spectator mode other teammates should have a glow around them that is visible through walls, eg. CS:GO. This one can maybe be skipped, as it is a bit gimmicky and takes some skill out of the game. I do think that it is fair enough just for the fact that when you're in your forts, sometimes its a clusterfuck trying to find which level people are on and what not.

* Console players should be able to bind their own controls. It's surely not too much time or effort to allow this to happen. As well as this, players should be able to switch the order of their building/ assign buttons eg. R1, R2, L1, L2. Also, at the moment there is a bit of delay on console after pressing the build button to being able to rotate through your build options. The delay is really slight, but when I am in a hectic close encounter fight and want to build, I know that I just have to press circle, R1, R1 to get my ramp. So I smash it really quickly but instead of taking me to my ramp, I will instead change a gun and only move one step across to the floor due to the delay. Please change this.

* Kill cams. Final kill cam at least. So many times I think I'm in the all clear and just get killed out of knowhere. It'd be nice to know how you died. 

* After you win the game, give 10 seconds of running around/ emote time to celebrate your win. It would be funny to see all the creative celebrations people would do after winning. Allowing building in this time would be cool too. I saw an idea to even pick an emote that will automatically play when you win. There should 
also be a ""podium"" shot almost of you and your squad doing a victory pose or whatever like in COD:WW2
* There should be some challenges or achievements which give you awards. Even if its as simple as a different colour umbrella for amount of wins. Green - 5, Red - 10, Blue - 20, Purple - 50, Gold - 100. [This post](https://i.redd.it/p6pyqohwema01.png) on the front page of this subreddit is a good idea for it. Maybe have a different texture for each of solos, duos and squads. I understand that this is a free game and we shouldn't ask for much when they already give us so much, But I do think wins should be more meaningful and have more use than just padding your stats. At the moment I have 34 wins over all my game modes. Winning now isn't the best feeling cause I don't really get much out of it and there is no goal for me to strive for. You should at least get a battle star for a win with a limit of 5 a day.

* Another post I saw recently was allowing us to build a tombstone by unselecting all of the squares in edit mode except for the bottom middle one. This would be fun for the disrespect to both team mates and enemies after their deaths.

* Add a leave as party option. If I am in duos and one of us dies early, sometimes we leave party to speed up the games. Leaving the game removes you from party, and then sometimes I accidentally ready up and get into a que for solos because I didn't realise I had left the party.


* I feel like explosives are too strong against players, especially in the end game. They are neccessary for the game since building is an option, my suggestions are to either add a blast shield type deal that gives special shield just for explosives, or just lower the actual area of the explosives deal damage to. The explosives are meant for breaking Forts. It's extremely sad to lose a game due to a guy just spamming RPG's at you.

* The end of the game stats should show a the line that you traveled over the map and highlight the kills along the way. Idea taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7r716g/suggestion_when_you_finish_a_match_die_or_win_the/)


Bugs

* The weapons not picking up glitch has been happening so much more recently. Not sure if something has changed but this needs to be fixed eventually. 

* I'm not sure if the sniper and shotgun glitches are real or not, but I have definitely had times with each which have made me think WTF after shooting through him. If this is a bug then it needs to be fixed.

* Recently I had a glitch that so far I have not been able to recreate. It is a bit difficult to explain so I will give it a go. I was in a fort and I was looking at another guy in a fort about 100m away. I was moving back and forth on my ramp to pop my head out and take cover. It was either my wall or his wall that was a bit broken, but when I moved back and forth passed my wall, I would see a split second shadow/silhouette of his full body through the wall. Made it really easy to snipe him.

* If you are switching to a bandage or shield and spamming R2 to use the item, sometimes a 'fake shot' comes from your gun. The gun sounds and feels like it just shot, giving away your position to enemies, but not actually firing the bullet.

* Sometimes, when building, your building rotates to try to fit the terrain and then  stays locked in that rotation. Can lead to annoying deaths. 





Additions

* I think the Fortnite combat system is seriously fucking fun. When I play, I often just jump to the most popular areas and run around killing as many people as I can, rather than actually trying to win. There should be some ways we can play this game without having to play a survival based game mode. I think that some form of either 1v1 duels, 2v2 or 4v4 duo and squad battles that take place in various POI's of the map. This could be similair to a counter strike search and destroy type mode, or even a straight out deathmatch. Some people argue ""this is a battle royale survival game, dont try to change it"". That argument is silly IMO. Why limit the enjoyment we can have with this great unique combat system and force us into one game mode. With 40 million players atm I think that there would be no issues with ""stealing"" some of the player base to these other game modes. If they were to create some of these game modes, it would ensure so much more longevity to the game. I'm not sure how long I will be able to continue just with the battle royale mode for a year or so.

* Similar to the last point, I think that the ability to create custom matches would be a very solid addition to this game. First off, there needs to be a sandbox/practice mode to practice building and to an extent shooting. It should just be a small portion of the loading island with some resources, guns and target dummies. Being able to create a private match with 1 mate just to test certain things out would be really beneficial, and it would also be fun as fuck to be able to 1v1 your friends.

* For limited time game modes, I think that a Snipers/pistols or snipers/shottys game mode would be an enjoyable addition. I saw a good idea of having it as a 'Wild West' type mode with only snipers, revolvers and pump shotties.


Edit:

More things on the list


* Duos on OCE all the time! Having duos only online from 4-11:30 is seriously shit. After 11:30 all of squads is just duos that cant play anymore cause the servers have shut. I get that Epic wouldn't want to restrict their players from playing with each other, but how often do you have 4 people who can play at the same time not during peak times? I think duos should always be available as it is much more competitive.

*  Although I love the new map so far, I feel like we might have just gotten too many POI's. I used to think that the east side had maybe 1 too many, but now the west side has probably more POI's than the east. I feel like it just spreads out the population base too thin for there to be exciting games from all of the players. An idea might be to have rotating POI's so they can make the most out of the POI and the models, but reduce the amount lf drop locations for players.


If there is anything you feel that I have missed or should be added, let me know and I will add them on.

Having a stronger SMG variant would help to alleviate some of the need of carrying a shotgun (or 2) and an AR at all times. SMGs are useful at close/mid range, and are good at destroying barriers and giving cover fire, something the pistol can't do so well with its small magazine.

**What would make this good?**

Shotguns have the edge on SMGs because they can hide behind cover between shots and do a lot of damage at once. SMGs require continuous line of sight to do well. Where they shine is DESTROYING cover and putting many bullets down range, doing continuous damage. A large magazine size, fast rate of fire, and manageable bloom are what make the SMG work well. This is also why I greatly prefer the SMG over the tactical SMG since it is better in every way except for damage. And the advantage the SMG has over the pistol is its large magazine.

**What would this look like?**

An Epic/Legendary FN P90 would do the job. With a 50 round magazine, I think this would be a useful weapon even if its damage wasn't all that great. It would be good as a barricade buster and suppressive fire gun. Or maybe just pair it with a pump shotgun, who knows.

_______________________________________________________________________

I know reddit doesn't usually like gameplay suggestions, so this thread probably won't see the light of day, but I just needed to get some of these thoughts off my chest. Feel free to do the same here.

**Off-Topic Suggestions:**

If it were up to me, I would add another AR to the game, a Scoped Burst Rifle. It'd only come in Epic and Legendary, and would just be a fusion of the scoped and burst rifles. In this case you'd reduce the rarity of the scoped AR from rare/epic to uncommon/rare. That way you get the whole rarity spectrum covered. Buffing ranged weapons might also help to deter people from being so reliant on shotgun pushing.

I think headshots should be brought down to 2x damage for all guns (except AR's, which were already nerfed). If every weapon headshot for 2x damage instead of 2.5x, it'd solve the issues I have with pumps, pistols, etc. Bolt snipers would still do over 200 on headshots, and pumps could only do up to 190 damage on a headshot instead of 237. I'm fine with double pumps if that's the case, since it does take up an inventory space, even though it doesn't make sense (never having to use the pump action). The speed of switching to fire could be reduced very slightly, that is all. 

For other guns, I would have the auto sniper do more damage (especially with headshots nerfed), reduce the accuracy of the rocket launcher, and increase the scoped AR accuracy. I'd also add sway if moving while scoped with the AR/sniper.",FortNiteBR

With that being said I do believe the pump shotguns ability to 1 shot headshot is a extremely strong. In my honest opinion, 175 would be great hs damage for the pump and if you really wanted to get crazy maybe a double barrel(regular barrel) with pump shotgun’s range and damge, make it gold, and let it keep the 1shot headshot. With or without the double barrel I do believe 1 shot to the head really allows players to get outplayed and yet still win the gunfight. Some might argue oh don’t make the game competitive, I would say even for casuals getting 1 pumped is not fun at all especially when you have the advantage and or got your opponent to a very low percentage. thanks for reading

edit: If I were to add on to the double shotgun maybe not one shot but have a fire rate where you can barely build inbetween the shot and one shot does 175, making it a double pump but with 2 shots and maybe then remove the ability to double pump. Also make building consistent so a wall does not get a tip of the top in certain areas &lt;3. Just sharing suggestions for fun love fortnite. ",FortNiteBR

They also talked about moving places between floor and stairs, this will not be done, cannot find source for this comment. (PSA: you can edit 
pyramid pregame lobby and use them as stairs)

**Clans**

* Alot of people have been waiting on this but the game is still in early access and there are alot of things to be done like bug fixes and QOL(Quality of life) updates before they will be working on it, but its on the drawing board *Cant find source 100% sure i saw it some place, take it with a grain of salt.*




**Spectator counter**

* Someone from epic commented on a post saying its already in the game and theyre debating on enabling it or not since it can cause more stress to certain players but a toggle button will not be very unlikely. No source here, use the search button this time :)





**Legendary shotguns and other weapons**

* The creative director also said in the youtube interview that they will be looking into new weapons as legendary shotguns and power weapons. The legendary shotguns would most likley have same stats as the epic or rare one but could have attatchments like laser sight and such
*New Melee weapon*
This one is a bit speculation, but they're talking about it.

Is it a branding issue? A money issue? A platform issue?

Fortnite Battle Royale is the one game that players of all platforms love and would benefit and revolutionize gaming if they were to allow cross compatibility at least amongst consoles (PC in there would be a little tricky with the whole aiming assist and all that on console).

I downloaded this game around a month ago because I heard it was free and it looked pretty fun. 26 hours and almost 300 games later I can't get a single win. I've placed top 10 over 20 times, final 2 around 5 times, top 25 around 60 times. At first I tried to survive but after getting smoked in fights against clearly better players near the end I took people advice and trained by diving ASAP into high traffic areas. 

I got the hang of building and reacting to getting shot at quickly by building. I typically hold my own in a head to head fight and I think I win over half the time when it comes to that. Still, 300 games later I still can't seem to get a win. This wouldn't bother me if I didn't look online at Epic forums and Reddit and see people saying that they win like 10% of their games, winning their first game after 50 tries, being all surprised at people not being able to win after 200 games and all that. 

I know technically you have a 1% chance to win but it still pisses me off because it feels like I must be missing something if everyone else here is winning consistently. I see people saying they get 5 kills per game but on average I have around 1 kill per game. This isn't because I'm pussing out and hiding from people. Every game I dive with everyone into town, some games I get flanked and die instantly, some games the guy picks up the weapon from the chest I open and I dont stand a chance, some games I survive the first 30 seconds and end up getting 5 kills and making it to top 25. I see conflicting advice online - ""Stop treating it like DM, its a survival game,"" while also seeing ""Stop being a bitch and jump into populated areas and kill people in the beginning.""

I dunno, I guess I'm just ranting at this point because its getting extremely frustrating. Maybe I'm not as good as I think I should be, but I feel like Ive taken a lot of advice I've seen online, trained in the areas I suck at, and applied that advice well.

Currently, I’ve been experimenting with mapping B button to upper left paddles and A to upper right paddle.  I’m slowly trying to incorporate LB and RB on to the lower paddles.  Problem right now is trying to get my muscle memory to stop relying on the actual B and shoulder buttons.  I think I might end up disabling those buttons all together so I force myself to use the paddles only. 

This set up makes a lot of sense to me.  It should give you a significant advantage in both building and combat by being able to switch to build mode and switch between different structures and different weapons quickly.  Using all those paddles does scare me, though.  I’m used to using strictly two in all other shooters.

I have my right stick sensitivity curve set to smooth, but am going to just move that to default.  Rather rely on changing in-game sensitivity setting/ rather than the global controller setting.

As of this day, this game has more weapons and consumables than ever, making the current, *not updated since release* inventory, feel rather shallow. 

Here is a list of every pickup in the game, excluding traps etc. that do not take up inventory spaces. Also, newly added pickups since early release will be in **bold**:

Pistol

Revolver

**Silenced Pistol**

SMG

TAC-SMG

**Silenced SMG**

M4 Rifle

Burst Rifle

Scar

Scoped Assault Rifle

Pump Shotgun

TAC-Shotgun

Semi-Auto Sniper

Bolt-Sniper

Grenade Launcher

Rocket Launcher

Bandages

Medkit

Shield Potion

**Small Shield Potion**

**Slurp Juice**

Grenades

**Smoke Grenades**

**Boogie Bomb**

**Bush**

This is a total of **7** additional items to pick up in the game.

I can't be the only one constantly having dilemmas about whether or not i should drop my golden silenced pistol or my 10 stacked smoke bombs for that Medkit. Or whether or not getting a grenade launcher is worth it over 9 Small Shield Potions or dropping 3 medkits. The list goes on.

My suggestion is to get individual slots for *Weapons* and *Consumables*, as well as giving *Grenades*, *Boogie Bombs* and *Smoke Grenades* their own unique spot. Just like traps/launchpads/bonfires are under the same spot, since they function alike (stick to walls/floors).

I thought it'd be cool to update it and make some changes to their board, and make a [physical version](https://imgur.com/HMVbtRz). 

[The Board](https://imgur.com/a/lNs1y) design is the same as u/Wheatleyart's, but the tiles are completely different. With 5 new maps, I only had to make up 4 location names based on real map locations. I also thought it would be fun to replace jail with the storm since it's the Fortnite equivalent to Monopoly jail.

My favorite part was making the [chance](https://imgur.com/gallery/YOgSv) ([digital](https://imgur.com/a/qxe1k))and [community chest](https://imgur.com/SxyCLgo) ([digital](https://imgur.com/gallery/eAomg)) cards.
I even made [deed cards](https://imgur.com/a/g3ACY) ([digital](https://imgur.com/a/JXsFb)) for the properties.

Just thought I'd share this with you guys just in case you wanted to make your own board. My suggestion would be to print on cardstock. I also split the board into [six pieces](https://imgur.com/a/JXsFb) so that you're able to print onto 8.5 X 11 paper. If anyone else uses this to make their own board I would love to see it!

Again, thanks to u/Wheatleyarts for the concept/design!

Like all of you, I spend 99% of my free time playing Fortnite, which I have a lot of now since I dropped out of college to pursue a career in delivering pizzas for the rest of my life. The other 1% I have not figured out a way to incorporate Fortnite into, although I’m sure the creators of r/OverwatchPorn are working on it as we speak! 

In my endeavors to survive more than 27 seconds after dropping Tilted Towers, I’ve slacked off on working out, as I’m sure most of you have as well. So I thought, “mafukin_steve_harvey, how could you combine Fortnite, and exercise into one?” About 2 minutes later, I came up a flawless and genius exercise plan, that will make you so huge your mom will never yell at you for screaming “fuck you nutcracker fuck!” at 3 AM ever again! It is as follows:

When you die you check how many people remain. You then proceed to do reps based on the remaining players. I like to use the formula, [Reps=2 x (10% of remaining players)]

Example:
You die with 65 people left. 13 push-ups and 13 sit ups. 10% of 65 is 6.5. 6.5 x 2 is 13.

If you get into the top 25 players, and die, [Reps= Kills x 3] 

If you get into the top 5 and die, or your team comes in second place, then you take your anger, and turn it into a solid 25 reps of each.

If you win, congratulations, celebrate by doing an easy 10 reps of each, but let’s be honest, that will not happen.

Obviously you can adjust these values to however you see fit, this is just what I personally do. Thank you for your time.

Any chance that Sony is shutting everything down to stop Epic from doing this?

I know this seems a little far fetched to hinder all of the PSN over this... but Fortnite does have 30 million unique users (kinda a big deal).

This could also explain the minor problems that the PC and Xbox crowd are having since they're losing some of us console shooting dummies.

I’ve been playing Fortnite on consoles for a few months now, and I feel as if each update they apply to the game, it introduces new problems. I’d like to think that these problems aren’t caused by my internet connection, as it is pretty good. I’d also like to consider myself an above average player, so it’s not because I’m “bad at the game.” Some of the problems I’ve been running into include: 

1. Severe input lag when it comes to building and picking up/changing through items and weapons, as well as inputs not being recognized. For example, I am on Xbox One, and I will quickly press the B button to enter build mode, then press RB twice to select stairs, only to find out I have floors selected. This gets me into trouble constantly during panic building situations. 

2. Rendering issues, especially after landing in the beginning of games. Edit: Haven’t had one rendering issue for months until the most recent update, in which I have had three instances so far. 

3. Game will want to stick and freeze for a couple seconds in combat situations. 

4. Getting shot through recently built structures (they claimed to have fixed this, but I swear it’s still happening). 

5. Inconsistencies with tactical shotguns. At this point, I would rather use a grey AR in close combat situations than a green tactical shotgun. I’m tired of getting terrible rolls, even though I am not missing my shots, and even getting headshots. Pump shotguns can be this way, as well. I feel as if 75% of the reason I die is because of my shotgun failing me. 

In my opinion, these issues make the game nearly unplayable to me. It seems as if the developers aren’t prioritizing these issues, and it’s extremely frustrating. I love this game, and I worked very hard to get to the point where I am now, skill-wise. I feel as if I’m not able to play at my full potential. I want to play more but am deterred by these issues that I experience almost every single game. Anybody else feel the same way? Anybody disagree? ",FortNiteBR

I'm a casual Fortnite player (lvl 32, tier 16, about19 hours in) who's had the game for about a month. I think it would be a little underwhelming if I, and everyone else who plays only a few hours a week, were able to unlock the black knight skin. It should be reserved for the players who play every day and are actually good. It's something that's supposed to be intimidating and show your dedication and skill. Even if 10% of players could earn it, I think that would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I think the skin is awesome and would love to have it. But if playing 20 hours a month was good enough, I wouldn't really care about it to be honest. Under the current BP structure it's only for the elite players and it should stay that way for the next season. Thoughts?

Edit: I'm not saying the current BP structure is perfect. I think it should be more skill based and rely less on grinding the challenges. But that again goes to only the best players getting the best skins/rewards. ",FortNiteBR

Second for late game scenarios it could help you determine whether or not you need to worry about some solo guy flanking you while you think your fighting a full squad camped up in some mega fort. For example if you're a team of 3 with 7 left you don't know if it's one whole squad or a few small squads or even 4 solo guys. But with a team counter if it said 2 you'd know it's 3v4, or if it said 3 or more you'd know to watch multiple angles. Just a thought I had. Love the game!!!!

I know a lot of us watch different Fortnite Streamers/YouTubers from Ceez to Ali-A. RhinoCrunch recently uploaded a video shaming streamers specifically Dakatoz, and spreading a fair amount of toxicity with one of the very few friendly gaming communities out there. 


Curious if anyone cares, or thinks there's anything we can/should do to try and calm down this negativity. It's nice being in a place where for the most part everyone gets along good enough.

lvl 2 will cost 50 v-bucks and lvl 3 will cost 150 v-bucks.
You must have lvl 2 to buy lvl 3.

Get it as a reward in the seasonal rewards.

Not as dependent on accuracy. If you miss a shot you get the other pump and try again. *This is the main problem.*

The trouble is there could be 12 people playing solo in a squad match, meaning that you'd have to get probably under 20 players left to be credited 1 game towards the 5 you have to do (because those solo players are each counted as 1 ""team"" right?). 

Also I'm aware that you can roll the dice and replace a quest but I've had it happen when I re-roll the quest and am given ""place top 6 in squads"". 

I don't know what I'm asking for here because I'm not saying they should be removed or anything*, and I see the point of them because it encourages people to play the other modes.. I just don't want to be forced into having to slog out a session on squads. Much rather just play my enjoyable solo games and complete the challenges naturally as I'm playing.

*perhaps the challenge could be altered so that it's more set in stone how many players you have to outlive? As opposed to how it is now where it's like you have to cross your fingers when you die and hope that where you placed = top 12.

• Faster than a tactical shotgun

• more damage, less bullet spread

• catches opponents off guard

• basically 10 ammo before reloading, vs 8 on a tactical or 5 on 1 pump

• Pretty hard to master (by this I mean get the rhythm down AND aim decently)

• input lag on console

• takes up an extra spot in place of something like a sniper or rocket launcher

- Increase materials needed to build stuff since you can farm so much wood from trees

I have experienced this in the last 6 of my 1v1's (half the time I had the high ground with rockets and the other half I was being molested by rocket spam).  It is impossible to be aggressive and build up since a gold rpg with 40+ rockets will immediately take down any sort of staircase/structure you build to attempt to get up to their base.  I really think epic should tweak rockets and maybe put a cap on the amount you can carry since it really isn't fun to be the person rocket spamming and it isn't fun to be on the receiving end.  ,FortNiteBR

BUT what if the boats were able to be ridden.
Each of the boats in the water with the chests on could be ridden around, but also have 1 extra boat at the bottom of the house, as an escape for 1 or 2 people.

I feel like if the boats had a bit of pace, but could be shot at and broken easily, Loot Lake could be a much more fun, niche landing place if everyone was racing for the paddle boats to make an escape.

EDIT: Just imagine you're coming in to land on the roof of the loot lake, but some other kid swoops down next to you and starts beating your ass with his axe. You break your way through and sprint to the chest, but make the terrible mistake of opening it first. The guy next to you sweeps it all up, and you're already legging it out of there. He's on your tail right up until you take a quick turn and drop down into the getaway boat below. He's looking around amongst the campfire and trees outside, losing precious seconds -- until he spots you in out in the water paddling away. He sprays everything in his clip at you, to no avail. You then proceed to turn around and dab on that MF as you sail into the moonlight cause all he got in the chest was an SMG, bandages and a nade.

2. No, the double pump is not broken because you can immediately shoot any weapon after switching weapons and is an “as-designed” game mechanic.

3. Yes, the double pump is broken because it doesn't take that much skill to deal a lot of damage quickly in close range (campy) situations.

4. No, the double pump is not broken because it takes a skilled player to use the double pump correctly and to know when to use it.

5. Yes, the double pump is broken because it gives an unfair advantage to equally skilled players where one is using double pump and one is not.

6. No, the double pump is not broken because it is a choice to grab two Pump Shotguns  and that takes up another slot that could be used for something else giving the double pump user a potential disadvantage in a different situation.

7. Regardless of whether the double pump is broken or not, I want it patched out because I hate getting double pumped.

465,Karl_SkidMarx,1516652886,7s8pda,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7s8pda/epic_can_you_issue_warnings_before_a_permanent/,5,Epic - Can You Issue Warnings Before a Permanent Ban for an Offensive Name? Your Rules are Ambiguous.,"My account was banned 2 weeks ago without warning or explanation. I finally received a  response from Epic today. Here is a transcript of the response I received:

&gt;Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.
Your Epic Games Display Name was reported to us as being inappropriate. **Due to the particularly egregious nature of your name, your account has been permanently banned.**
Any External Accounts linked to the now banned Epic Account will not be removed. This means you will not be able to link your External Account with any other Epic Accounts.


Now I understand certain names are egregiously inappropriate and accounts with such names should be banned. However, I think these types of bans without warning should apply only to names which are in clear, unambiguous violation of the rules epic has made for name creation. The rules regarding account naming are as follows:

&gt;Your display name must not contain any of the following:
(1) Vulgarity, hate speech, offensive or derogatory language of any kind
(2) Direct references to any Epic Games' employee, product, service, or character


Names endorsing genocide or racial epithets or offensive language are in clear violation of these rules. My account name was xX_JosephStalin_Xx. This name has a dull edge. It is not in the same league as things such as X_HItlerDidMNothingWrong_Xx or other such nonsense. My aim in naming my account was to appear as an AOL instant message account belonging to Joseph Stalin. I understand Stalin is a controversial figure but I don't see his name as unambiguously offensive as figures such as Hitler - who are directly tied to racially motivated genocide, which can fall under the hate speech rule. What hate speech or offensive or derogatory language is committed simply by the name Joseph Stalin? Would the same reasoning be used to ban names of other controversial historical figures such as Alexander the Great, Augustus Caesar, Napoleon or Genghis Khan? Each of these people conquered, subjugated and brutalized countless people. 

Again, I would have understood if Epic had sent me a warning email stating that some people had taken offense to my name. I would have gladly changed it if such a warning was given. Personally, I think the number of people truly offended by seeing the name, and only the name, Joseph Stalin are an extreme minority. I suspect the person that reported my name was not so offended by the name but just found a possible avenue to exploit ambiguous rules to ban his killer. However, as I said earlier I would have gladly changed my name if given a warning as I don't think my name was in clear, unambiguous violation of the rules laid out by epic. 

I had spent real money on my prior account because I enjoy the game and saw the communication between the playerbase and the developers on this subreddit and elsewhere as a positive. However, I won't make such purchases in the future in fear of being struck by the ban hammer because I was in violation of rules with an ambiguous interpretation. Would Karl_SkidMarx be banned for the same reason as xX_JosephStalin_Xx? 

**TLDR** If you find the name xX_JosephStalin_Xx egregiously offensive then history books must terrify you. Also, in ambiguous cases I think a warning prior to banning would be prudent. ",FortNiteBR

When i started playing fortnite, i was so scared to go aggro and i generally just bunkered down in a house for most of the game or hid in bushes. I ended up getting wins just by hiding and being a vulture towards the last bit of people. After getting some wins by camping i felt i needed to change up my game. I would win with 1-4 kills. I would watch youtubers and streamers to note what they did. I was so confused how they would win with 10-15 kills. So after watching alot of videos and changing up my play style, i wanna help out with some tips. 

1. You have to drop down in a crowded area! Its gunna suck guys, i know. I died so many times within the first 2 min by dropping in pleasant park and retail row. You have to get used to being in stressful situations and eventually you will find more solutions to in game problems.

2. Mess with ur aiming sensitivity because it took me a while to find a good setting.  You should be able to jump up and make a full 360. It helps for aiming fast at someone shooting at you and helps build walls faster around you.

3. BECOME BOB THE BUILDER! This is one of, if not, the most important tip i can think of. When i first started playing i treated this game like any other third person shooter. The second i got shot by someone or spotted someone i would just light em up like a Christmas tree. It was 50/50 that id die or live. Most of the time they would kill me because they would bunker down by quickly building a ramp and walls around em. The second u get shot u gotta build walls and ramps QUICK! When i get shot and the enemy is far i will build a ramp and walls, the standard little fort. If someone gets the jump on me and is shooting at me while being very close, i will spam walls and ramps in different directions. This will CONFUSE THE HELL OUTTA MOST PLAYERS. They wont know which ramp u will be one or which wall ur behind. Also, remember that you can build doors through the walls u built and catch players off guard if they try rushing your mess of a building. 

4. When your roaming around the map you needa be jumping non stop to make it harder for snipers and creepers behind you. When your jumping up and down look around! It helps to have higher sensitivity here because when ur roaming around u can jump and turn and scope out all around you. I cant tell u how many times i’ve down this and have caught creepers tryna get closer for a easier kill. 

5. ALWAYS BE STOCKED UP ON MATERIALS. I wont be running around the map without 500-600 wood and i usually just get brick/metal from kills. Wood builds up faster and has higher hp when u build it. You dont wanna be in an open field relying on trees or some form of cover. 

6. When it gets to the last 15 or so it helps to come into the areas by following the storm. Theres a smaller chance of someone being behind you. 

7. When you loot..BUILD WALLS AND RAMPS AROUND IT! You are not the only loot troll! There is usually always someone who runs to the sound of shots to pick people off. Never pick up loot without building. 
 
Thats all i can think of for now but if i think of other stuff ill edit it in. Hope this helps everyone! ",FortNiteBR

When using the Pump Shotgun, the player can shoot one shot and then the shotgun must be “pumped” before another shot can be taken. This “pump” action slows down the fire rate of the Pump Shotgun dramatically and is the main drawback to using the Pump Shotgun. 

**Step-By-Step How to Double Pump**

•	The player has two Pump Shotguns on their hotbar

•	The player shoots Pump Shotgun 1

•	Just as Pump Shotgun 1 is about to be “pumped” the player swaps to Pump Shotgun 2

•	Pump Shotgun 2 can be fired immediately, so the player shoots again right away

•	Just as Pump Shotgun 2 is about to be “pumped” the player swaps back to Pump Shotgun 1

This method eliminates the “pumping” of the Pump Shotgun and dramatically reduces the time between shots for the Pump Shotgun practically eliminating the one downside of the Pump Shotgun.

**Draw Backs**

The person performing the Double Pumping suffers only one drawback: they need to have a Pump Shotgun in two inventory slots instead of one. This is a big deal, but there some reasons this isn’t as bad as some people make it sound. I encounter Double Pumping the most during the early phase of a game. Nobody has anything too valuable to hang on to and gray Pump Shotguns are on the ground EVERYWHERE. It is not too much of a sacrifice to give up early game inventory slots for the amazing gains Double Pumping grants the player. Shotgun fights happen very often late game as well and some players have opted to carry a 2nd Pump Shotgun in place of Splode/Sniper/Extra Healing in order to use Double Pumping in late-game shotgun fights.

**Why this is an Exploit and should be Removed**

It is very clear that the Pump Shotgun is meant to have a slow fire rate and high damage while the Tactical Shotgun is meant to have a higher fire rate with lower damage. Double Pumping removes the slow fire rate part of the Pump Shotgun. Weapon swapping is being used to alter the fire rate of a weapon that is intentionally meant to have a slow fire rate. Side Note: this same tactic can be applied to the revolver, but is a less noticeable change since we do not “pump” the revolver (it just has a slow fire rate).

**Suggested Fix**

If Pump Shotgun 1 is fired and Pump Shotgun 2 is pulled out without “pumping” Pump Shotgun 1, then the player MUST “pump” Pump Shotgun 1 when they switch back to it. This leaves the Double Pumping in tact for ONE weapon switch, but it cannot be done for the 5 bullet clip of both Pump Shotguns this way.

So I have been playing this game for a while and really like it, I tend to buy some in-game currency to help the company that made the game. 

The day before new year I was robbed if my cards and since one of those cards where saved as a billing option in fortnite. I accidentally used it too try to buy some v-bucks and because of that  my account is blocked from making any purchase, even from another bank.

Now the support have closed the ticket and won't respond, how can this be a good practise? 

I get robbed and now I get punished for that by being blocked from supporting a good game.


It would be nice to get a proper response from epic instead of half measured responses.

This is probably the most ridiculous thing if experienced with any customer support.",FortNiteBR

Of course the BR mode is still great, but having a mode that I can go to every couple games just to actually kill people in the same area would be fun.  A mode like this would have to be limited to any of the POIs, but I feel like Tilted Towers is almost an entire map of its own as it is.

A few points of how it would work:

- Everyone spawns with either a pistol or a burst rifle

- Weapons and chests spawn over the map like normal

- All walls have a little more health (maybe 2x) so the entire map is not destroyed in the first two minutes

- Goes for 5-10 minutes and first squad to get to 25 total kills wins

- 5 squads on the map (10 for Duos and 20 people for Solos)

- If all POIs are included in the mode, it could just be a standard rotation

- A storm would mark the boarders of the map

I hope more people feel the same way I do. It would be a much easier way to get better at the game.",FortNiteBR

However, this subreddit has a large problem with people mass downvoting comments (and even posts) that aren't particularly rude or mean, but instead are false (generally by someone that doesn't know better) or hold a dissenting opinion

The most egregious example I've seen (as a casual subreddit watcher) is this comment by u/pacificfroggie, where he starts off by qualifying his statement (""Correct me if I'm wrong...""). **Don't brigade his thread or the post as a whole.** https://np.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7s029w/15k_matches_played_in_be_this_has_to_be_the_most/dt14wuq?context=1 . There was no reason for him to be downvoted, since he was in fact corrected in his replies. Since there was a confirmation that his notion was wrong, his comment **added to the conversation and topic as a whole**.

Also, people tend to get trigger happy for people who hold an opinion that is even remotely contentious. This is evidenced by this comment by u/fossil_dan on the vertical audio request thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7ryh7e/the_lack_of_vertical_audio_is_making_tilted/dt0n5nk . He wasn't being rude, he wasn't insulting anyone, he was just expressing his opinion.

If you haven't heard of it before or are new to reddit, there's a set of unspoken, relatively unenforcable rules that redditors should follow known as redditquette ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ).

Edit for clarification:
-Footstep audio range has been greatly reduced, not giving you much time to react and easily losing players past 5-10 ft. range when tracking footsteps. 
-Crouch walking/running is loud and does not give much incentive to play stealthy as players can still hear you clearly when crouch walking/running. 
-difficult to gauge how much noise you're actually making when moving. I sound quiet through my headset but apparently am stomping around like an elephant to other players...even when crouch walking. 
-when crouch walking/running, your own footsteps continue playing after you have stopped moving
-footsteps sound like they are coming from a couple feet behind you

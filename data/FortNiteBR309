I hope I'm not the only one sharing this opinion.

I really love this game, from the concept itself to the art and almost all gameplay elements make it genuinely fun. Its a great and fun version of the Battle Royale GameMode.

For quite sometime that this has been bugging me, 

Please... remove Bloom. Its starting to get infuriating not being able to develop skill in such a fun game, you either build and shotty someone, or have to rely entirely on a random value that determines if you hit your shot or not... 

I understand that its of the most importance to keep the game balanced and enjoyable for everyone, and things like bloom give low-skilled players a chance in some way, but please think about us, the players that give hours and hours who want to be able to compete with each other based on skill and not luck.

Everyone knows how to build now, its such a core gameplay mechanic, please Epic, don't nerf it, you're taking away one of the elements that make your game so unique, different gameplay elements.

Just remove Bloom, or substantially nerf/reduce it. Let us have fair firefights where we should worry about aim positioning and damage output on our weapon, not some random value that makes our weapon either godlike or complete garbage.

I'm not saying that recoil should not exist, but this obnoxious 'sway' or bloom that its completely random, it isn't fun... having your aim on someone for 2 mags straight and being able to only hit the minority of the shots.

The scoped AR and the sniper are really fun because of the absence of such thing, or at least, not such a noticeable presence, the scoped AR especially is really really really fun to use.

Once again, I really appreciate your game, I'm a STW Founder and have invest many hours into your game.

As a competitive player, I really want to be able to control my gameplay, and die without a problem, knowing I was outskilled/outshot by someone, and not that his bloom was in a good mood and mine wasn't.

Looking forward to see all the future content, your stance regarding everything else is amazing, cosmetics, lore, updates and overall feedback, Fortnite as a whole is such an amazing experience, so thank you for this brilliant game.

Its just starting to get annoying all these huge-small factors that make all the difference regarding gameplay, I know myself and I know that if it keeps this way I'll eventually get tired of FortniteBR and no longer enjoy it, along with a significant chunk of the community that wants to be competitive and play against skill and not luck.

Thanks

Love you guys.

But maybe with a LTM like this once in awhile, good players can experience better combat engagements having everybody start with the same loadout. I think this would be an excellent idea and obviously some other benefits to it also for it being an LTM like higher AR spawns and maybe have zero explosives in it altogether. My main idea is the Pistol and Bandages spawn, to encourage smarter, more tactical combat engagements. No RPGs would just be a bonus with the LTM since we've never had a LTM void of explosives yet.

As most of you probably know, this has little to no effect on fights as jumping shotguns is and always will be the way CQC is fought in this game. The only jump fatigue actually comes into play is during build battles, where it can really fuck you over if you get it at a bad time, either when battling for high ground or trying to prevent someone for retaking the high ground. I think we can all agree that jump fatigue has done nothing to stop people from jumping and shooting and it would be better to just remove it altogether.

On the other hand, I’m seeing more and more people exposing the “Tfue” crouch spam peek where it’s virtually impossible to hit you as only the bare top of your head ever ends up above whatever wall you are peeking. The easiest way to combat this is by adding a crouch fatigue, similar to the mechanic CS:GO. Unlike jumping, you’re never really going to be spamming crouch for 5-10 seconds at a time unless you’re doing this peek so it wouldn’t really affect the game in other areas. The fatigue should only come if you are consistently spamming crouch, and not waiting a second or two between each peek.

Its kind of sad for me that i just realised honestly how far off i am of max omega. At level 60, you’re only about halfway to max omega. Nows thats just demotivating for the players. I get bored of this game quite easily, without any new update content, so i generally stick to LTMs such as 50v50 and sniper shootout. Though, i have burned through multiple hours of grinding each and every day, hoping that it pays off by reaching the final, max omega skin. I am sitting at a mere level 63, which is only slightly past halfway. There is no way i am gonna be able to play as much as i did in the last 6-7 weeks in just a couple of weeks, since i honestly play the game 2+ hours on weekdays and like 4 on weekends. That is just absurd to me how insanely difficult and grindy it is to reach max omega. Of course, this will control the number of max omegas in this game, however i think i, and a majority of the playerbase have burned through too much time to just not get the “finishing product”. I mean, imagine if your at level 78. grinding 13 levels past max carbide and still havent gotten a single thing in return. looking back, i unlocked the second last piece of carbide like 5 weeks ago, and i still havent maxed it yet. thats just sad.

Please, make it easier for us to reach max omega.

I can't think of another game where a headshot with a shotgun did not mean instant death and I can't think of a game where people complained about headshots resulting in instant death so why are we complaining here. Because a lot of the people complaining are young children who hasn't had as much gaming experience as some older people, often when someone complains about something that they want changing they don't often consider the consequence and a lot of the times these consequences make the situation worse.

What also happened recently is the building nerf which, as far as I'm aware, was uncalled for. They brought back blitz after high demand but v2 was terrible and the reason behind that is that we did not get as many building battles as we had the last time round because we are more limited on the amount of materials we have. The building nerf meant that we have to spend more time farming and less time running looking for people to kill which nobody hear wants to do.

I get that epic games is trying to attract new players and is trying make as many people happy, but that shouldn't make epic games change things just because some people complained about the shotgun. Epic should listen to the people who play this game but should've evaluated the benefits and consequences and make the decision that shows more benefits. 

I feel that the game was at its best just before the building nerf. But the building nerf and shotgun nerf really just killed the game for me. Obviously it could've been better but it's gone downhill from there.

With some improvements nights could add a whole new layer of fear and strategy to the game.

#Sounds
First off, they should be way darker. Whenever its night you barely realize because you can still see absolutely everything. Hardly anything changes and it's a missed opportunity. If they were made darker and houses and lamp poles had lights, this would add both a new look, and something most br's dont have. 

#Enviorment
Secondly, they should have noise. In a world such as fortnite's, theres hardly any noise during day, let alone at night when there should be crickets all around and frogs near water. Owl sounds and anything such as these could improve the environment quite a bit.

#Items
Third, a new rare item should be added if these things are taken into account and made a reality. A recon backpack, like the jetpack, that takes up inventory space. This would include night vision goggles, and when you select the backpack in your inventory you pull out a Parabolic Microphone. Pressing your keybind for shooting will focus your hearing in that direction and amplify it until you release the button. 

For balance, night vision should be fuzzy and much lower quality than the games resolution itself. If some visual static is added, it will be harder to spot players. The item is rare aswell so it wouldnt be too difficult to find.

99&amp;#37; of the times I end up taking the high ground. And 80&amp;#37; of those times I die because he either just looks up instead of trying to take the high ground and one pumps me somehow OR I just can't get an angle to shoot him from. You'd think after all these matches my aim would be really good until I realized yesterday, I didn't turn off the ""enhance mouse pointer"" option in windows, which is basically Mouse Acceleration. I'm getting worse and worse, and choking more and more shots as days go by. Getting more and more depressed. I'm playing with the mindset that I just wanna get better at this game no matter what(and maybe that's where I'm wrong) I've gotta be doing something wrong. Why am I still playing like a noob after all these matches. My building is pretty fast but I just can't get a clear shot at him. I pull out my AR and guess what, I can't hit AAaanything cause all the shots are going behind his back and bloom isn't helping either. I try tapping with AR but rarely one of the bullet will hit. ARs are supposed to be hitscan but they take time to travel which is exactly what's cucking me up.

What's the point of winning build fights when you can't hit him?!!? Only players I can kill are bots who don't build at all. But even they end up killing me somehow (even when I have the high ground).

What bothers me is that I'm a pretty decent player but I can't do anything properly in this game.

I'm just looking for some general tips to improve in this game. Should I just keep playing more until I get good? As much as I'd love to uninstall Fortnite, I can't. I've been playing for months and learned a lot.

The omega is a super buff, armored guy with lots of texture and the omen looks like a skinny guy in his pajamas with barely any texture, I feel like they should’ve done more texturing on the omen than what they did. Have him be more buff or whatever. I was super hyped about the skin but after buying him I realized the only rewarding factor is the battle-shroud backbling. Anyway it’s kind of too late to change the skin. I’m not going to be another one of those annoying people on this subreddit that just beg for adjustments to already released items. I just noticed that comparing the Omen to the omega showed me why it looks so disproportionate and skinny. It’s still a cool skin but it could’ve been done better. The more detailed skins with more texture are often the better looking skins in my opinion. That’s all.

Don't get me wrong, I like goofing around with the shopping carts and stuff like that. But the problem for me is the big building fights. That is just the most boring gameplay there is.

It's not that I can't build, I have been playing alot since BR came out. I have always been able to out build most people but I never enjoyed it back then. Luckily I didn't have to do a lot of building fights because most people couldn't build that good.

Now people have been better and can now build pretty good. This means that every fight I get into with a decent player means that I have to build my ass of. 

Most of the times, when I can't kill the guy quickly and we start a building fight, I just drop down to the bottom and just start dancing until he is comming down. 

I don't really know how to end this. U just wanted to get this out of me because I hate that my favorite game has become boring for me just because everyone is building.

I guess I'll end with a way to fix this somewhat. I like the materials nerf but you should nerf the max amount of mats as well.

Please let me know what you guys think.

TLDR: People are better so that means a lot more building. I'm getting bored because of all the building fights.

So here are some suggestions for what I believe should give xp that currently don't.

Kills pass the first kill.

Reviving downed teammates/squadmates (Excluding reviving downed players who eliminated them self as to prevent xp farming.)

Chests opened.

Squad wiping. (Being credited for each kill of an entire squad.)

Final Kill in 50's and 20's.

Accuracy above a certain threshold 60% or so.

Epic, please stop going in this direction.","I have been thinking about this ever since the pump had been nerfed, and it just bothered me so much because pumps were a very reliable close range weapon and Epic games had to nerf it to the point where it just didn't deal enough damage. I'm sure a lot of people wanted the pump nerf but it rewards good players who have good macro mechanics, it took skill to use. Personally, i don't think it should take more than 3 shots to kill someone with pumps with the occasional one-pump when someone has 100/50 health/shield, instead keep one-pumping in the game and just leave it alone. 

Another thing, building, is a core mechanic of the game and it seems like Epic wants to stray from build battles to allow newer players get into the game a lot easier by making it harder to get materials (I personally believe that building is one of the only things that takes skill, aside from sniping). For example, the Llama nerf, 500 mats to 200 is very extreme and building to survive is a part of this game and has been when going against a rocket launcher or grenade launcher. Sure, this is a good business strategy to appeal to newer people who don't know how to build, but they are hurting the players that have invested time into the game to learn these build mechanics and have mastered it. Less materials is not the answer to let new players into the game. Instead, make a training mode (Yes, i know playground is coming) or make a tutorial. They should learn to master the build mechanics as many other players have and have them try to improve instead of being eased into the game

Other than these two things, I personally believe everything is fine but seriously I don't want Epic to kill their own game by making these stupid changes. ",FortNiteBR

But there are a couple of things that really bog it down for me.

The first is the weapons meta:I don't like how instead of scrambling for any weapon you can find, its more like land and pray to the lord that you find a shotgun, cause you will likely die if you don't find one within 20 seconds.

The SMG and the pistol don't come even remotely close to the same level as the shotty, because the shotgun is consistent while the SMG and pistol are random. In fact every single weapon in this game is completely luck based with the exception of the Shotgun, the Revolver/Magnum and the Scoped AR and the bolt action sniper.

So right now the ideal loadout meta is 2 Pump shotguns, a Hunting Rifle or a Bolt action, and a scar for dealing with buildings or picking off low health targets and some small shield potions. You might switch the rifle for a rocket or grenade launcher, but those are so rare that you can play 15 games before you get your hands on one. 

Basically I'm annoyed that there are so many different weapons and loadouts....and yet there is only one good loadout with most others either being unreliable or straight bad. And all this is due to how random bullet spread on every other weapon is. Call me bad, say i suck at aiming. But even pro players admit that the shotgun is so dominant because most other weapons are just unreliable.  


My other complain has less to do with a bad game design and more what something will let people get away with. The building mechanic. The building mechanic is a great idea on paper make your own cover. The problem with this is that it lets the player building throw caution out the window, allowing people to be so much more reckless then they would have been without it or having building under a much more limited spectrum. 

Basically the building mechanic and more specifically the ramp allows people to play really stupidly and get away with it. This is why i agree with epic toning down how much materials you can actually get. But it's also the reason why this game burnt me out within the span of a month.

There's really only one way to actually win at this game, it feels like everyone (or at least anyone that makes it close to the end) has the same loadout. Unless it's early on, You're never killed by an AR, you're never killed by a mini gun, it's either you die to a shotgun to the face or a sniper bullet to the back of the head.

TL;DR: To put it simply I'm irritated at the lack of Actual variety in terms of viable weapons, and I don't like how building encourages people to play like idiots.

I play this game everyday, and I enjoy it very much, but the game is going to die if epic doesn't stop what they are doing. One last thing, this post was heavily inspired by the YouTube video ""why fortnite is dying"" by Ged.

      Epic games is lowering the skill gap so that new players don't feel so lost and underpowered. 
This is a big issue. Think about it. Most of fortnite is luck. Shooting? Bloom. (Except for shotguns, which they're nerfing). Weapons on the ground? Luck. One of the only things that isn't luck in this game is building. It takes skill. Now with the new changes, it seems like epic doesn't want you to build. They heavily reduced the blitz LMT resources. It seems like lowering the skill gap is something they want to do very much, just not by changing the core.

    The point here is that epic wants to lower the skill gap. In order to do this, they're making it harder to get materials to build, and also nerfing shotguns. If epic wants to change the shotgun meta, they need to make most of the guns consistent. Bloom shouldn't be in the game anymore. If every weapon was as consistent as a shotgun, then people would less likely want to shotgun fight most of the time.

    I know even shotguns aren't very consistent, but they are one of the most if not the most consistent weapon in the game. That's why people use a shotgun the most most of the time. If you look at most streamers, The majority of their kills come from shotguns.

   (TL;DR) Epic, you need to fix bloom and weapon mechanics overall. you don't need to lower the skill gap like you're doing by nerfing shotguns and materials.

But how can this game be fun if you’re running out of materials in the middle of a fight? When you’re out, you’re dead, that’s it, back to the lobby, rinse and repeat. 

Blitz is by far the best LTM,  you get decent materials, and the storm is MUCH faster. But that LTM comes once in a blue moon. 

If you’re gonna cater to new players, then leave normal mode as it is and then have a Ranked Mode for other players who want to play a bit more serious, just like you had in Gears of War 3. 

Just please buff the fucking materials, I want to have fun again in this game.

I’d assume it was better to require line of sight to build for logical reasons... being able to cut someone off despite being caught off guard shouldn’t be a thing.

Another example is you having the ability to place a ramp/floor on the other side of an opponent’s ramp once they ramp over you do stop them moving up. This just seems so stupid to me and I don’t know whether or not it’s intended or not.

If we compare a blue m14 to a gold scar, the scar does 3 more damage a shot. The scar has the same properties as the m14 aside from this, so the only real difference is a slight damage boost. From a balance standpoint, this is a reasonable difference in effectiveness between a blue weapon and a gold one of the same type. The difference is certainly not negligible, but it is not so large that someone who has a blue tier of a weapon is at a serious disadvantage when facing someone who has the gold tier. This isn't just true when comparing a blue rifle to a gold one; however, it's true of all the rarities within every weapon type in the game. A green tactical SMG to a purple, a blue sniper to a gold, a gray pistol to a blue: the difference is just damage points. The reason this is the case is so that weapon rarities have an effect on the game, but not an effect that causes them to play too large of a part in deciding the winner of a fight.

Enter the heavy shotgun. The heavy shotgun equips much faster, has a tighter spread, deals between 13 - 32 more max headshot damage (depending on tier), and shoots faster than the pump. It doesn't simply deal more damage; it does everything far better than the pump does, from damage to range to even equip speed. The only exception is that the pump deals slightly more bodyshot damage, but that means little when the heavy does significantly more headshot damage. The tighter spread also means that you can deal high damage from a much further range than the pump can anyway. And then there's double heavy shotgun. Double heavy shotgun is a monstrosity; it shoots even faster than a single tactical shotgun does and deals tons more DPS than double pump. Once someone is running double heavy shotgun, it's inarguable that you are at a serious disadvantage against them unless you can do the same. 

I get that this subreddit is delighted about the shotgun headshot multiplier nerfs, but you have to realize that neglecting to tweak the heavy shotgun at all was undeniably a mistake. Now, it's a pump on steroids and a pump user is at a significant disadvantage against a heavy user. The heavy needs to be nerfed in some way (maybe just headshot damage) to lower this disadvantage.

**TL;DR:**
Higher weapon rarities were designed to give an advantage, but not one that weighs the scales in favor of the luckier person too heavily. The heavy shotgun completely defies this by doing everything better than the pump can instead of only dealing more damage like the higher weapon rarities usually do. It has a tighter spread (making it deal more damage at a distance), shoots faster (making it more viable as a single shotgun), and even equips faster than the pump does (giving you a serious advantage in build battles where every second counts). Finding a higher tier of a weapon simply should not give you as large of an advantage as the heavy shotgun does.",FortNiteBR

There is a TLDR at the bottom though if you really have no time.)

Can we stop talking about it? With all the Season 5 hype starting and the climax of Season 4 drawing near, can we stop talking about this so called ‘leak’? I’ve seen various people today using it as a ‘source’ to support the ‘fact’ that Moisty is going to be hit by the rocket. People, get this into your heads- HE WAS MOST LIKELY TALKING OUT OF HIS ARSE. None of what he claimed has happened has happened yet, apart from the map developing each week, but that really could be a lucky guess, and was not just guess work but a bit of detective work around the map and you can see that that was probably going to happen. He also claimed there would be a Leviathan coming out of the ‘egg’ and a big Leviathan LTM, and some silly bull about Alpha/Charlie. Have we seen any of that? No.

I’m also expecting people to say ‘He predicted Season 3 meteor at dusty- no, that was not him, that was another leak that actually was true, and we could believe it on the fact that he predicted something big early on (cannot remember what it was but I’m sure some of you can) before any signs of it happening and everyone turned to him when it happened and realised he was correct about the leak. No such things has happened with Mr Karma Farmer over here.

So stop talking about this ‘leak’. It’s turning into another ‘SOS D5 418’ (Which was actually an April Fools joke gone sort of wrong as everyone just lapped it without bothering to check and it became accepted as facts before anyone could talk out against it) and that was sort of negative because it left no room for fan theories or speculation as everyone thought they knew what would happen. It also makes absolutely no sense for the Visitor to nuke Moisty, what reason would he do that? 

It would be much better if we all started thinking about theorising and putting this jigsaw together. There’s so many things people haven’t considered yet and so much room for amazing theories- How does the dinosaur footprint in B7 fit into this? Could the missile instead be a rocket ready for the Visitor (Keep in mind he is a visitor meaning his stay is temporary) to go home, where we could get a new map? There’s so much- and don’t let a fake leak spoil it again.

TLDR- That leak was most likely fake and we need to focus more on theorising and speculating, and hyping this all up! (Read my last paragraph, it has some interesting theories in (at least for me))",FortNiteBR

First started out very bad at the game (first shooter game, only played Minecraft prior), the only thing I really knew how to do was move and ADS.[ I peaked in early Season 3, obtaining 101 wins that season with 33 of them being solo wins and 3 squad wins being solo squad.](https://i.imgur.com/R2DrDu5.png) Also keep in mind I was at school/sports most of the time so I could only play for about 2-3 hours a day. I only say this so you guys can have an idea of my skill at the game and that it's not just someone who started playing this season. 

**Some Background About How Material Gaining Used To Be**

I remember in Season 2 when those big willow trees with 200 health gave you 40-60 wood, the small little pine trees gave you 40 wood, and when no one farmed the big trees because they sucked. I would always have enough materials towards the end of the game and whenever I killed someone they also had a lot of them. Not having enough materials wasn't really a problem and if it was, it was very rare.

**My Experiences With The New Nerf**

 I didn't really know why they were doing this considering **one of the** big reasons the game is more unique than PUBG or H1Z1 is because of the building aspect of it. Anyways, after the nerf that happened around mid Season 3, I noticed I have had to farm **A LOT** more. I destroy furniture in houses, the bushes and plants around the houses and multiple trees and it still takes me quite a while before I am sitting at a comfortable amount of materials (&gt;600,&gt;200,anything). This last game I was playing, I was top 5 and I caught myself farming because I didn't have any materials. A player should never have to farm in the top 5 let alone top 10. Back then, people weren't as good at the game. I didn't have very many build fights  (maybe once or twice a game) so I didn't have to build as much and didn't really run out of materials. Currently, most of my fights are build fights meaning I run out of materials faster and have to farm more mid game. I loved Blitz and 50v50 because I didn't have to farm as much, the games were much more intense and everyone I killed had enough materials. So, Epic, knowing that the current meta is building, why you choose to nerf materials I just don't really understand..


**My Soulution**

In this video where Daequan in Ninja duo together, [Ninja states how Epic Games was happy in nerfing the materials in the sense that ""If you want to build hard, then you need to work for it a little bit more""](https://youtu.be/uT0lcp5eud4?t=6m35s) I agree that it would be crazy that if a player has a lot of materials at the start of the match and also understand where they're coming from, but if you have 8 kills with 5 people left in the game I don't think you should be farming materials. My solution is to implement a resource multiplier that gets bigger throughout the game. For example, at the start of the game, gaining resources will be what it is currently set at. Let's say, when about 40 people are left the resource multiplier goes up to 1.25x, at 20 people 1.5x, and so on.. Epic can tweak with these numbers with as they feel best but it's just an example of what could possibly be the solution to the ""Resource Crisis"". I feel like this would engage more players in fighting and being aggressive instead of just camping in 1x1's the whole time since they don't have materials. 


Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this.  I hope Epic Games sees this and takes it into consideration.

**TDLR: Nerfing materials while the current meta is building was dumb, so implement resource multiplier to increase throughout game so players don't have to farm as much midgame and also become more aggressive since they have materials.**",FortNiteBR

Then what happened is thousands of other sucky players start upvoting the posts of the other sucky players complaining .Then epic games reads the upvoted posts and changed the mechanic yall complained about which took a dump on skilled players. (nerfed building , nerfed shot gun damage , weapon switch is slow)

All the mosts i see on reddit is about people complaining about part of the game because that part of the game gets them killed..

Good players dont go on reddit because we have nothing to complain about. We took the time out our game to get fast at building and to learn how to aim better ect ...

I use to be a sucky player at this game i use to also complain on reddit but then i got better and realized the stuff i complained about is actually good. Once you sucky players get good at the game you will realize what i mean.

Fornite is trying to limit the skill gap in this game. No one wants to play a game where there is no skill gap. where everyone has a chance to win. Getting victory royals should only be for skilled players. It should be rewarding to get a victory royale. Its somthing you had to grind very hard for to get.

just like in mw2. getting a 25 kill streak nuke was so rewarding. 

even popular players like ninja and dequan agree with what im saying . look at there videos. Daequan just made a video on the material nerf.

you need to earn your right to sustain your build fights. there’s nothing wrong with ditching a fight to go farm a couple hundred mats.... why do they need to make it so that farming takes 5mins and you’re set for the game??

do you not hear how ridiculous that even sounds

just because it’s the hottest game out doesn’t mean you have to play it...

half of you sound so frustrated with “the current meta” and all that jazz...

a guy is double pumping? build 3 stories high and cap him with your own shotgun and then switch to your AR and finish...?

if you have two RPGs, just be a douche back lmao.

that’s what i do.. 

it’s a two way street but those complaining about the mat nerf clearly are new to this game because it’s always been about spending a solid 5-7mins farming for me.

you can also farm on the go on your way to the zone???

i have not had any issues with mats. 

if farming mats is boring to you then go play another game..

Ive played reasonably high kill sniper shootout matches where at least 1/4 to 1/2 of kills were traps. aight that was kinda a long rant but to summarise how i think they should be balanced:

- lower damage to 75
- deal damage to self if inside when activated by an enemy (not self activated)
- increase activation and re-activation times. 

If you agree or disagree share ur thoughts id like to see how other people think of them. And dont give me that “or ur just bad” and actually contribute to the discussion ",FortNiteBR

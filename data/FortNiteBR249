Well, didn’t you imagine what would happen if shotguns faded away? If smgs rules the world? God they’re automatic weapons! Of course building would take a hit.

The first example of came when they randomly changed the trap to 75 damage then bumped it to 150, we all knew someone was making wild decisions. 

I think we all agree these are literally what needs to be changed and PLEASE EPIC: 

1. Revert nerfs to building material health 

2. The pump should have stayed as a 1 pump headshot. the delay added for shotguns would have been perfect by itself! 
It was super satisfying to be able to be in an intense build battle and right at that moment creating an opening and taking the cake wit that pump to the head. 

3. Launchers of all sorts should be reverted to their old blast radius! 

4. C4 should drop in stacks of 2 although I think this is happening? 

Honestly if they reverted these and for the next 3 weeks didnt add a single weapon and focused on fixing performance issues I think we'd all be delighted. 

That's my 2 cents on the matter, what's yours?

Yes a PC player against a console player(using controller) will destroy them, if both good at the game. This is obvious!!  


Are console lobbies easier in normal public playlist, NO. The average skill on console is higher, controllers are easier to use for most people, and more people have consoles growing up so it's normal.  


PC players can't claim their lobbies are harder, you watch any big streamer and they'll run around calling everyone a mobe(mobile player) this just shows how shit a lot of PC players are.  


Should PC and console players be in the same tournament? F\*%K NO. Even though I don't believe console is easier, using a M/K on console is an advantage. So either remove that feature from the game, or have separate tournaments. SO BASIC!

For starters, I'm not complaining. I adapted to the current meta, I have won games the same as before, the game just doesn't feel that much FUN. I haven't played much this season because i don't get the fun factor anymore. I have played since season 1. I'm not the best player, but i consider myself a [decent ](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/steikki)player.

The reason I fell in love with this game was the chess-like battles with building, taking a shot, building cover before you take damage etc. Now the fights are way more boring and you will lose some hp to the spam if the opponent is even remotely skilled. I'm ok with nerfing building, I think they just went a bit too far. People say that spam building in the double shotgun era was stupid, but let's be honest, in the current spam meta you see more spam building than ever before.

Now let's get to the point. Building needed a counter, aka spamming tommy gun apparently. **But the spamming needs also a counter, and that is a fast shotgun shot**. If your opponent is spraying your walls down with tommy gun, you don't have time to switch to a pump and punish him. You need to spam the wall over and over again or switch to a smg and pray you have more hp and better aim(bloom rng).

Picture this scenario: You killed your first opponent, and instantly another guy comes over trying to kill you when you're weak. You just need to build and build and build until he has to reload. If the pump equip delay was removed, you could build a couple of walls, quickly change to a pump and punish the spraying guy and make him scared and maybe make him start building cover for himself.

**TL;DR**

**Building needed a counter: Spamming? Spamming needs a counter: a fast shotgun shot to the face.**

I have a crappy 0.2 K/D so I am not a good player and haven't won any solos, but it would be great if they were able to be earned other than with the battle pass (Which I do own).

Also there is a ""Leaderboard"" section in the lobby where you get matched with 44 or 49 randoms, and to my knowledge serves absolutley no purpose at all whatsoever.

How about making that section worthwhile and having players matched by activity and possibly skill level and also havig a V-Bucks payout for the top 3 places.

Say:

1st: 50 V-Bucks
2nd: 30 V-Bucks
3rd: 20 V-Bucks

Dont get me wrong I hated the DoublePump Meta, it really wasnt fun to lose to these shotguns. But honestly? It was more fun to play. It was just a better overall feeling.

In my opinion if they wont change the smgs the game will lose players.

Just in the last game i died because the enemy outplayed me? No

Did he build better? No

Was he just spraying and destroying my structures faster than I could build them? yes

The problem is not that SMGs are close quarter spray machines. The problem is that 0 skill is involed in using them. Just shoot in the general direction of the enemy and you most likely can kill him.

This is what makes it frustrating and this is also the reason why I will stop playing until they are changed drastically.

Getting killed, because some kid found the left mousebutton and was lucky enough to get an P90 shouldnt be the reason skilled players, that actually invested time and sweat into improving building and positioning are getting rekt.

In my opinion the Double Pump Meta was shit and annoying I tell you that. But even tho I hated DoublePump (maybe because I wasnt doing it myself), I still would change this Spraying Shit for the DoublePump Meta.

Let’s say they revert shotguns to their former glory when a pump did 220 headshot damage and actually worked, make it so you can only carry 3 weapons and 2 heals. This would make it so that you can’t just be sniped by someone who would carry an AR, pump and smg and a sniper, they’d have to go cqc. It would mean you could take a sniper, p90 and AR but have no shotgun. It would make the game more about picking a play style and sticking with it.

Also it’s becoming a real problem that people will only take 1 mini shield as their only heal, so after a fight and you’ve used up all your heals and they’ve dropped nothing so you’re screwed for the next fight, you’ll have 2 heal slots now so they’re a likely going to be at least bandages in those slots. 

Also perhaps add a 6th slot to change up this new meta to allow for one slot of utility items like c4, grenades, impulses etc, 

Just a thought and if people disagree no need to start flaming, but we can at least all agree that this is the most ass meta there’s ever been, reminds me of the doctrine of passing meta in d1.",FortNiteBR

The HP nerf really wasn't that bad. If I didn't read the patch notes I wouldn't have even noticed. Yes I'm being serious. Build-battles still happens every game. Ramp-rushing still works. Turtling with wall spam is still a thing. If you feel you are being shot down more often this season it's because players load outs have changed. People now carry 2 automatics instead of 1. And that's OKAY. Breaking structures was perceived as 'harder' before only because most people ran shotgun over SMG which meant that the only gun worth picking up that could bring down a building efficiently was the AR. I think the hard-to-swallow pill here is that because building is a core mechanic of Fortnite it mustn't be allowed to have any kind of counter. Which is ridiculous.

The pump-shotgun needed to be addressed. Being 1-shot at 200hp was not okay. Double-pumping was also not okay. This extremely accessible gun made season 4 insufferable for anyone that didn't conform. It was a must have weapon and if you didn't have one then you were losing any close-range fight to someone that did. It was promoting an incredibly unrewarding experience and sorely needed to be reworked. It is still viable and works very well on its own or as 1-shot into AR switch, which feels much more balanced.  

While shotguns reigned supreme, the SMG gathered dust in the corner. No one touched them for multiple seasons. Then they were buffed and for a short time they were too strong. Which sent this sub into meltdown. They were tweaked once more in a recent patch and now they seem to be in a good place. No, they are no longer over-powered. Personally, I'd drop my SMG for explosives or Heavy. And I won't even touch the P90 anymore. 

The hysteria on this sub needs to stop. ",FortNiteBR

You land at the factories near salty springs, loot up and harvest for a short amount of time before you see another player who is also trying to learn the same technique and have a somewhat reasonable fight which ends in a few good shotgun hits landing you the kill. Neither players builds are shot down and you are rewarded with some healing giving you the opportunity to heal up before moving to the next location and fighting the next player. You walk passed a few SMGs but decide not to pick them up because it is more effective and enjoyable to use a shotgun landing precision shots. You have put in the effort over the previous 2 seasons to learn the various meta and as a result have an advantage over the newer players. You kill another player who drops a scar, a gun you are very happy to see as it is extremely strong but balanced. You use this scar to take out the final player and land your 35th win.

2. The meta is extremely spammy and unrewarding. Worst meta so far. Best shooter games to date ; AR &amp; Sniper meta.
3. Irrelevant things ; Deagle, burst, famas, pump, tac, semi sniper, revolver, bush and pistol. Buff it or vault them. 
4. The end storm shift is bad. Really bad. I love the idea of something different, but, this shift thing isn't even close to it. The 1v1 at the end needs to be be PVP, not PVE, running/bouncing/flying away from a storm ticking for 10DPS. 
5. The rifts have encouraged 3rd party kills even more. Its already annoying getting ran up on after sick multi kills. 
6. The guns are too loud. Its getting old when players hear something, hide behind a tree, watch the feed for a death and then rush when they see colorful loot fly all over the place and you're sitting there with 11hp. DEAD.
7. Areas with, lets say...7 to 10+ chests, need names. Give areas names...it encourages people to drop there. 
8. Loot lake has got to go. It isn't fun for anyone. Its just annoying. A game ending there is quite torturous. 
9. Some of these new camera angles are really, really bad. It is blinding certain crosshair angles. Not cool. 
10. Change traps to 149. Sometimes it takes 10+ mins to find shield...I would rather be tortured with 1hp than get lobbied. 
11. Rid of tilted. It will spread the player base out more. Its super old getting dubs with 3,4,5 kills because 44 people died 44 seconds in and you wanted to change it up and drop somewhere else but tilted for the 549th time this season. 
12. All of this is just advice. Do whatever the F\*\*\* you wanna' do!!!!!!!!!!!

With that being said, Epic employees are very active on Reddit and respond to lots of top posts. Its a blessing that we have a company so willing to dive right into the community's input. 

However, what is really stopping a small group of Epic employees from studying reddit's upvote system(and the r/FortniteBR's typical upvote/downvote behavior)and then creating a few fake accounts to spread false information.

One example where this could happen could be in a thread after the patch that ended double pumping. What's stopping an Epic employee from using the power of anonymity and commenting why the double pump was so terrible and why pump smg meta will be much better in the weeks to come.

You can say, "" they could just say these things on their official accounts if they really wanted to because its their game and they're going to implement these changes regardless"". I would disagree though, because Epic is very VERY careful about what they post on their official accounts. They aren't afraid to be honest about information, thats for sure but you can't lie that a lot of their comments are direct towards bug fixes and memes the community posts about their game.

I used to play 4 to 6 hours on work nights and basically 8+ hours Saturday and Sunday. Im the type of gamer who gets hooked onto something and spams it to improve as long as there's a skill gap. Did it with FIFA till they removed any noticable skill gap and did it with fortnite.

Now i might open it once or twice during the week, play one game, then get off. 

Reasons:
- shotgun nerf
- build nerf
- explosive buff
- smg over buff 

Basically season 3 was sick.

Shotguns take more skill than other weapons imo cus bloom isn't involved.

Building takes skill cus not anyone can do it and it gives a competitive advantage.

Double pump + build battles (without SMG spraying and explosive spam) were so fun cus it legit just was whoever was better would win. 
I understand that epic didn't want just one way of playing, but their solutions to nerf that style to crap just don't fly with me (and seemingly many others) to the point where I just don't even want to play the game anymore and it's sad. 

I guess it's still ""early access"" and they're trying to experiment with their game, but imo the c4 buff and the pump delay nerf were the start of this game's downfall and it has yet to recover. I can only hope they don't go down the same path EA did with FIFA (basically cater to causals to the point where the skill gap was so small that below avg player could beat any above avg player with relative ease because of the tools exposed to every player in the game, as opposed to leaving it skill based). 

I get that devs want to cater to casuals cus they think $$$$$ and also that if they get shit on all the time, they'll wana quit. But look at season 3. Imo that's when the game was most hyped and that's when so many people started playing, and that was way more skill based than the current meta. I thought epic was diff, but maybe not :/. 

Hopefully they'll seriously think about these types of posts and take things into consideration and make changes accordingly, and soon. Otherwise, I see people leaving this game very quickly (I know I won't go back to hours on end playing this game until positive changes towards skill based mechanics are made, that's for sure).

You thought that because you’d mastered building ridiculous towers in seconds you were finally good at a shooting game. 

Surprise surprise, now that you need to do more with your guns than just pump your shotguns once it turns out you need to learn how to shoot. 

Epic clearly never planned for the building mechanic in this game to turn into 90% of late game encounters and high level competitive matches turning into nothing but frantically building megastructures. Yes, building is important, but it’s also clear that the same boring build battle as the only viable strategy is not a healthy long term plan for this game. 

Epic has been very transparent in their reasons for slowly nerfing building and materials - they want there to be more than one viable strategy to success. Building is still strong and valid and if you can build well and you come up against someone who can’t then the odds are definitely still in your favor. 

If you can’t see that then you’ve got your head in the sand and are being unreasonable. It’s time to either adapt or find a new game. I heard you can build a lot in Minecraft without pesky enemies trying to shoot you too much. Or maybe it’s time to focus on your shooting skills a bit more? ",FortNiteBR

As I ran, I noticed the roadside speed indicator. I had seen it on here before with people testing their speed with impulse grenades and ATK's, so decided I would have a little fun, and do a project of my own.

I noticed that a player running at full speed is indicated to be going a consistent 12 mph. (I could only assume it was miles per hour. I do understand I could be wrong, in which case this whole study would be incorrect)

I decided to use this information to test the size of one single square of the 10x10 grid that the map is broken up into. I built up to max height (to prevent uneven surfaces and obstacles interfering), and built a flat path across one whole square. I then ran in a straight line (as straight as I could), all the way from one end to the other. I did 3 trials and got the average afterwards. **(I will attach a video summary of my trials at the end if you would like to see)**

Here is my data:

* TRIAL ONE: 45.78 seconds
* TRIAL TWO: 45.71 seconds
* TRIAL THREE: 45.65 seconds
* AVG: \~45.71 seconds

A player sprinting travels at 12 miles per hour, or 17.6 feet per second

17.6 x 45.71 = 1 Square

1 Square = \~804.5 ft^(2), or \~0.15 mile^(s)2

The map is divided into a 10x10 grid, but not all 100 squares are filled with island

After some rough measurements I found that the island takes up roughly 68.8 squares

68.8 x 804.5 = 55,349 ft^(2), or \~10.5 miles^(2)

**Anyways, long story short, according to my calculations, the Fortnite island that we all know and love has a total area of roughly 55,349 ft****^(2)****, or 10.5 miles****^(2)****.**

Unfortunately this means you need to hit all pellets on the head for the max headshot output. Which with the heads smaller hitbox is little to impossible.

A solution to this underlying issue is to have a minimum pellet count to deal the max damage on a shotgun, I recommended 3 or 4 but the fortnite discord suggested 5 or 6. 

This just means that if you hit 5 or 6 pellets it will always deal 196 dmg on a heavy which means it's more consistent with it's damage and means it can stand a chance against SMGs.

This is the solution you've all wanted and with the help of this subreddit I'm hoping it will be implemented.

Once you get to circle, one of two things happens... You get bodied because your entire team got annihilated on your way to the circle &amp; now it's some ludicrous MU like 5v32, or you get there and your team has swept the opposition &amp; there's nothing for you to do. Building is pretty much irrelevant in this mode because you're going to happen a dozen other players (including your allies) spraying smgs, grenade launchers, C4, etc... Oh, and speaking of allies... You could honestly argue that your allies are a bigger threat to you than the other team. I've had teammates that'll impulse off mountains, won't revive me just to loot my stuff (even if it's just a small amount of wood &amp; a green pump), will edit from beneath when I'm above them, build over me when going for crate (even though I was there first), destroy my structures while fighting others, etc... The only reason I play 50v50 is because it makes doing certain quest a lot easier. ",FortNiteBR

Well there was a picture there if a zombie like creature. (Maybe from Save The World) I don’t play save the world so I don’t know. But recently it’s been changed to Storm Shield One. That might lead to a cross over between the two modes.
Fortnite might not want to mess up the story line by doing this but I have a theory! 
So the rifts, stuff is spilling out of them? Correct? Yes! 
But there are cracks and rifts without anything spilling out of them. And the theme this season is Worlds Colliding.
Maybe the Fortnite Battle Royale Island is in one world and Save the World is in another. Maybe somehow when The Visitors rocket when through the rift protecting Tilted Towers and opened a rift in Save The World. 
That might be why Save the World was half off and the two skins for the Founders Pack came out on Battle Royale if you owned it. 

Theory One

The two rifts might expand and Save the world might be consumed from the depths and be brought into the Fortnite world, maybe season 6? Or just in general the whole game is changed and there is the monsters that could add a whole new survival technique to the game. 
Fighting monsters erupting from the ground, the storm itself, or the rift in the sky while fighting off other players, running from the storm, gathering materials, and the other basic stuff.
Personally I think it’s a 50/50 risk.

Theory Two

Epic Games could combine the two modes but into and LTM or full on mode. Probably for the for experienced players over all because of all the different situations you can run into. 
Maybe Epic can make separate servers for the players. 
Look at it like this, they program this mode to different difficulty levels that you can’t change.
It takes all of your records, wins, KDR, and everything about the people you’ve killed and their stats and they go into it all. Making a mode where you and all the other people in your lobby are at the same level of you, maybe just a little bit better or worse. 
Imagine having a game mode with players that all have around twenty hours of experience and play time. Almost everyone would be the same and the games would be more intense. 
Plus depending on how good your lobby is depends on how many monsters spawn in, the amount of ammo per drop, what type of guns, medical supplies, and storm damage! 
Imagine the first storm ticking for 5 DPS!

Theory Three

Spic at least does a little cross over cutscene or maybe a loading screen.

On mobile, so sorry for the formatting if it’s odd.

I know you guys have seen a lot of posts bitching about the meta recently, but I haven’t seen any give love to the meta of late season 4.

The meta now is boring and a lot of RNG. Spray and pray has made me not want to play a single game, while before, in seasons 2,3, and 4, I would be playing nonstop. The best thing about the meta of season 4 was that you had options with your loadout. You could double pump if you wanted to, you could pump-tac, or you could pump SMG. ARs became useful with the bloom nerf to silenced SMGS, and the only problem with it was splodes being too OP, with one c4 bringing down all of Tomato Town. 

Epic, do not be foolish. I have seen several posts bitching about the meta and how people have stopped playing. Do not have the “Sit on top because there’s no competition” mentality. You guys have done a great job listening to your playerbase in the past, so what’s the problem now?

Don’t get me wrong, EPIC has done a great job creating an awesome game, but now they’re destroying it brick by brick.

The new meta of S5 has sucked. The spray and pray meta sucks, as now any noob can beat you with an SMG, no matter how good you are or how many mats you have. With the one pump and double pump, at least you could build to escape the shot. With the mats health nerf, this game sucks. I liked the meta of S3. No double pumping, yet the fact one pumping was still in to make up for it. You had to be good to win, SMGs were good close-range, not medium or long range, the bloom wasn't nuts, and XP division wasn't nuts.

The S5 meta of spray and pray and little building sucks, and you might as well have an inventory of a SMG, hunting rifle, and grenade launcher, with 200 mats and 2 slots for meds. This season has sucked. 

Another thing is mid-tier players. Pros can build like mad and can still win, noobs can just spray and pray. The mid-tiers (like me), have to deal with pros who can destroy you with any other weapon, and noobs who can't build, they just shoot. With S4, noobs could build when they were shot. The new meta just makes the game hella boring. AND THE MIDGAME. Recall when the mid game had 50-40 players? Welcome to 20 players and no encounters till the last two circles!

Epic is appealing way too much to noobs, and as a result, has dumbed the game down for everyone. Greed can destroy a game, and we're seeing that here.

I would like to see a few changes to reduce the frustration and toxicity it brings to squad games.

Firstly, for this to work, kill counts should be removed and have knock counts implemented instead. Then whenever you knock a player you simply loot the enemy instead of finishing them off.

The biggest issue that comes from this is having an enemy player know your location and movement, so some kind of view-reduction/blackout would need to be introduced.

It would also be somewhat disruptive to the Friday Fortnites format.

Long time player here. Been around since season 1 and have somewhere near 300 wins. I play regurlarly when I don't spend time at work or with my SO.
I've seen the jump pads come and go, I've seen ceiling zappers, guided missiles, jet packs and everything in between and I'd admit it, some of them were really bad and some were really fun. And I've always built to keep up with these weapons.

Now however, since the nerfs of building and rise of ""spam weapons"" such as all the new SMGs and LMGs building isn't anyplace near where it once were. This makes me sad because this is really the best thing Fortnite had going for itself. 
Instead, in the effort to try to make Fortnite a competetive E-sport they're nerfing building so the spectating experience isn't as lousy as it has been, or at least that's what I think. 
I might be just a sad voice drowning in all the other complaints but I've really invested both time and money in this game to have it evolve into this bullet spamming bullshit. Feelsbadman

Regardless if i double ramp with walls or single ramp with walls and floor, they will easily melt my ramp; especially with any smg and assault rifles. Not to mention the c4s, rpg and explosive damage buff against buildings. 

My issue with the game isnt due to the shotty pump nerf against structures, or the pull out time even after the double shotty nerf or the overall decrease in damage, it is the heavy emphasis on decreasing materials health and materials gain. Who asked for this? And to top it off, you add smgs with high rate of fire and explosive damage increase on multiple structures within its radius? Like wtf epic? Fortnite is about building! And building is an essential part of the game but It is an incredibly boring and tedious chore that has to be done every match for at least 5 mins with 600-700 wood minimum if you want to stand a chance in a fight with someone, especially with the new spray and pray meta with smgs and such. 

All im saying is that, this game is heading down the wrong path, catering towards low skilled individuals who would rather spray and pray as opposed to learning the essential mechanic of the game which is building. Why not implement a mandatory building tutorial as opposed to leveling the playing field by getting rid of the skill gap? Why not revert the materials health? They were fine as is, and please increase mat gains as a single smg clip can eat thru 50-60 wood (5-6 walls) thats at least 2-3 harvested trees!

I had the most fun during season 2 and 3 and that’s when the game was, in my opinion, in its best state. Building was the key to winning, build battles were on the rise and all weapon types were viable. The skins were dope and the map was well balanced for early-, mid- and endgame.

I‘m a bit biased but I think the state the game is in right now isn’t good at all. I mean, you can hate double pump, that’s completely fine, but did you ever stop and say „that was a fun fight, gg“ to a guy that non stop spammed you with a minigun/smg/lmg? I really doubt it.

The game is slowly trying to make the building aspect less prominent, which will ultimately be this games downfall. It got popular because of building, why nerf it? I get that you’re trying to push it into competitive, but why? It’s already the biggest game out there. And if you want tournaments, why not go with the Friday Fortnite Keemstar tournament outlay? Kills count, it’s duo vs squad (which is insanely fun to look at) and it just isn’t boring because people don’t turtle their way into the zone.

Downvote me all you want or tell me to git gud, this is my opinion and I stay by it. The game has become less enjoyable for me. So unenjoyable that I seriously can’t wait for the competition to give Epic some pressure.",FortNiteBR

1. Nerfing the hp on building structures.

2. Buffing the pickaxe damage to structures to demolish build battles etc.

3. C4 buffed. (Tramendously)

4. Explosives, now do 1100 damage to all structures instead of 300-400 like they did in season 1-2-3.

5. Nerfing materials, slowly but they're doing it. Llama nerf, trees, materials out of chest downed by 10.

6. Buffing certain trees and giving them more hp around the map, so it takes longer to farm.

7. Jetpacks, they're not in the actual game but they will add them back. Making it easy to take high ground.

8. Nerfing the amount of damage shotguns do to structures.

9. Tac/pump headshot nerf, plus pullout delays. 

10. Smgs, high damage high accuracy high rate of fire. Shreds through buildings, some contain high amounts of ammo to spam. (No skill) what so ever.

11. Removal of double shotguns, when they were already nerfted to hell.

12. Forcing us to use smgs, and not other metas that we enjoy. We should be able to have a variety, of what we want to use.

13. First shot accuracy, this was implemented into the game a few months back. And it allows you to get lazerd, or bloom gets you.

14. First shot accuracy, should of never been implemented. Bloom shouldn't be in the game.

15. The guns should have recoil and fall off damage, i played a ltm back in the day that they accidently put out. And it felt so clean, and nice. They never talked about it again. It's on YouTube if you've never seen it, you'll love it.

16.  Most of the things they did was never asked for or nor was it a game breaking mechanic, they continue with these things that nobody wanted/asked for. And the lack of feedback they have been providing lately hasn't been good.

During this time everyone had a choice of what to use whether it be double shotgun, shotgun smg, or single smg. 

But since Epic decided to nerf shotguns once again (why though), all I see in this game is SMGs. Let me tell you, the most boring thing in the world are SMG fights, literally. There really is no thrill in killing someone with an SMG or winning SMG battles.

Playing squads, we all seem to random. Two kids and two adults (I’m 24 my teammate sounded about my age). One kid asks us how old we are and then instantly dies leaves. 

Dialog with the remaining kid and guy, we’ll call him Jim for formatting :

Jim: “Why are kids so obsessed with age?” 

I had no idea this was a thing but I went with it, turns out Jim’s observation was pretty spot on.

Me: “I don’t know man, I am glad to hear someone my age though.”

Kid turns on his mic: “How old are you guys?”

The timing here and the fact that the kid sounds like his mic is on the floor had me rolling. We told him and he starting asking more questions, at this point we are trying to fight another group.

Kid: “Do you guys know how old I am?”

Me: “12 maybe 9 I guess.”

Kid: “I’m 13”

Silence (cooool..?)

Kid: “Do you guys think  a boy or a girl?

Me: “What do YOU think you are? 🤔”

Kid: “I want you guys to guess”

Jim: “A girl”

Kid starts going off that he’s a boy and no one ever knows. There’s no ending here except we pretty much die at this point.

I know going into season 5, Epic's main goal was to increase and provide more options for mobility. I get it. No one likes getting caught in the storm, no one likes unlucky storms where you have to spend the entire round running, and no one likes getting stuck in a location without loot.

I think, however, when we're looking at the game candidly and critically, we can see that the game is in a bad spot right now.

Cutting right to it, I think the over-abundance of mobility options (slowing the storm speed, shopping carts, ATKs, launchpads, rifts, bounce pads) has tilted the meta in the complete opposite direction. Whereas before it was a struggle to stay within the storm, it's now so easy to move around the map that it kind of breaks the game a bit.

And I think the root of this issue are two recent additions in particular, and how pervasive the are in the current game: ATKs and Rifts.

These two items have turned the game from ""oh shit, I have to stay ahead of the storm and play defensively and think about how I push other teams"" to basically giving top-tier players free reign to troll the entire map to intervene in fights, pick off healing teams that have just won a fight, and basically immediately push and laser mid-tier teams and lower.

And before some asshat comes into the comments with ""lol git gud"", it's not that intervening in fights or taking advantage of a wounded team wasn't always a viable strategy. It's just that now, whenever you make ANY noise on the map, you can bet your ass 3 teams will be rifting/driving in to vulture you. It's tough for even the upper-tier, non-streamer players to weather 2-3 simultaneous waves of teams effectively.

One of the big problems I think is just how many of these things spawn on the map. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY RIFTS AND THEY ARE NOT RANDOMIZED. Same, more or less, for ATKs. I don't think I'd mind these two mechanics if they were very rare, similar to finding a Llama currently, but they're a reliable way to hop-skip across the map in no time. But everyone know where rifts are on the map, they aren't randomized at all, and it makes patrolling the map to intervene in fights way too do-able.

I think the solution here is not to get rid of these mechanics, but to drastically scale back how present they are in the game. They're cool mechanics: rifts feel really good to use, and ATKs have the most balance out of either with their loudness. It just shouldn't be a given that you're going to find one every. single. match. I think it's pressuring people into un-fun play styles that penalize anyone who isn't super-confident in their spray-and-pray ability.

I've been playing since season 1, and a lot has been made of the ""spray and pray"" meta now with reduced building and increased SMG prowess. I think, in conjunction with overly-empowered movement mechanics, it's all contributing to one of the worst, most unfun, lease versatile metas we've had in the game thus far.

TL;DR — Rifts and ATKs were a fun, if wholly unnecessary, addition to the game and have made all of Season 5 frustrating. I'd recommend dramatically scaling back the spawns of these two items to re-balance the same. Keep the slower storm speed, though.

I’ll admit back in season 2 double pumping was way to OP and sense then there has been a lot of controversy around it, they tried fixing it in season 3 but throughout that time there were many people complaining about it being was to OP and a lot of people saying it’s balanced and to keep it, personally i would say at the time it wasn’t balanced and it was too OP,  then finally in season 4 double pump was changed again, and you could do it, but it’s speed was fairly balanced, and overall no one was complaining about double pump and the game was in a fairly good state gameplay wise. Then suddenly when season 5 came out, the game was struck with a shotgun nerf the would forever change double shotgunning, this initial change added a delay from being able to shoot your shotgun after shooting a shotgun then switching to another shotgun or from your current shotgun to another gun to your shotgun again, this change was the first step in changing the meta to essentially just camping in towers and holding down a button spraying with an SMG. The first day of season 5 people quickly realized if you can’t double shotgun then they need another alternative, so it created Pump + SMG (pump+tac smg, pump+suppressed smg, pump+drum gun) Or people sometimes even just ran an SMG of some sort and NO shotgun bcuz SMGS overpower shotguns, this change in tactics caused many people to instead of build battling or having a decent shotgun fight, stay in a 1 by 1 and spray you down with an SMG bcuz SMGs do so much damage and have such a high fire rate and it’s as simple as holding down a button and it lasers people. It only took a few days after season 5’s release for people to notice that SMGs are super overpowered and probably the best guns in the game. This shift in the meta also punished aggressive players because whenever they try and push another player they would get spammed by an SMG. at this point i saw a lot of people talking about how SMGs are OP and take no skill to use and destroy gameplay, and i had to agree. I mean i used to be able to solo squad and now solo duos, or solo squads is significantly harder because you try and fight a full duo/squad and you will get spammed from 2+ different directions and there’s nothing you can do about it. With many people complaining about SMGs being way too OP Epic Games thought it would be a good idea to take out an SMG (Tactical SMG) and replace it with an EVEN better SMG the normal SMG, when they originally did this i was so confused on what they were thinking, SMGS needed a nerf and instead of nerfing them they add an even better one?? awhile goes by with no change in gameplay, just a bunch of people spraying with SMGs, eventually in the news page a new gun appears called the Compact SMG, instantly i could tell this is a P90 and at the current state the games in this gun is going to be more OP than the rest and gameplay will just get worse. Later that same night the gun appeared in news page the guns stats were leaked on reddit, it said the guns magazine size = 50 (correct) fire rate = 0.05 (incorrect) damage = 15/16 (incorrect) so atleast Epic didn’t make the fire rate on the gun as fast as it said on the leak, luckily they made it shoot every 0.10s so essentially 10 shots per second, so it empty’s it’s mag in 5 seconds, still Insanely OP. However the damage of the gun in the leak was also incorrect, instead of the gun doing 15/16 DPS which is still very op considering how fast the gun fires and how large it’s clip is, the gun does 21/22 DPS, to put that in perspective the Compact SMG can kill player with no shield in 0.5s and a player with full shield in 1s (not including headshots) 
with headshots it can kill a player with 100HP in 0.3s if you hit 3 headshots in a row (very possible considering this gun is a laser beam it’s so accurate at close range) and can kill a player with 200HP in 0.5s. What i don’t understand is why epic make it so you can’t 1 pump people anymore but they made it so an SMG could kill someone with 200HP in a second without a single headshot. So essentially with all of the people complaining SMGs are too OP Epic Games decides to add the Compact SMG which is 2x better than all the other SMGs, i’m genuinely curious as too what Epic is thinking when they do these things, we got 2 new SMGs all better than the previous ones when all we wanted is SMGs to get a nerf. To think that all this started because you can’t double shotgun, so in my opinion the ability to use 2 shotguns without a delay kept the game balanced, also not only did this change not allow you to double shotgun it also made it much harder to use the Shotgun Build method (essentially it was being above someone and jumping off of a build above someone into open space and shooting them with your shotgun out of the air then building a floor below you then jumping off again shoot them and build below you and you would keep repeating that till your enemy either build up or was dead) now when you shotgun then build a floor below you and switch back to your shotgun so there is a delay before you can shoot again and it makes it much harder to use that method, a simple fix to that would be epic could be straight up with their end game goal and make it so we can only carry one shotgun in our inventory at a time, if they did that they could remove the delay from being able to shoot again, but doing that would also have its downsides, and also i’m just going to add in season 4 i didn’t hear many people complaining about double shotguns being OP (because it wasn’t OP but Epic still removed it and put the game in the toxic state it’s in) but i do hear many people complaining abt how SMGs are too OP and yea, the SMG buff made it a lot easier for bad players to get wins but like if you think abt it the bad players could either get wins by being cucks and holding down a button and spamming people with SMGs (which is sadly very effective) or the bad players could learn from their deaths, kills, mistakes, and sometimes even wins and keep improving themselves so that they can become much better at the game and be able to get wins without spraying... this whole SMG meta is spoiling the noobs and when/if it gets nerfed the noobs will have no idea what to do and that will make it harder for them. So on top of all these issues with SMGs being way to OP, Instead of giving SMGs the HUGE nerf they need Epic decides it would be a good idea to put the Guided Missile back into the game, and i haven’t even mentioned how OP explosives are in this game yet, but essentially one shot from an RPG can bring down an entire 1 by 1 and i think that alone explains how OP explosives are. But Epic put back an RPG but you can control where it goes... Did Epic not remember last time the Guided Missile was in the game? That was probably the second worse state the games ever been in, the state its currently in being the worst it’s ever been. I honestly don’t understand what Epic is thinking recently...",FortNiteBR

I want to thank Epic for not just making a video game, but by making a form of entertainment that allows friends to bond together.

I'm only 17, and for the last 6 years I've known one of my best friends, Tristan. We live in a rural area, and the school bus did not go to my house so I would always get dropped off at my grandparents house. Tristan's house was only two houses down, and he would always invite me over to play Black Ops 2 zombies when it first came out. This went on for years, us buddies having a good time after school playing on his PS4. I only had a PC so I could only play with him after school at his house.

When we approached junior high, we got separated because we were not in the same classes. We always remained friends and always talked on the bus after school and texted each other. We would always compete in random mobile games after school on the bus and always have a good time because each day our bus ride was over thirty minutes long.

Soon enough, grade 11 was around the corner and we only had one class together. By this point, Tristan had a job at Tim Horton's and would work 4 to 11 every night after school. He worked so much that he was able to buy a 2015 Subaru Impreza and be able to pay for it. He was so proud of it. He told me he would stay up until 4 am every night just so he could play games and talk with friends since he did not have any other time during the day. He would only get 3 and a half hours of sleep each night and be okay with it because he still wanted to keep up with friends and have fun with them.

Eventually, Tristan and a few others convinced me to play Fortnite with them, and they told me it was cross platform. For the first time ever I could play with Tristan and I feel so lucky that I got to spend these last few months closer to him than before. We would stay up late some nights playing Fortnite, and we would always have a good time.

Eventually, one of the worst days of my life happened, and most people that I know personally agree that it was the worst for them to. May 29, 2018, on our lunch break at school, Tristan and three other people hopped in his car to go out for lunch, and tragedy struck and Tristan got in a T-bone collision going 110 km/h. The other three were taken to hospital (and they are okay now, thank goodness) but Tristan was pronounced dead at the scene. Pronounced dead at 17 years old. I still can't believe it happened, and even two months later, a single day hasn't gone by where I haven't deeply thought about it. I went to the scene about 10 minutes after the crash, and it was the most horrific thing I have ever seen. School was shut down and people were comforting each other, and the next day everyone wore pajama pants to school in his honor, as Tristan would always wear pajama pants to school, except for PJ day where he would wear denim. haha

Tristan's funeral was held on June 9, 2018, and they had all his personal belongings on display, including his PS4 that we used to play on. :( A lot of people attended his funeral and lot of people loved him, and he will be missed by many.

I felt I had to say something like this to get the story off my chest and since I was inspired by the post yesterday. Thank you Epic Games, for making a cross platform game so I could become closer to one of my best friends in the last few months of his life.",FortNiteBR

2.8 kd this season
8.5% win rate this season
#7000th in total kills this season

This is playing casually to have fun, sweating hard, doing challenges then eliminating self, etc. Ok now that ive given you an idea of what im like as a player:

Negativity is bad for you and others so just stop. Take a break. Ive barely been playing and actually been playing STW a lot, its really fun. If you want to get good pay attention to what better players are doing to beat you and try that. Its what i did. Getting good requires you to practice in games before you worry about trying to win or get a lot of kills. If you're already good but hate the state of the game then take a break. Anyone who says they're good but hates the state of the game is either not enjoying the game anymore or they just aren't good anymore and they dont want to have to practice to get good again.

The game changes so you have to change too. If you're not good yet; practice and get out of your comfort zone or you'll never get good.

You can read all the pro tips you want but just know that pros got good for the most part on their own trying to get better anyway they could.

I tried isolating the incident of when it crashes, but I have been also getting crashes in the lobby. The crashes go a little something like this: I will be playing, for an random amount of time, game will freeze frame. Then crash, with Unreal 4 crash report. I have looked this up and it is not an isolated incident it seems. A lot of PC users are experiencing the same problem and there doesn't seem to be any true fix. Before anyone asked, I have updated my drivers on my graphics card and peripheral equipment. Latest version of Windows 10, etc. Cleaned my registries. Mostly doing this to get some more awareness since I know that Epic employees view this sub. Also of note, when running the game a warning message appears saying that my graphics card is not updated to 18.7.3 and may experience compatibility issues. Problem is AMD hasn't released this update yet (not listed on their website) so I am a bit confused.

Specs on PC:  


R9 390x 8gb update 18.7.1  
MSI B150M board  
Intel i5-6500  
8gb RAM

With the ""OP shotgun meta"" still around, 1v4's were difficult, but doable. By building correctly and shooting at optimal points and hitting your shots, a 1v4 required skill and efficiency that few people possessed. 

Now, an extremely experienced and skilled player has little to no chance against 4 people who have never touched Fortnite before but understand that holding down mouse1 means spray.

I'm not writing this from personal experience, I'd consider myself a good player but I rarely solo squad. However, the disadvantage of solo squadding or even being a single man down is too great. The fact that there is literally no chance for a player to outplay any four semi-competent players is just a bad meta.

Let some of the pro's go into a solo squad match to show them how long it takes before one team with all spam weapons kills them or at least makes them burn through a bunch of mats before they can finally take a shot. Im just really convinced the devs dont play this game enough to understand the issues that effect the game (i.e. spam meta, building nerfs, shotty nerfs, all those major changes that are lowering the skill gap each update). Maybe itll give the devs a different look at their changes if they hear out the top tier players and suggestions.

First of all, I know there are great chances that this post will go deep in the abyss of the subreddit and I’m fine with it. I guess I just need to give my opinion about the current state of the game. Most of it has already been said in the past, many times, but I believe a reminder is never a bad thing. (Be ready, it’s going to be a long post, there will be a TDLR at the end if needed)

Second of all, let me tell you that I started the around mid-season 2. I’m FAR from being the best, but I believe I can hold my own if needed. I’ve enjoyed this game since I started and this is not just another rant about the reasons I can’t win, rather a post about how things aren’t going (in my opinion) the right way for the future of the game. 

Now, allow me to mention what I think isn’t going in the right direction right now. 

The current ADS state isn’t enjoyable. I can’t see anything on half of my screen when I’m aiming and I believe it has a worse effect than we think on our gameplay. 
Obviously, the current building/spray and pray meta is hard to enjoy. It’s now all based on, well, spraying. You got an SMG/Drum gun ? You’ll be fine. This isn’t what this game was built for. The ONE thing that really sets you apart from the rest is building. You know it, we know it and yet, we’re going further and further away from it every update. I get that you want to give players several ways of winning aside from building, but it’s going too far. Due to that, what many people enjoyed a lot isn’t possible anymore. At some point, Solo games are just too boring for great players (not me, I’m trash) and they tend to golf Solo/Duo or Solo/Squad. Although I believe Solo/Duos is still playable, I have the feeling that Solo/Squads is near impossible to achieve. What I mean is the best players of the games are going to get bored of it all, I’ll get back to that below.
This isn’t the most important point, but I still believe it’s worth mentioning. For a couple moths now, we haven’t received nearly as many communication from you guys than we were used to. I don’t mind changes. Change in general is a great thing and is needed. Just let us know why you do it, not just once every 3 months to tell us that you want people to have another way of winning except by building. Not directly related, but look at the Summer Skirmish. We have no idea what’s happening nor who’s playing until, what, 2 hours before the tournament ? This is a 500k$ a day tournament, not a local, 1000$ prize one. The communication should be on par with that. (Mind you, I’m not complaining about the Summer Skirmish itself, I believe that it’s a great event with great casters and week 3 showed us what it could look like for things to be interesting for the viewer AND still competitive). 
I’m not an Xbox/Switch player, but from what I’ve seen, the current state is just bad.  It simply looks unplayable. We’re talking about billions here and I don’t think anybody would play a game in this state if it was coming from Activision or EA (not same size, alright, but you get my point). 
I guess my main issue is that the current meta is the most repetitive from game to game I have seen so far. I don’t really bother building anymore, I just tend to press forward, take my P90 or my drum gun, aim, shoot until I can go through the enemy’s wall and keep on shooting until said player is dead. I works, sure, but it's not that fun. 

All these points are here for improvements, not just a free rant. As well, I’m not saying that the entire game has become trash, I still play it and enjoy it. Playground has probably been the best thing to come to this game and many POI have made the map way more interesting than season 4 in my opinion.

Now, stating all these problems is one thing, I guess finding the solutions is another. So what could be done? 

For the ADS state, I’ll be quite honest, I have no idea. I know I don’t feel comfortable crouching and aiming at the same time, but the previous peaking meta was too much as well. 

Regarding the spray and pray meta, the double pumping nerf was alright (end of season 4, if I recall correctly). You could pick up a shotgun of any type, and you then had several options (Drum gun, several types of SMG, AR), now I’m not even taking an AR nor a shotgun anymore. The changes were great, but I believe it went a bit too far with the nerfs on building and the buff on SMGs. Going back to end of season 4’s state wouldn’t be that bad. 

I get that the whole point of the current meta is to allow everybody to play and enjoy the game without having to put 500 hours to play alright. Maybe a skill-based matchmaking could be a solution to that. Maybe a separate ranked mode could be as well, so it would cater to everybody’s need. It seems to work alright on others games (although I don’t have much experience with these systems), I don’t see why it wouldn’t work on this one. 
Keeping players that play a lot is extremely important for Epic, whether streamers or simply big players. Adding challenges based on skills (numbers of kills with X weapon, number of wins,…). A French streamer was talking about it the other day and, for many, the current state is « well I have 5-6-7-800 wins, there isn’t a single reason for me to play more than a few hours a week on a Tuesday/Wednesday for the new update, so I’ll stream something else ». 

I guess my main point is the following. Epic, you got us used to something amazing. There were great changes on a regular basis (whether map-based - e.g. season 4 - or « meta-based ») and we loved it. You guys used to let us know what was going on, why things were done and we loved it as well. 
I’m aware that it isn’t an easy thing to do but, bit by bit, all those great things aren’t really here anymore and well, that’s a problem for us humans. It’s in our nature never to be satisfied with what we have, to always want more. And obviously, the more we receive, the more we want. 

We love you Epic, and love that you’re still trying to make things great. I’m sure you guys will do what you can to make as many people happy. Just be careful and think about the mid-long term and not just the short one. Casual players WILL move away at some point, whether you want it or not, that’s just the lifecycle of a game. I do think that you also want to think about those that want to stay on it for a long time. 

I just finished writing the post and I just realized how long it is, sorry about that! I’m probably repeating myself a lot, sorry for that as well..  

TDLR: The game is currently in a bad state for its future growth, streamers and big players are becoming more likely to move elsewhere and players will follow. 
Not everything is bad, the playground was a GREAT addition, but we kinda need more reasons to stay. ",FortNiteBR

I can confidently say this is the first game I've ever played where I can still feel this way after a year.  The reason that I am still excited to play, is because the game constantly changes.  I for one did enjoy using a double pump, but when Fortnite got rid of the double pump and nerfed shotguns, then buffed SMG's, I thought it was brilliant! People you need to understand that change is good, if we were playing the same game over and over again wouldn't you get bored? Now we have SMG's that actually are worth using and forces us to play the game with new strategy's.  It's awesome.  Also for everyone getting pissed over bugs, they are bound to happen.  Fortnite implements these patches within a couple of hours once a week.  No matter how many programmers are on your team, with these updates there are bound to be bugs.

I checked a fortnite shop history that the clover has only been sold 3 times! last seen 114 days ago!

The rarity index is 30 while skull troopers rarity index is 40! Pretty close. So is the sgt green clover officialy a rare skin!?

Note: I own the skin and i probably have seen 1 or 2 clovers since it was in the shop which is crazy!!

I have honestly seen more skull troopers then clovers!

Thoughts??

But other times, they really miss the mark. Here are a few fixes that were worse than the problems they were designed to solve:

1. Double pump nerfs - first, Epic nerfed the pump so hard that the only way to use it was to double pump. Yes, Epic made the problem worse by making the gun so bad the only way to use it was in it's most powerful state - double pump. After forcing double pumping and confused why the issue hasn't been solved, Epic eliminated the possibility of comboing all shotguns all together while leaving the pump nerfs in place.

The solution is to redesign the pump. Go back to the drawing board and make it work as intended. My solution is to add a chamber to the pump that auto-reloads from the tube. This way, there is no ability to animation cancel and each shotgun has memory that forces you to pump the shotgun after it has been fired. Here's a link with a more in depth description:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/92wa5z/add_a_chamber_to_the_pump_prevents_double_pump/?utm_source=reddit-android

2. Ghost peeking - I've only been killed by ghost peeking and handful of times. Epic overshot the nerf and introduced a camera angle that is extremely obstructing and requires players to expose so much of themselves when they peek. 

The solution is to find a middle ground with the camera angle or just let players ghost peek. It can be countered and is less frustrating than the current state of the game.

3. They over-nerfed the best part of the game - building. Decreasing floor mats, buffing explosives, making it harder to farm, and reducing material health have all negatively affected building. 

The solution is to increasing mats availability to decrease farming and revert the mat health nerf. 

There's a lot more to discuss, but I think these three things are most important to return the game to it's former glory! ",FortNiteBR

1. When you have high ground you are exposing way too much of yourself to shoot down at someone. If I build a 1x1 up two levels and shoot at someone on the ground standing still, they are still likely to do damage because of the visibility of my character’s head

2. Aiming down sight while crouched with any skin (I’ve had the happen with drift, omega, Raven, wukong, etc) puts your camera right into your characters shoulder rather than your characters line of sight. That’s an issue. ",FortNiteBR

Every week the game is basically changing.

Meta right now is mainly Spray and Pray with Tommy Gun and Smgs. And on top of that the wood walls get nerfed.

Everytime i do double ramp pushes they get instantly melted by an Ar or An Smg. 

In my opinion a hotfix is needed right now, nerf the Damage to Buildings.

Especially if you were really good at timing it and swapping at the precise time. Though with all the hatred for the DP epic nerfed it patch after patch. It was nerfed so many times that it became ineffective and weak. Yea DP was a glitch but these new nerfs don't make the pump any better. Matter a fact, the pump does no damage even if you hit your shots. On top of that, you can be pumping someone just for them to one shot you. It's so frustrating man...the pump is even so sluggish and it has this super lengthy delay on it. I swap to my shotty wait ages for it to come out then shoot only to do 58 damage headshot. They don't have to bring back double pump that's not what I'm asking, I'm saying at least buff the pump if you're going to make it so inconsistent and slow. I'm sure the majority of players agree with me. Even combat is 50x slower in battles. I have to pump someone 3x and spray to finish them off and my aim is accurate.

However, the thing is that shotguns are still viable in the current spray meta and they don't completely suck and depend on RNG like the ARs.
Personally, the thing that disturbs me more is that rifles, which are the core weapon in any shooting game are almost useless at the current state of the game. Even before season 5, although people used rifles, they depended too much on the RNG of the bloom. Now, the most popular argument to why bloom is good is that otherwise people will melt other players with ARs which I don't believe is true. ARs don't shoot so fast at this game and players who are hit have plenty of time to build cover for themselves (unlike being fucked by P90 let's say). Moreover, implementing a recoil system like a proper shooting game would add skill to the game which is very much lacking right now, and also will make it harder to melt players with an AR. As a side note, I much prefer having the option to be melted by a legendary scar, than by a blue SMG or a double shotgun for example.

Adding more skill to the game will also make the game way more enjoyable to watch and little kids who watch insane plays will try to get better at the game. The current meta is only hurting the game and I don't think it attracts players any better than previous seasons of the game, but it sure as hell can make old players quit it.

It should now be an ability to where you can press jump whilst in air, and you get a sudden boost of upward momentum, sort of like a bounce pad. After using the ability, you should be immune to fall damage. It should have a cool down time of 10-15s

I also think back packs should have their own slot (this because there is also a chance of epic adding a storm tracker back pack that was accidentally leaked some time ago)

You are also vilible to the enemys on the map if you have the flag, simulat to how it was in the Thanos gamemode.

* Textures not rendering (mostly at the beginning of the game)
* Micro Stutters randomly in the game
* Freezes in the Game
* Items still invisible
* Dead Player Models standing around and blocking the way as if they were still alive

If you drop and you see the texture didn't render again, it kills your motivation to play any more rounds, at least  that's the way it is with me.

And i know that all of the PC and PS4 Players probably are already sick of seeing dozens of posts about this, but I (or hopefully the whole Xbox and Switch Community) just want an answer on this from Epic

Because right now I feel lost, which is sad because i really love this game.

Sorry for my English.",FortNiteBR

Short TLDR first - I want to design a training program that will put me in a position to qualify for the world cup

A bit of background on my history as a gamer - I've been playing games since I was 6, starting off with an original gameboy. I've been playing pc games since my early teens, that's blossomed into a passion for any games that could be seen as competetive (star craft, warcraft, counter strike, league of legends, overwatch, etc.) 

Now my history with fortnite - Started playing in season 3, fell in love with fortnite due to the building. Dumped loads of hours into the game and made it to the point I would have considered myself a well above average player. I ended up taking a break mid way through season 5 due to the meta feeling stale and other things I needed to prioritize life wise. 

Started playing again seriously mid way through season 7, mechanically my basics were there although everything felt rusty and slow, not to mention the new items, poi's etc. I've been pushing myself hard to improve and I've managed  to cobble together the basic skills I used to have.

Where I'm at now - I absolutely fell in love with playing the pop up cups due to the higher level of skill overall in the lobbies. I managed to achieve a pin in every pop up I've played. 

That brings me to  currently, the share the love series - I saw this as an opportunity to truly test myself and see where I ranked among the more serious competetive players. I played the placement matches and managed to get 16 points landing in the contenders division. I'll admit I was a little disheartened playing the first round in contenders and managing to get 0 points, luckily this only strengthened my resolve to improve.

Since the first round I've been doing everything I can to improve from YouTube tutorials, twitch streams, creative maps. Working on everything from game sense, mechanical skills, rotations, drop points, mentality, everything I could get my hands on. Since then I managed to achieve 2 points, 4 points, 7 points and most recently 14 points. This improvement has further lit a fire under me to push myself to be able to compete with the best with the ultimate goal of playing in the world cup.


Finally that brings me to my initial point of positing and why I'm here.

I'm seeking help in designing a training program that will be extremely focused on helping me improve and bring myself up to that level. 

Im open to hearing any and all advice, answering any questions you may have or anything that is deemed necessary to my success.

There are a few basic questions I'm trying to answer 

1. How much time should I be investing in practicing per day?
2. How can I decide which areas I need to improve on the most?
3. How do I decide which areas take priority for improvement?
4. How do I even approach designing an overall plan to get me there?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!",FortniteCompetitive

Whats not made clear here is how the qualifiers will work. 

1. Will you need to qualify in the first week to play in the second week and further weeks.

2. How will qualifying for the final work? Will you have to play in each week and the top competitors over the total 10 weeks qualify? Hopefully not as this will take place during summer in the UK where alot of people will be away on holiday for at least a week. I also think its alot to ask for people to be free every weekend for 10 weeks straight.

I know the post has only just been announced and I am not hating, I just want there to be an equal opportunity and fair chance for everyone of an eligible age to be able to compete without having to quit work/school/holidays and entire social life for 10 weeks.",FortniteCompetitive

Here’s how it’ll work - we’re going to run solo games until we have enough for duos, which from experience has been at least 40 people. The solo games are tilted only drops, W key only, no scrim bullshit, 5-10 min games. Can ONLY drop tilted and cannot leave tilted. If the last few people are hiding we leave the match and start again. No one cares who wins, we’re here to slay tf out and have fun. 

We’ve been running duo FILL for the first few games once we switch over to duo scrims, which means YES, you’ll be with a random partner as your duo for a couple of the scrims. It’s been WICKED fun meeting new people and figuring out each other’s play style. After a couple games we start playing with our actual duos. 

Here are the rules for those who for whatever reason don’t listen on stream or read on discord:

No planes. Not even for rotations with 1 hp because you took 99 fall damage and the storms right behind you. Getting in a plane is an automatic ban (we have a discord where you have to link your epic so it’s incredibly easy to figure out who everyone is and just lock you out of the customs code channel). 

No fighting until the second circle CLOSES. So no fighting until 3rd zone. A lot of scrims allow you to fight off spawn if you “feel threatened”. I don’t like gray areas as a lot of people interpret shit the way they want instead of how it actually is, so to limit that and get the best end games possible, you can’t shoot your gun til 3rd zone. Now, if for whatever reason someone starts to kill you, by all means fuck them up with no remorse. If someone’s breaking the rules by shooting at you just come to the stream and drop their name. 

No storm pushing. Easy enough. 

Last rule, no anonymous mode. 

I recommend equipping your tomatoes to see who’s near you as the second circle closes, as it makes these games a whole lot more fun :)",FortniteCompetitive

I think that's bullshit. 

There is no reason a BR can't be as competitive as the current top ESports. Take golf for example. You have 150 players in every tournament and only 1 person can win. If a player places well throughout a season and even gets a win, that's considered a good season. Tiger Woods didn't win every tournament he played in, yet it was easy to say he was the best because of his consistency. 

""Well there is no RNG in Golf."" 

That's not true! Some players have to play during times of the day where the weather is much less favorable than other's, and yes it does impact how well the do in the tournament. That's just the way she fuckin goes.

All I am saying is if a proper tournament format is implemented, there is not reason a game like this cannot achieve the same level of competitiveness as other ESports. ",FortniteCompetitive

These champ games have 30-40 players at the start of moving zones and we only have 15 games to play. If you don’t get movement for late game you’re screwed on points unless you get kill points which can be very 50/50 against these top tier players. But since placement points start at top 5, it gives a lot of players the incentive to w key going for kill points often causing both parties to die in the long run. I think the point system should be 1 point at top ten, 1 point at top 5 and 3 points for the win because that way you get rewarded for making it to end game rather than wasting 20 minutes and 1/15 of your games on 6th place with 3 kills and 0 points.

Aim assist and damage per second,"We have all seen that FPS affects both Damage per Second and Aim Assist strength, but how would you go about nerfing/balancing that?

For the dps I never personally never noticed the difference. I would say just make the damage the same no matter how many frames your system runs, but I’m guessing it’s not that simple as it hasn’t been fixed yet unless it was fixed already and I never noticed. Then for aim assist it’s more noticeable from my personal experience. I played from season 1 to season 4 on console, when I switched to pc I had also switched to mouse and keyboard. After playing for months on mouse and keyboard I decided to try controller again on 200 FPS as compared to 60. At first the controller felt like a absolute magnet as compared to mouse and keyboard where my aim felt “free”,  which is why I thought streamers always debated with other controller players as they couldn’t see where the average player was coming from. I only experienced smg and shotgun battles. I didn’t miss any shots, which impressed me, but I usually died early due to forgetting controls so I hadn’t gotten into too many ar long range battles. So my overall experience with the controller was aim assist was op but not really. It was just that initial ads I needed assistance, which was the main point of aim assist, which is what I got and then some. Then when I heard FPS affects aim assist that’s probably why my controller felt like a magnet compared to my past experiences on console, so props to console players, but then comes into question how do you “fix” the aim assist fps correlation? On console, the aim assist strength is perfect especially when going against other console players but then you start thinking, is the pc 200+ FPS aim assist to strong? Personally I think it is but it isn’t when going against pc players it seems needed to have stronger aim assist but then the next thing you have to take into account is the average pc players aim. Yeah mouse is “easier” to aim with but it doesn’t mean everyone has god tier aim. In my opinion it would be best to find a balance for aim assist. I think 200 pulls too much and 60 FPS isn’t enough I feel 120 FPS aim assist strength is the perfect balance and would be best if that strength regardless of FPS was the default strength. Also making it so frames per second doesn’t affect aim assist strength.",FortniteCompetitive

Im a 15 year old high school sophomore, averaged a 4.0 GPA my entire life, and fell in love with fortnite. This game has put me and others through a lot, but I always stuck with the game. I played starting in season 2, where my crappy laptop proved to be incapable. I then learned how to build my own PC, then got all the parts and funds necessary to do so. I always looked to improve in anyway possible, from my hardware  (mouse, monitor, etc) to my play style. Every time I died, I figured out where I had gone wrong, even if it was getting straight bodied by one of the various op items added to the game. 

I saw myself improving. A lot. 

My aim was growing (I had never really played a shooter before this, so I had no experience). My builds were improving, and my game sense was improving. I wanted to figure out how I could make this into a career, by going pro, I felt I was capable. My best chance of doing this was the addition of the ""ranked mode"" with the Valentine's update.

Me and my buddy got 27 points in the duo, putting us directly into the top division. Now I stand here today, after finishing my second session, almost hopeless. This was the second opportunity for me to play becuase of my conflicting schedule. We got barely anywhere, we had 3 points our fourth game, but proceeded to not get a single point the rest of the tourney.

 We would die off spawn, get split up, and about halfway through, my duos dad (who plays in his living room) started blaring music, making everything even harder to hear. It felt like everything was against us. The worst part about all this was when I reflected on why I lost, I could only see ""I got triple teamed endgame"" ""I got an infantry rifle off spawn and the other dude got a pump and full shield"" ""I literally couldn't hear a single thing"". All things that I couldn't affect, not my positioning or my drop choice or anything.

We only have one other time to make it into finals, and that is tomorrow.  If things keep going the way they are going, then ggs I guess.

I've sacrificed sleep, studies, activity (I'm not very over weight/out of shape tho), and my time with family all for this game. This feels like it's too much work with too little gain. This game is starting to die, and people are moving on. I know I'm not performing as well as i can in school, which makes me upset.

I feel lost and hopeless with this game, and overall just think I should give up on it, and go full time school and self improvement.

However at this point everyone should have realized that no console player is going to be a pro without changing to PC and giving any hope for us console guys to compete against them is just a waste of time.

That being said I don't wanna be the best player in the world and I can only speak for myself but I would just love to see how I compare against other people with similar platform as me.

After playing with the hoverboards for some days I can't really say anything negative about them.

So the rumor is that Tfue and Cloackzy will not be attending ESL Katowice. This is not officially confirmed by Tfue, Cloakzy or FaZe, so it is not sure yet that they won't attend. However, they have previously talked about this on stream, and about not attending events because of a financial aspect. This happened with Secret Skirmish, where they did say they would not attend, but they attended anyways.

The whole Tfue and Cloakzy situation is based around financial situation and whether or whether not it is financially beneficial for Tfue and Cloakzy to attend a LAN in Poland. 

We understand them for a content creator view, here is what we think about the entire situation, we will go through it below, and come with a set of pros and cons.

First of all, from a content creator perspective, yes we see that they could possibly lose some revenue in terms of subscribers and donations. However, this event allows people to stream their point of view, and of course, they can not interact with their viewers as much, but will people still watch them? Most likely. Will they be able to watch host a viewing party at home, and get a lot of views too? Yes, definitely, but it is unsure to predict which one will attract more viewers. Even from a content creator perspective, with their lost revenue this could be a great way to grow other social media by creating vlogs in Poland, and whilst still having the ability to compete.

Second of all, most of their fame is from Fortnite, it is like other sports. Yes, you earn more money from the surrounding factors such as sponsorships, stream etc. Just like in regular sports, their contract is often very lucrative, but a portion of their income is also being generated from surrounding factors, such as sponsorships and brand deals. So it is similar, but the thing from sports is that the brand deals comes from their capabilities within their sports.   
So their fame comes from them being good players who are considered the best by some and by their previously accomplishment in the industry.   
Perhaps they will even lose some viewers if they are not considered the best anymore?

We have no idea the reason why they will not attend, but if the reason for them not wanting to compete is financial, then they are not professional players, but content creators. Content creators who are very skilled at the game, but nonetheless content creators who care more about creating good content, which they could also create in Poland if they wanted too. But this is a choice we must respect if so, if their passion is to create content, then we must respect that because they attract a lot of viewers by doing so and are entertaining a lot of people.

If a duo is invited to what can be considered as the most competitive event that has been in Fortnite and chooses to decline it because of financial reason. Here we are talking about streamers who are financially stable and set for the next decade at least. If they do not want to compete in the best event, they should not be considered as pro players. The amount of money they lose is not significant for them, yes they will lose a few days revenue, but their subs will come back. It is all about the mindset and attitude, they do not want to compete at the highest level, they would rather be content creators which is more than fine. 

Another reason could be the lack of trust in Fortnite as an Esport, if they do not believe it will succeed as an Esport, they will most likely choose the path as Content Creators to secure their own future, which is also a great move by them, they can continue to do what they love. 

Another reason could be that they come to Poland, and can only do two things, win or lose. Lose will be seen as a failure for them and many of their fans, this could also mean that they could be afraid to attend the event, with the expectations being set so high for them

Before trying to protect them, read the article, we are not attacking them, there is nothing wrong with being a Content Creator, they most likely have a career that lasts longer than most of the current Fortnite players, and it is their choice.

Now i have more time and am picking up (preparing for a great team i will be coaching next year) on writing abstract theories out so i and you guys can use them to improve yourself or others. 
 
This post will be focused on competitive games/fortnight, Cause competition is the essence of a sport/game. No matter the level of play, u first have to get out there. In a place were its only winning our losing with players within your own level of skill.
In a competitive environment the result you get is a mixture of inputs (opponents) and a player is only partially in control to get the result that he wants. As a mental aspect this is problematic, because players can’t help to feel responsible for the result that their getting. They also get judged on that result by their peers, the competition and themselves. And when the results get more important, the lack of control can express itself as pressure to perform.
Pressure to perform can be scary but is not negative in itself. It indicates that there is something on the line (Money, feelings, dreams or ambitions), and that there is a chance to realize that possibility. Like Michael Jordan once said; pressure is nothing more than the shadow of great possibility.
Individual skills to cope with performance pressure is an essential part of succeeding in a competitive environment. Mental skills are a basic tool to perform, a lot of people know this. But in reality not many players will (no matter the level of play) mostly focus improving on their skills and game knowledge. We mostly know how to use mental skills (I need to stay calm, keep my focus and never give up), but there is a difference between knowing something and doing something. If you have the ability to do something you also have to do it at the right moment. Don’t expect to always use mental tools in the right way or the right moment. Cause from time to time humans mess up all kinds of basic skills. And even if you are mentally strong that does not mean you can’t improve.
When you can use developed skills with the right timing, there will be no loss in performance. The skill that you have will come out in its full potential and is called performance potential. In a competitive game, this will be the best of your abilities. Some people believe that they can perform better under pressure, which is simply not true. You can’t do better than you have ever done before. In a training exercise (our pub game/ playground) being convinced you can will result in more pressure and leads to performance loss. Knowing your limitations is important in a competitive situation as is protects you from making mistakes.
Performance = performance potential – performance loss
In a competition it’s nearly impossible to get to your full performance potential. There will always be a bit of performance loss. That a sprinter will defeat his personal record in a final game seems plausible, but after studying the training results in the weeks or days before this final makes it clear that the sprinter was beating his PR already. Additionally, a student could think he is better under pressure as he passed an exam with only a nights of studying. If this student would take the same time and focus, to learn, spread out of the week before his result would be better and healthier because more information would stay after the test.
In a sprinting game or with a simple task there will be less performance loss. In a game where there are a lot of factors, that limit your control, the loss in performance will be a lot bigger. So as a player, you are doing incredibly well if you come close to your performance potential while playing a game of Fortnite.
What makes you choke at the most important time, game or moment is unfortunately impossible. When you are watching a streamer in a stressful game and notice that he misses a stack materials among the loot shortly after he dies because he lacks materials it seems strange. But this happens and is a really hard to figure out exactly why this happens. It has multiple reasons, and that’s great. Otherwise one would feel really dumb for choking and not preventing it. It is makes sport/ games fun and unpredictable to watch and or play, anything can happen and wins are sometimes a result of an enemy’s choking.
Now I will discus 5 complementary perspectives on performance that can help you fulfill your performance potential. The most important viewing point and the essence of these perspectives are: control the controllables. Meaning that you only have control of your own input, focus on that.
- Get better at the game and invest in your performance potential. If u want to perform better the first step is to get better. This is a complementary system that requires and eventually results in extra time and concentration. If your mechanics get better you could play a faster game or get more options to reach a goal or advantage. If your game sense gets better your decision-making gets better and enemy players won’t be able to punish you as much and you will have more options to pressure them. Your mental state gets better because you have more control. These 3 points are complementary so it works in all directions. If 1 gets better, through interaction the other 2 will benefit from this. If one gets worst, it drags the other 2 down as well. (for example, if one stopped playing for a while and returned your mechanics will be worse which could influence your mental state resulting in making stupid decisions ,game sense wise, which lead will lead to more stressful situations and thus further influence your mechanics, until it spirals out of control and you rage quit.
- Performance pressure. If you play in a completion that has personal significance for you, most of the time there will be a physical reaction. This is mostly caused by evolution and it helped humans survive. A higher heart rate, sweating etc. this physical reaction or arousal make us physically ready for the action that is to come which makes it part of the game. Pin most cases players will interpret this excitement in a negative sense and create negative effects. The most important thing here is that its normal. So interpret it as normal. Your body being ready for action is there to help you reach your objective. The moment is important for you and there is something on the line. It’s great that you can have a physical reaction because it will help you to thrive in stressful situation. If you feel the excitement in a game, know that you are ready. You don’t have control over winning only over your actions. Try to focus on that instead of focusing on the excitement.
- If you can’t keep your arousal in check there are some things that can help u get there.
o Focus on breathing in a normal pace, and relax.
o Have routines before playing and sticking to them.
o Visualize the actions and tasks in situations in the game you are about to play
These skills are good to know and learn. Even positive excitement can hinder your form and prevent reaching your performance potential. Your heart rate should be higher in the loading screen than during the game. If you focus on a task your body will adapt. And your arousal will fit to your task, so if u focus on your arousal your heartbeat will go up and you will feel more aroused. Control the arousal and try not to let your arousal control u. this is a game within a game and like a game u don’t always do what u want. In the next point I try to make this more clear.
- Negative thinking. It’s impossible to not think negatively from time to time. And putting the thought away is not always an option. Like the elephant analogy, if you try not to think about an elephant you will probably think about an elephant. If u really don’t want to think negatively you will think badly about you thinking negatively which makes it impossible to not think negatively. So let your thoughts be, like your excitement. Try to focus on the task at hand and your body and mind will follow . Negative or positive thoughts and excitement will come up from time to time, however. thoughts are not constant or permanent. So if a negative thought comes up, register that you have a thought without judgment and try to move on and refocus. If you are really struggling with this in your life or during a game. Ask for help, because talking to somebody about this helps and if u do it with a professional it can make a lot of differences in your game and in life.
- Refocusing on your task. In a game where so much can happen, in life or during a crisis situation. It's impossible to focus for the whole duration, you will lose focus from time to time. It's not the ability to focus that makes a difference, it’s the ability to refocus yourself time and time again. No matter the situation, focus on your task. In all this u have not all the control over the situation, humans no gods. So don’t try to feel like you should control everything. It’s really hard sometimes but saying or thinking you have no control is also incorrect. You have control over what you do and a bit in how you do it. So try to use every ounce you have got to do as much as you can. And the more you do that the more you will get out of the potential of that situation.
That’s why controlling the controllables is key. You can’t control what you can’t control. Thinking about the past, the weather, the fps, bugs or the input-lag will not improve your performance. If you are doing this, are tilting or confronting yourself with failure and are not on the level that you want to be, think about the bigger picture and your core values. These are there to shape the path that you want to be on. Do you want to perform at your max performance potential? go for it with all u got. You won’t feel regret if u do things that are important to you. So what are u risking? Feelings, thoughts and situations change over time, nothing is forever and going all out is the most fun u can have in your live (except when doing drugs/dangerous things, be careful in those cases). Fear regret, and don’t fear putting yourself out there, improving and vulnerability are close together and make you feel alive.
At last: winning or losing is not the thing that matters in games, don’t play if you only want to win because there are a lot more losers than winners (especially in fortnite). Set goals for yourself based on your performance. For example, if you want to win a game, try to survive as long as possible. If you get close you have reached your goal and the next time you will feel good if you performed better. And if you do it to the fullest of your potential but the competition was better, you still gave it your all. So after a while you can think or feel positive about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not the best player, but I think I can contribute something valuable to this sub. We are talking a lot about mechanical skills and strategies in here and its all super important. Nevertheless I have played semiprofessional poker before, where Mindset was a big big thing and you had to train very hard to always make the best decisions even tho RNG was super unfair to you right now. Trust me its nothing compared to what happens in fortnite. You can play a poker tournament for 8 hours straight perfect and get a bad RNG situation (or bad cards dealt in live poker)  and you go home as a looser. If you have multiple tables open that shall never affect your decisions on the other table which is a skill to train, by realizing which mental factors come in play and why you tend to take more risk after getting a bad beat.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see similar situations in my own game and when I'm spectating others.  I started to collect them, but it's not complete. The goal should be to raise awareness why we made specific decisions ingame and increase the chance to make better decisions later. So now enough talk I try to summarize some leaks here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Peeking too long when the first shot misses. - When giving AR shots I feel we (of course not everyone) tend to peek longer when we miss our shots. This is due to our ego hurt. We think ""I must hit this shot"" and want to prove that we hit our shots. That leads to a worse decision in the end when we peek to long.
2. Greed for the Kill - Very often we assume that opponent has less health than he actually has. Very often there is time for a mini or a slurp in a fight. Even if they are really low and we are full we very often expose our self for a full shotgun shot to give him the last 30 damage. I mean it gets a bit better when we get 50 health back, but still very often the greed  can make us loose a fight or taking unnecessary damage.
3. Proving to your teammate squad member - This is all for a competitive environment of course in a pub squad match we can feel free to have fun. But I definitely think that a lot of people ask wayyyy less for help than they should, probably they want to prove their teammate that they are good. You don't wanna die in a 2 vs 1 situations. Even if your opponent has 10 life and you are full you should communicate your partner that you have a fight and he should be close to save you for the 5% you might loose the fight.
4. Similar to 1. When missing shotguns shots I also feel I expose myself more than when I'm hitting my shotguns shot which is actually bullshit, this is again my ego, that wants to prove myself I can hit the shot. Staying calm and maybe reset the fight is the way to go if you missed the easy shot.
5. Complaining/Whining. This is so big in the gaming community even amongst pros that no one even really considers the downsides of it. But being in unfair situations and making the best out of it is as much part of the game as playing calm with your godlike loot. Everytime you waste your energy and time to complain and whine you could way better use that to find solutions out. This is just limiting your learning process. Here meditation helps. Just accept whatever situation it was and ask yourself questions. Do I really have to take the 50:50 chance on the chest or could I have gone to another loot? Was my landing maybe not perfect. Might it be better to land on a tac than on a shotgun? Shall I even hot drop? It's super weird how long people can make stupid decisions when they have a way to justify that they aren't delivering.
6. This one is actually not the same topic, but its more a habit, but the callouts of most people just suck. Most players do barely talk while fighting which is a massive disadvantage. I know players way better than me making the same or less amount of points in the pop duo, because their communication sucks. Communication is in duo more important than skill. Part of it is also a positive environment. Only talk ingame about what is important know. Discussions should be after the game. Actually I think one guy should make the decisions and after you guys talk about it. Discussions means hesitation which is very often worse than one or the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to add topics how our mindset is holding us back. I can add with credz.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope somepeople find something valuable in here. A big big tip to improve is definitely meditation. Meditation and Acceptance changed my life

This pretty much ruined the entire share the love event for me because i had consistently maintained high ground 80% of the time but was dying in 80% of my engagements in contenders division.

Champs is.... a different animal.

If I’m being completely honest, I played really bad. Editing was slow, missed shots, building was off, etc. I’m gonna attribute that to not properly warming up, and only having three hours to sleep the night prior.

I don’t want y’all to think I just didn’t do anything though. Multiple games I was 11-17th with two kills, and I just could pull through. I won 80-90% of my early and midgame engagements, but just failed late-game. My mind felt sluggish and I wasn’t keeping pace with the action around me. I played really reactive instead proactive in a lot of situations.

Some things I learned:

-Mistakes are obviously more severely punished.  Expect that if you make a risky play and don’t pull it off, you’re going to eat shit from it.

-Playing patiently is rewarded. Y’all may think it’s just raw mechanical fights, but it isn’t. It’s fucken chess every fight until end-game. Play these fights like you’re trying to conserve health, and materials. When I’d lose highground, I’d sit it out and be a snake on low-ground. Often times players would get impatient, and drop down giving me an opening.

-There’s WAY less w-keying, but it still exists. It’s different here. Every endgame is at least 30 left. Playing placement still seems to be the play, but you have to be willing to dynamically shift your strategy if you get a guy to whites and already have two kills. 

-Utility is more important. Start getting more creative with your loadout. Utility creates openings and pressure. 

-It’s EXTREMELY important to get the most use out of your mobility. This seems obvious, but I mistimed, or poorly used a few items tonight that prevented me from putting myself in a better position for end-game.

-Egos still exist. I feel this is important for me to bring up... There are players that get pissed if you tag them and will hound you back the entire time. You have to learn to appropriately “check” their ego without always full-sending on them. 

-This wasn’t a problem for me tonight, but I’ll address it. Remember not to get shook. Keep your head in the present moment. Don’t think about who you’re fighting, or could be fighting. There’s a ton of big names in these lobbies, you can’t let that consume you.

-I also learned there are fucks that will sit on super villain/Viking and literally poke at you the entire time at Snobby. Like, they’re relentless. It’s super annoying.


Lastly, I’m not super torn up about this. I knew this would be a different pacing and play style. I also knew it was likely I was going to struggle. I’ll be alright. If anything, I’m more disappointed I didn’t play at my maximum potential tonight. My goal here is to not take myself so seriously. I can successfully say I giggled at how fucken bad I was tonight. Last time I took things too seriously I was in a bad headspace on FN for a month. Live and learn.

If y’all have any questions for me let me know. And, also let me know if you want me to update you on the next performance as well, or if I’m annoying you. I don’t mind telling y’all when I play like a potato. This is literally the first time I’ve played in such stacked lobbies as this (not in praccord) and it’s really refreshing. Oddly, it was really fucken fun. I’ve got a lot to learn, and I don’t mind sharing that with y’all along my journey.

Now onto the other shotgun. ""Wait other shotgun?"" Yes there is another shotgun, and that is the Tactical. It consistently does 40-60 to the body, and maybe a little over a hundred to the head. The pump is very strong because of its high burst damage, and the ability to switch to another gun, like an smg to quickly dps a person down. A tac, not so much. It does little damage a shot, and If you do manage to get a headshot which after all, is not rare because of its huge retical, you won't kill them unless they do not have shield. Here is a solution:

Buff the tactical body shot damage. Simple as that, buffing its body damage allows for more burst damage. Im not saying minimally buff it either, we need true contenders to the forever standing Pump shotgun. A 20+ damage increase will do it justice, and People will have a hard time choosing a pump for its one shot potential, or the tac's high dps.

Here is the Controversial Part.

Reintroduce the heavy shotgun, but make its rarities Uncommon and Rare. After that, make the Pump an Epic and Legendary. This change makes it so that Pumps are not the only weapon people use, but a weapon that is highly sought after. The heavy will have its role as a beginning game weapon, while the Pump and Tac will be competing for the main shotgun role.

Now you might be saying, why would you switch up the rarities? The Pump is currently a weapon used in everyone's loadouts. The Heavy does not have a role, that's it was taken out. This will give the shotgun meta a refresher, and most importantly every shotgun a role to play.


TL;DR: Give The Tactical Shotgun a big buff, add back the heavy as a Uncommon and Rare, and Move the Pump to Epic and Legendary.",FortniteCompetitive

So I've been steadily improving by making better decisions, building better, and hitting more shots. I can actually build battle and at least compete with about 90% of the people I run into online.
 
I keep dying in situations where I land a good first shot on my opponent and they build themselves in and hold left click when I try to break their builds. After the change that decreased the delay between turbo builds, I just have no idea how to deal with this scenario. I try to smg my way in and they're able to keep putting up pieces. I try to pickaxe and take a wall (which I've been successful in doing before the turbo build buff) and there's just no way I can break their wall, switch to my wall, and put it down before they're able to replace their wall by just holding left click. It basically just turns into a waiting game. I wait for an edit and then it's a toss up on who gets the better pump shot. Or while I'm waiting I get third partied, which happens a ton.
 
Can anyone offer advice on how to deal with this? For me this situation where I think I have a really good player just turns into a waiting game or they get the advantage because they can decide how they're going to try and edit me. Do I need to box up myself? I just find that it completely destroys the flow of my game and makes getting the kill extremely annoying. I just wanted to know if there was a strategy for dealing with this, because I find it hard to believe players can be rewarded so much for holding left click. I feel like I must be missing something.
 
Thanks in advance",FortniteCompetitive

**Personal background**: I'm in my mid-twenties. I have a full-time job (and a girlfriend…yikes). Fortnite is the first video game that has brought back my addiction since high-school (love the game).  

I cannot get on board with Pop-Up Cups / tournaments lasting 5 hours whilst trying to have a life. The 3 hours cups for the qualifiers of the Share the Love event were do-able for me. I could get off work, and play from 6 to 9 PM, or find a slot during the weekend to play during the day. 5 hours is simply too much. I can’t sleep after the event because I’m so wired and then I wouldn’t be able carry myself as needed in my work the next day. Weekends are often spend socializing or relaxing, but 5 hours from 6 PM to 11 PM on a Friday cut into dinner with a significant other, or any form of showing face to friends. I would love if there were options for morning events on Saturday/Sunday from say 9 AM to Noon.  

**Feedback**:   

Option 1. Implement Pop-Up Cups in more frequencies for shorter durations (2-3 pop-up’s per day for 3 hours). This allows those of us with other obligations to continue to play into our competitive instincts that Fortnite allows us to satisfy.  
Option 2. Implement full-time ranked system that allows for players to participate as time permits them, enabling them to grind towards certain ranks/points to see how they rank against the competition.  

I know most of this has already been said, but I thought I could reverberate it again. Any other constructive feedback is always appreciated.

Hey all,

Just wanted to give some feedback and opinions on the current state of Fortnite competitive gameplay. Let’s be honest, right now it is a complete joke. Epic started this ‘Share The Love’ with placement style games with providing very little to no information on how placement seats were determined. It was arguably easier to qualify for Champion Division in the placement rounds than it is to play up through each division, Especially going through Contender. For instance, I myself get around 35- 45 points in each pop-up cup. My highest score in Contender thus far has been 18 points. I am not complaining about the level of difficulty to get into Champion division. I am just pointing out that the current system is flawed.

Currently, Epic has implemented these competitive matches to certain days. They allow people in higher divisions to play in lower divisions. For instance, my friend qualified for Champions, and has achieved 13 points. He literally sat in queue for over 45 minutes looking for a game until he finally gave up and played open division. How can this be allowed? When implementing a competitive game style, Epic needs to consider all players across the entire skill spectrum. Why is it possible for people to play down in divisions? This only frustrates lower skilled players and sends them the wrong message. They are literally in the lowest division possible getting absolutely destroyed by Contender and Champion division players. In their mind they might just assume the players they are getting annihilated by are qualified for Open division as well which can only frustrate and discourage players.

I also want to address the scheduling and set games you can play each day. I do not understand why each ‘Share the Love’ event is pre-determined by specific dates and times. Say a player missed the qualifiers and happens to miss one of the five potential game slots. How does that player have a “fair”  chance against other players? Sure, the common argument is “well if you are good enough, 4 days in 4 divisions will get you into champion division no problem”. I agree, however very few players are “good enough” to accomplish this.

What I think needs to happen (I welcome your criticism and thoughts) is this:

**1.** **Epic needs to ditch the set dates for each competitive match**.

They need to open this up for a longer period of time. Ideally the entire season. Alternate the game types (Solo,Duo,Squads) every few days giving players a wide variety to choose from. This will be far more flexible for causal players who want to test their skills on a daily basis. 

**2.** **Divisions and ranking**

This in my opinion is extremely flawed right now. I have played competitively in several games over the past years from World of Warcraft to League of Legends. The League of Legends soloque model is ideal (Other than ELO Hell) and can easily be implemented into Fortnite. For instance, lets say we keep the 4 divisions we have now. Open, Prospect, Contender, Champion. Based on your placement games (discussed below) you will be placed in a certain division at zero points. Each division should be separate based on the game mode (Solo, Duos, Squads). So lets say for instance you place in the Open division. You start at 0 points and in order to qualify for Prospect you must achieve 100 points. With the current state of competitive, players are forced to camp to endgame due to the limited number of games they can play. In Contender for example you need 25 points in 15 games. It is very difficult as a few bad games can completely ruin your chances. Instead, give players more incentive to win. Allocate far more points for placement. By doing this, the scrim play style will still be used. A general idea would be something like this:

Solo

Win: 5 points

Top 3: 3 points

Top 5: 2 points

This may be a bit dramatic but you get the point. By winning games, and getting the maximum amount of kills, you can get upwards of 10 points each game which gives players incentive to play skirmish style rather than “w-keying”. As players can play as many games as they want in each division, they can progressively get better and rank up. I absolutely can not stand the fact that right now you basically need to be playing your absolute best in a 5 hour window to even have a chance of getting to the next division. 

Another ranking mechanic is the concept of losing points. Lets say you finish below the top 50 in a game without any kills, - 5 points. This will keep players on edge, However it might enable a massive camp fest where everyone just hides and rarely drops into hot areas to avoid losing any points. Again, I am not saying this is in anyway perfect, I welcome your thoughts and concerns.

**3.** **Matchmaking**

Matchmaking against other players needs to be based on your division. Epic can not allow players from higher divisions to play against lower leveled players. The only instance I can think of which may interfere with this Is playing with friends at different skill levels. This can be allowed however it needs to be balanced. If a Contender division player wants to play with his/her friend who happens to be in Open division, they must play against players in Prospect division. My thinking is this; essentially take a weighted average between the two players or four for squads and allocated higher weights to the higher placed players. So instead of a Contender and Open players matchmaking against Prospect players, they will play against the upper tier Prospect players (Players who are over 70+). Or just do not allow Matchmaking outside your division at all until you get into the 90+ point region of that division. Once a player achieves around 90 points in Open division, they can start playing against players in Prospect division. This will test skill levels as it gives a each player a taste of that the higher division is like and ultimately answers the question – can I play against these players in the next division?

**4.** **Placement**

Placement games should be given to each player, regardless of when they decide to start playing competitive. These placement games (perhaps 5-10 ?) will determine which bracket you place in. Say you win game 1, your game 2 will be against similar skill leveled players. Some of these players may already be ranked depending on when you start. They main concept here is to put a cap on placement. It does not matter if you win all of your placement games with maximum kills each game. The highest division anyone can place is Contender. This will eliminate the RNG factor of Champion placement issues which many of us have noticed and have been complaining about (I saw one Reddit user post that he got into Champion division with 14 points form placement, I myself got 18 in the same region and placed Contender). By doing this, you can concentrate the competition into 3 divisions at the start of the season which will balance on its own over time. Pro players will work their way into champion division where as players with less skill who made it into Contender after their placement games will most likely stay there, and will have to work hard throughout the season to achieve Champion division. The dilemma here is that Contender division at first will be extremely difficult yes, but the main goal is to have balanced and appropriate divisions for mid-end season.

**5.** **Tournaments**

Time and time again, I hear about how much money Fortnite is giving away in cash prizes for pro players. Most of the time these players are streamers who are indeed pros. However, if a player is not a well known streamer, the only way for them to get invited to these tournaments is usually based on a “pop-up” style event. I did really enjoy the pop-up cups however they do not give an accurate representation of skill. A player can have a bad day resulting in them not being able to qualify for the tournament. In some cases, players have dropped out of tournaments and random players – some I have never heard of, get invited. 90% of these players do deserve to be there, however in some highlight clips I have questioned the skill level of some players invited. By implementing a season long competitive game mode, Epic can clearly see who the best players are, as can everyone else playing. By making this division, you as a player can be on the immediate invite list for tournaments. By averaging out your skill over a longer period of time, rather than these weekend qualifying events, players can show a more accurate skill level and the pros can truly stand out.

**Thanks for reading, hope to hear thoughts and concerns.**

On another note, I find it absurd that younger players are not allowed to compete in tournaments. I came across these 14 year olds from Europe; Mrsavagem and Mongraal who are absolutely insane. They will definitely give North America pro players a run for their money. Epic needs to allow younger players to compete. Who knows if Fortnite will even alive in 2 years when they come of age to play. ",FortniteCompetitive

The problem is that for the last 5 or 6 months my grades have dropped a lot, i used to average 13-14s/20 on my report cards and now i am getting 11-12s/20 and consequently my parents only allowed me to play on weekends. Furthermore, i am in the middle east and internet here is pretty shit plus i play on eu servers so i average about 120+ ping with about 1-2% packet loss. Despite of that i still consider myself really good while playing around only  12-15 hours a week while i could be playing around 35 in a week with actual good ping.

Here are my options:
A.
Focus on school, study hard and try to get my grades back up (15-17) to a point where my parents are happy and see that i am doing well academically so that they MIGHT allow me to play during the week.
And, if my grades are high enough they might help me out with internet( it’s really hard to get good internet but with the right connections it is possible and many of my friends do get good ping but my parents cba to help out since they barely use it anyway)

B.
Just give up this whole pursuit and try to find another passion and dream to follow, one that is more down to earth and possible in my current conditions.

I am in desperate need of advice, i do not know what to do and i have been pretty depressed and unhappy these past few months due to this issue as i feel i have no control over my life conditions.

I'm a controller on console player and I was placed in Oceania Champion division (unexpectedly). I only got 16 points in my first solo placement session and didn't bother playing the rest, since I already had a pin. I played the last three sessions, the first session I played for four and a half hours, after which I was 'matchmaking' for over 30 minutes, I consistently placed top 20 in almost all matches from my first session, often I would make it to 11th placement and die, a couple times I made it to either 6th or 7th place, yet after four and a half hours I was only able to get 2 points, I don't think this represents how I played at all, and with only 2 points I was in the top 42% of 1000 players in that division? Is there anybody else here that plays Controller **on Console** in any regions of the champion div? If I could afford a PC to use my controller with, I would, but a good controller on console player versus good controller on PC players or good kb&amp;m players, is definitely a disadvantage in almost any sense. I honestly don't mind playing against PC players in these sessions but the point system is terrible. Let me know if I'm just complaining because I'm bad or if it's valid",FortniteCompetitive

For a week I tried stretched res and it was working perfectly fine with more than average fps and greatly improved my aim and building but after a while it started to lag more, and one reason I assume is the problem is my graphics card being only 50% usage and my cpu is around 27%-34%, I've tried to raise the performance but its allready at maximum, tried even overclocking and finally I reinstalled my drivers and nothings working out. I benchmarked my computer and its normal so I don't have any ideas. So I was wondering if anyone else had this problem or might have ideas to fix it.

The problem it's so hard to get to late game as people take fights even if the zone is moving, and mostly it's hard for me to see people while 1st zone is moving since they lasser hit like for 100 hp and then rush you and spend the whole next 5 minutes try to kill you inside your 1 x 1 when you try to heal or if you have a mobility item you can run away however he will still follow you,

Anyways, he killed off the 3rd to last player so I push him push him.Im over here super confident because when I push him, I get an 86 damage pump shot in a build battle.

He drops down and I stay up, he hit me too, so I heal up. While healing, I hear him build up, or at least try to. I try to build higher but...

I “Harry Potter” myself, and at this point I panic.

I try to get out of my little situation but I’m panicking, I end up accidentally editing a door, open it, and he slips in a rocket for 130+ and I drop down.

I’m over here shitting myself, and I know that he’ll drop down to so I try to build up, and guess what....

I “Harry Potter” myself again.

He drops down, starts spamming his pickaxe to break my wall because I box in,and instead of holding turbo build, I accidentally open up edit which allows him to break/replace the wall, and he edits and shotguns me.

I recommend looking to our BR brothers at PUBG. In battlegrounds there is a mechanic that allows players to disconnect but leaves the character model in game (indefinitely as far as I know). The character can still be interacted with (eliminates). I suggest a similar mechanic be added to fortnite to counter players leaving before being eliminated. I hope that if you see this it will convince you that this is the best solution.

Personally, I feel that competitive fortnite can become mentally straining after 4+ hours and I actually really like the pacing of the (now stacked) pop-ups. It makes me excited when they finally do come out. If a permanent ranked mode was added, I don't think I'd enjoy playing them as much as I do now.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Being in a 1x1 turtle is too strong of a position without many drawbacks. Since the Deagle nerf, being in a turtle has become very difficult to deal with and it is difficult to pursue a kill when a player is turtled. Sure, there are a few tricks you can do to steal a wall, but it is much easier for the guy in the turtle to control the pace of the fight, and a simple wall replace does not by any means equate to a kill on the turtled. Now I'm not saying to bring back the deagle, it is quite clear that it was broken, but maybe adding a slot in the traps section, or even just a weapon with a very distinct sound cue that deals no player damage, is slow/clunky, has a slow reload time, and have its sole use to immediately break one target build would be much more fair and balanced. Kind of similar to a heavy sniper, but as a trap slot of some sort would definitely make it worthwhile.

Planes are still massively overpowered for two reasons. 

1. The turret. Removing this should have been the very first thing they did to the planes. It’s not an issue if you’re fighting them 1v1, but when you’re being 3rd partied and shot at by a plane 100m away there is NOTHING you can do about it without it causing you some sort of problem.

2. It’s a free ticket to end game. This becomes more of a problem in competitive play but the point still stands. Why is there no fuel system? No need to worry about the storm or play tactically in any way, shape or form.

It’s been said one million times over but the introduction of planes to this game has been a complete mess from the start. If they’re to stay in the game they need to be rendered nothing more than a mobility item with a fuel gauge.",FortniteCompetitive

First cup dropped 9, second I would have had 20+ but my points weren’t counting. I changed some things this time around and felt immediate improvements, so I thought I’d share.

1st: Despite what anyone says, play for fucking placement. Playing placement is the most consistent and reliable way to stack points. Your goal every game should be to focus on top ten. Burn your mobility, your mats, etc to get to top ten, then focus on your situation there. I’m telling you to aggressively pursue it. Picking up kills late game is often much easier than picking them up mid-game with third parties. It’s too heavy of a risk/gamble.

2nd: Take 2-5 minute breaks after every game, especially after intense fights / endgames. Often times, I would be in a quick moving late-game and I would carry that momentum over to my next game. I’d be moving too quick, not thinking about the present game, but the previous one. I’d forget to take it slow, and create a plan. These breaks also helped with tilting and allowed me to vent a little. I know it seems silly, but give it a try. I perform at my best when I’m calm, confident, and collected. The moment I start losing a grasp on my calmness, I start missing shots, losing the picture, etc.

3rd: This one is pretty specific to me, but I changed my scrim drop. For the past few months I’d been dropping Paradise and I was comfortable there, many times winning those engagements and getting great loot. However, there were just too many people to deal with in those cups. I found myself dying early game at least 50% of my games and it was infuriating. Changed my drop to something more obscure and it helped massively. I won probably 90% of my early game engagements.

4th: Always chip at people and gather information while in your box end-game. Whenever I had the ammo for it, I was shooting planes down or tagging pilots. I was pressuring people fighting, etc. At the very least, I knew where everyone was around me. I’m seeing A LOT of people avoiding shooting planes end-game. Guys, that’s FREE DAMAGE. If everyone on the ground is saying “fuck the guy in the plane” you’re getting free, uncontested shots at a guy. You may even score a kill.

5th: Play hard to the end and don’t let your mind get you in the dumps. At 12 games I had 12 points. I went 5 games not getting a point bc the point system is scuffed. I was getting tilted, and audibly said “oh it’s impossible now to get 25”. I almost quit for the night, and I even turned my PC off. Ended up getting water and saying “fuck it, this is good practice. Worlds will be announced soon, and we’re going to go through the same shit, so I might as well figure it out now.”

My 13th game I won, putting me at 18 points. I had 15 minutes to play two games. I hot dropped Paradise and picked up 5 kills then quickly left. My last game I won and got 6 points putting me at 26 total. If it’s possible, go for it. Don’t let your mind defeat you. It’s likely you ARENT a shitty player. I was telling myself the same thing after only getting 9 points. 

“Oh a year of playing and I’m ass.” I was just getting harder and harder on myself and it wasn’t helping. Stop that shit when it starts. Be accountable and honest with yourself, but be kind to yourself. Allow yourself room to grow and CHECK your ego.




I’m not writing this because I think I’m a god. I’m writing this bc of how down I was mentally. I realized I was doing it to myself. I also realize this doesn’t mean I’m going to do well in Champs. It’s obviously an entirely different animal, and I’m excited to figure out the rhythm there. I hope this helps some of y’all. There’s a lot of you out there that are amazing at the game, but struggling. Just look at it as another challenge. If y’all have any questions feel free to DM me or comment. I’ll do my best to answer. 

I’ve been in this sub since it’s inception, and a lot of you have shown me support and love when I was going through some personal issues. If I can help y’all with anything, I will. Just ask.

Much love fellas, and good luck.

# Full Standings

First, I calculated the standings of all the players. I believe that this was shown only for Top 20 and without detail. 

[Full Standings](https://imgur.com/a/CKfZSiJ)

First thing to note is that Saf has more kills and a better avg. placement than Bizzle, the winner. Had Saf gotten 1 more point, he would've won. Just shows how clutch Bizzle's second win was. 
Highest placing EU player: Pate1k (6th). Highest placing controller player: Flossen (39th). Highest placing free agent: Kyzui (4th). Other notable placings are Nickmercs at 90th and Chap at 89th. Ghost members somehow manages to consistently place next to each other. Sean, Aydan, Kayuun, Dmo and Thwifo ranked 63, 64, 66, 67, and 68th, respectively. XXIF and TriggySoars completely tied, so I flipped a coin to decide who gets 59th. XXIF won.

[Top 10 Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/LzgFqTO)

[Bottom 10 Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/MjzVQ5M)


Overall, Saf has the best average placement, averaging 14th place. His landing spot was the oasis close to Westworld. Nickmers had the worst, averaging 89th. He dropped Shifty Shafts rather than Tilted for this entire series, and died to Tocata 3 times early game. Nickmercs, Chap, Slobings, Aydan, and Overpeek never made it past the 2nd circle.

Also, notice how low average placement is not a good indicator of how well you'll place in this format. We will try to fix this by applying another format to the results in a later section.

[Top 10 Most Kills](https://imgur.com/jmR7dO3)

Saf wins this category with 20 total kills. Only 3 players did not get a single kill (Lyricen, Overpeek and Dark). 

Notice how 9 of the top 10 killers make it to Top 10 overall. This implies that total kills are a good indicator of how well you'll place in this format.

# Playstyles

We can try to infer the playstyles of the top 20 Players by looking at how their kills are distributed across early, mid, and late-game. In the following graph, black dots represent kills and red dots represent deaths. Each box represents the distribution of kills across storm phases for each player.

[Distribution of Kills across Storm Phases for Top 20 Players](https://imgur.com/X3FNzS6)

Bizzle (17 kills) and Saf (20 kills) consistenly made it to end game and were actively getting kills during all phases of the game. Vivid (17 kills) suffered from 2 early/mid game deaths, putting him behind Saf and Bizzle. Just goes to show the importance of being strong in all 3 phases of the game consistently. 

For example, Vinny1x (5 kills) played purely for late game, with 0 early game kills and 5 total kills overall. His strong late game put him on the board, but it wasn't enough to get top 10.

On the other hand, roatdw had the strongest early game. 9 of his kills were before 3rd circle. He was able to get 18th without a single placement point and only made it to late game once (anyone know where he landed?). As we can see, roatdw's strong early game singlehandely put him in Top 20, but his early deaths prevented him from placing top 10.

Pate1k (16 kills) also went for a lot of early game kills, but, unlike roatdw, managed to survive long enough to get a couple of mid and late-game kills, placing him in 6th place overall.

Vicaros (8 kills) died 4 times in early game without scoring a single point, but his top 3 7-kill game was enough to put him on the board. As they say, all it takes is one game. 

The same could be said about 72hrs (13th). He only made it to top 10 once, the game he won, and didn't do so well for the rest of the tournament.


# Point System

Recently, there's been a lot of criticism of the current point system. I can certainly see why. Many players such as Fulmer, Bowman and Naga Ops did not place despite having more kills and better average placement than many players in Top 20 (Zayt, Blind, Vicaros). They simply did not get their kills in the right order or placed just outside the unforgiving placement point thresholds.

I decided to apply a different point system to the results to see how it would've played out. I applied the point system outlined in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aog6g0/alternative_point_system/), because it seems to be well received. Under this system, every kill is rewarded and more placement points are given. 

&gt; (KILLS \* PLACEMENT FACTOR**) + PLACEMENT POINTS

&gt; Kills: 10 points per kill

&gt;Placements

&gt; 50th - 26th: 10 points

&gt; 25th - 21st: 20 points

&gt; 20th - 16th: 30 points

&gt; 15th - 11th: 40 points

&gt; 10th - 6th: 50 points

&gt; 5th - 2nd: 60 points

&gt; 1st: 80 points

&gt; **Placement Factor:

&gt; 100th - 76th: * 1.5

&gt; 75th - 51st: * 1.5

&gt; 50th - 26th: * 1.6

&gt; 25th - 21st: * 1.6

&gt; 20th - 16th: * 1.7

&gt; 15th - 11th: * 1.7

&gt; 10th - 6th: * 1.8

&gt; 5th - 2nd: * 2.0

&gt; 1st: * 2.5
​

Here are the results:

[Full Standings Under IvoAlbino's Point System](https://imgur.com/a/LleMWQy)

Some obvious observations are Saf at 1st, Tfue at 4th and Psalm at 11th. Zexrow, LeNain, Mmaetoss and Fulmer enter the top 20. LeNain (5 kills, avg. placement: 19) benefitted the most from this format, jumping from 37th to 16th. roatdw, Vicaros, 72hrs and Blind are kicked out of the top 20. roatdw suffered the most out of this format, going from 18th to 36th place. His aggressive playstyle does not work out in this format. 

[Top 10 Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/wXQVuB4)

Notice how avg. placements now becomes a better indicator of how well you'll place in this format. They all make top 20, except Anthony whose great placements are not enough to balance his lack of kills.

[Top 10 Kills](https://imgur.com/DjpIa8l)

Your total kills still remain a great indicator of how high you'll place, but it's less forgiving to players such as roatdw, who don't play the survival game.

# Weapons

[Weapon Distribution](https://imgur.com/8Bxg0ht) (max and min represent max and min distance kill)

#### Fun Facts

- Surprisingly, there was not a single RPG kill, unless somehow RPG counts as a Grenade. 
- roatdw was the player who died to the plane turret. Perhaps, as karma for pushing 72hrs twice with a plane during the pop up cup. 
- Tendons died to InstantEnvironmental?? I don't know what that is, but if I had to guess, it's the storm surge.
- Vinny1x killed himself the most. Died 2 times to FallDamage and once to zone.
- Aspect had the most shotgun kills (11).
- Saf had the most Rifle kills (11).
- Morgausse's only kill was also the farthest kill in the entire tournament (242m pistol kill on Nistic).
- Tfue and Bizzle had the most weapon variety (6 kills with 6 different weapons). 
Bizzle's  weapons: Sniper, Rifle, Shotgun, Smg, FallDamage, Pistol. 
Tfue's weapons: Trap, Shotgun, Rifle, GrenadeLauncher, FallDamage, Smg.
- Poach died twice to Vivid and once to 72hrs.

I also calculated the average kill distance for players with more than 5 kills.

[Highest avg. distance (Kills)](https://imgur.com/mK1PEzy)

[Lowest avg. distance (Kills)](https://imgur.com/7OsukQn)

The data makes sense for players like Bizzle and Tfue who usually play for high ground and third party kills. 

# Storm Phases

[Player count across Storm Phases for each Match](https://imgur.com/KlRFJF0)

Not a lot of interesting info here. The deadliest zone is zone #1. Second deadliest is zone #6. Top 10 usually happens in Zone #7 and Zone #8. In my opinion, it's kind of harsh that a lot of players who make it this far do not get rewarded at all. It takes 20+ minutes to reach Zone #7, yet dying at 11th is equivalent to dying at 100th. 

I wanted to create a graph of player count vs. time, but I was not able to get the time data for all the kills. I tried doing player count vs. storm phase, but it turned out pretty ugly and did not show anything meaningful.

* Awful footsteps and audio q's. Play one game of Apex and see how amazing the audio is. You can hear EXACTLY where someone is, when they're spritining, their direction,  and gunshots too. Fortnite gunshot and footsteps audio is awful.

* Bad gun pool - the current gun pool is awful. Get rid of balloons, nerf plane accuracy, get rid of bottle launchers, get rid of common and uncommon tac, keep blue tac and add purple tac. The gun variety is bad. In Apex both the EVA semi-auto shotgun and the Peacekeeper are pretty well balanced. Peacekeeper is inconsistent in it's damage. Tac is trash in this game and pump prevails.

The way that racing minimizes the RNG or crashing, breaking down, etc. is by scoring the competitors from a week by week basis on a wide variety of variables such as placement, wins, and other little details like leading the most laps in a single race.

Now if competitive fortnite was organized into seasons, maybe 8 weeks long with a LAN event every week, and the overall winner would be decided by the total amount of points gained from the 8 weeks, Each event would still have 6 games at the very least. It would eliminate a lot of RNG. On top of this, solos and duos could be ran simultaneously with these events in their own separate seasons.

Now for qualifying, similar to racing, most people would be qualified for the season based on a placement tournament, but leave spots 95-100 or 45-50 open for the 100 players, or 50 duos who did not make qualification (places 96-195 for solos, 46-95 for duos) to play qualifiers before each event. There would be ways for these people to qualify themselves for the rest of the season by winning.

What is great about this format is that it rewards consistent play rather than 1 and done performances. Also it would allow for rivalries to form for the fans to latch on to. Just like for racing, the race track is not always the same every week, the format does not always have to be the same every week (scoring should stay consistent however). 

If there is some questions or clarifications about the format or something I may have left out, comment and I’ll make sure to respond.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm a relatively average player. 10% win rate and a 2.0 KD in season 7. 

I used to NEVER hot drop. I never liked the idea of decreasing my chances of doing well because I didn't have mats or because my opponent had shield and I didn't. I liked to land somehwere chill so I can loot and get materials and then eventually rotate out and look for some kills

But now I finally feel comfortable hot dropping. A hot Salty or Pleasant doesn't really scare me any more. Obviously there's still gun RNG, but it's nice when I can get shield and a good amount of material and leave my area with 3-5 kills off spawn. My chances now are higher than ever to drop a double digit kill game, something I never would have been able to do before.

My problems don't come early game or mid game any more, they're towards the end of games. 

Closing out games with a W has becomes substantially harder due to the fact that better players are surviving longer and are getting more kills.  Top 10 I'd say about half or more of the players are pretty good or better. 

It used to be kind of rare to get killed in the top 10 by a guy with 10+ kills, but now I feel like it's happening more than it ever has

This is a representation of how many good players there actually are now compared to the amount of good players there were months ago. The general player base is getting much better. 

My only contention is that end games might be ""too hard"" for other players.

Just think about it. Little 11 timmy has 2 lifetime wins. He makes it to top 10 by camping in a 1x1. He looted a gold scar and purple pump and thinks he has a good chance at winning. All of a sudden it's Top 10 and he gets trap killed by a sweaty soccer skin with 13 kills. 

That doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me. I would hate to be a player that is in the same rinse and repeat process every game. End games being more difficult now could deter lesser skilled players away from the game. I mean who wants to play a game that they have little to no chance at winning? I certainly wouldn't

Epic has made this game inclusive for lesser players by keeping big team LTM's in rotation. Maybe it's time to do the same for the higher tier players. Permenant pop up cup? Ranked mode? Something? 

Once again, I'M NOT COMPLAINING. I love these changes, regardless of how it increases the difficulty of winning. They're great changes and make the game a million times more fun.

I'm just looking at it from the other side of the spectrum. I wouldn't want to be the player that lands lonely, farms/loots all game, makes it to top 10 by camping in a bush, all just to get shit on by some kid who thinks he's Tfue. 

I want this game to be fun for EVERYONE, without having to direct traffic over to different LTM's. I want everyone to have fun playing the main playlist is basically what I'm trying to say

However a week in, I am surprised how much it has changed the game. 

Every game after the initial drop all I meet is sweaty try hard bob the builders - which is fun but. 

The incentive for kills are too high, everybody is w keying like morons. Last game we were 3 left and a guy jumps into my box with a RPG, obviously hoping to get the kill a regain his health (the moron ended up killing us both) and a variate of this is happening in every game, in every fight. While the fast pace I great fun, I am missing the strategic element of being good at reading the game and not just putting up builds and having good aim. A solution could be to get the health bonus slowly like a slurpe. 

Farming - everybody past the initial drop is Bob the builder - which means that you need max mats before leaving the drop site. I find myself farming more now than before 7.4 because stone and metal are so hard to come by. A solution could be 700/500/300 mats caps. 

Looting. Pumps are way way way to hard to come by, I often have to loot 2-3 medium sized locations in order to even find a pump, even more to get an ar also. This is a huge problem when you met bob the builder, without a pump you lose. But even more so in the initial drop. The one that get the one pump wins the site. He’ll get the first one shot kill, get shield and mats, be even stronger for the next encounter and so on. Solution, increase the pump spawn rate so that everybody is almost guaranteed to get one. It is so essentially that you are guaranteed to lose without one. 

Let but certainly not least, the skill gap. 7.4 rewards good players to an extent where it is almost impossible for low to medium skilled players to get past the initial drop. However fun it is for the try hards to get easy kills it is not fun for the rest, and what happens if something is not fun - you stop. 7.4 is the best thing to happen to the game, but I can’t see it sustaining a large player base without a ranked mode.

Absolutely think this is a super underrated org that people are overlooking.

Anyways the main purpose of this post was to share my [video application for MRKN Clan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=044vmBY0xTg) publicly on reddit.

You ever just say, draw a picture of someone or something idrk just do anything, and you have it made and you think it looks absolutely perfect, but there’s one thing. In your head it looks to “simple” so you think people might not like it, but people do.

So because you think it’s too simple, you then start drawing maybe earrings. People don’t notice much or care much, but to you, you still think it’s too simple, so you draw on a hat. Then eventually you just start thinking you keep getting the best ideas until eventually your person you drew is flying through space with angel wings shooting rainbows.

Maybe this is a terrible analogy, it probably is but I hope some can see through my point that I feel like S4 was exactly like how Fortnite should’ve been but they just couldn’t stop adding shit without polishing it or thinking about it.

(My advice),"So a lot of people on this sub ask, how do I get better? What exactly do I do? I’m just going to give a short (“short”) list of what helped me take my game to the top level. All these points are equally important so there isn’t a real order to them, if that makes sense.

1.) Comfort. Literally everything. Whatever you’re playing, console, PC, controller, MKB. Make sure you’re comfortable. Do NOT trade this off for optimization however. If you’re on PC, make sure your desk height/chair height are correct. Make sure you have room for your peripherals and stick to it. I made the mistake of poor posture/positioning my first month having a PC. I tried so many solutions but I found what’s right for me. Find what’s right for you.


2.) Flow state. The Flow state is pretty much when you are “in the zone.” Everything seems effortless. What separates good players from great players is who can most consistently be in the flow state. The guys you see pop off in late game scrims all the time? Liquid guys, Tfue, Bizzle, Mitro etc., they are always playing with confidence and effort. People mistake the flowstate for being laser focused and thinking about everything. If anything, it’s the opposite. Obviously focus helps, you don’t want to be zoned out of the game, but you just need to turn your mind off of the little things and just play. If you can channel this state consistently, you will dominate, especially against even skilled or worse competition.


3.) This brings me into a third point similar to the second one. Confidence. Just be confident in your skill. A lot of you guys trying to reach the top level and are barely outside it are probably demotivated or think you’re not good enough. I personally watch the pros and think “hmm I can do that, let me go practice.” Don’t put the best players on some sort of pedestal. I respect all the top tier players’ skill, but let’s be honest, it’s not like they’re geniuses or anything like that.


4.) Staying mentally and physically sharp. No, this isn’t a go life weights tip, but properly hydrating and eating a balanced diet will go a long way. This increases focus and energy, that you can put into the game. Exercise doesn’t hurt either :)


5.) take breaks. When I feel like I’m not playing well, I go drink some water, stretch, hang out with friends, anything. Depending on the situation. If I’m in the middle of a cup I’ll just stretch and chill, maybe eat a little bit, but if I’m getting burnt out or annoyed in pubs, I’ll just go do anything else for a few hours. Sometimes a break gives you a new perspective and positive energy that you need.


6.) learn from the best. Watch what the best players do and emulate it. This is harder for some compared to others but it works like a charm for me. 


7.) Efficient practice. Don’t just go into creative and 90 up for 20 minutes unless you’re specifically working 90s. Chain different building strats together and only repeat one if you need to practice it thoroughly. Yes, Kovaaks helps. I started MKB 3 months ago and my aim for way better once I started using Kovaaks. I wished I did it earlier. Import your exact sens as well for best practice.

8.) play the game. Experience rules all.


I may be forgetting something but that should be a solid start. Thanks for all your guys’ tips on this sub, maybe you can use some of mine :))

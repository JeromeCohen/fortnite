I am one of the early players of Save the World. I do enjoy BR just as much and do not intend to start a comparison on which is better. **Rather, I want to make a comparison between how the two games are treated differently, and why the treatment Save the World is getting is far from justified.**

Save the World is its worst state yet, and that is saying something considering how quickly it started declining in the middle of 2018.

There have been hundreds of posts on r/Fortnite regarding this that have been ignored. Post much better than this, much longer and more detailed.

**Going back to my first bolded point**, I want to make a comparison between how the two games are being handled differently. BR is probably the biggest game out there right now and it makes me so happy to see the Fortnite community expand exponentially within a few months. A BR with building mechanics is brilliant. I am happy for the great game it is, and for Epic, and I understand why the game gets better updates and general development. I completely understand.

It is one thing to slow down development on Save the World, but when you start making changes that are worse for the game, the game starts to die real fast. Epic has made a large number of changes that feel like a PvE competitor made it to sabotage Save the World.

**The number one thing we ask for is proper communication and a little bit of consideration regarding what the community says.** r/Fortnite has gone from a bunch of Epic employees being active on it, to just one, who comments very similar promises everyday, that really do not convince anyone at this point. It hurts to see how quickly the explosives problem was solved in here, whereas changes the entire STW community disagrees on are repeatedly met with either silence or outright rejection. 

We are not told why any of changes were made. Complete silence on this. At this point this isn't slow development. Rather, **it feels like the STW dev team is working on BR 6 days a week, and on the patch day, it mashes up something quickly for STW and releases it without any reason, without any form of testing.** While there are hundreds of passionate STW players writing posts much longer than this one explaining the kind of improvements the game needs, is it hard for Epic to write a single post as a reply? 

**The in-game community Epic is breeding is ridiculously toxic.** People actively make the game hard for others, do not contribute, and have 100% faith in the placebo of a report system Epic has launched. 

This problem was acknoweldged a year ago. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/71dd0q/what_are_we_working_on_for_save_the_world/) 

Quote:

&gt;* First, we ban the serial offenders, then we build game mechanics that encourage all of us to be good to each other. We need to reward players for working together to complete game objectives.

Nothing has been done about this. The report system release around June does not work. The game has become an incredibly frustrating experience, and it is quickly reaching a breaking point.

I've heard and read all kinds of racial and sexual insults passed on teammates, I've seen screenshots of people griefing posted on the subreddit that have been ignored. I've seen the same people doing the same things and ending the chat with ""You know Epic doesn't read reports"" with a smiley. There is no word on this after that, and we continue to get promises of a feature broken in the previous patch being fixed.

Why are the wrong things such as weird UI changes and reskinned Battle Pass heroes at the top of the priority list?

**TL;DR: I am not complaining about content drought and events being copy pasted from last year, or every patch breaking the UI piece by piece. I have learned to make my peace with that, as those problems are showing no indication of improving either. But has Battle Royale kept Epic so busy that it is worth it to create such a toxic environment for a game that such a huge number of kids play? Is it worth it to cut of proper communication with the community?**

Send help. 

Yours sincerely,

a PL 118 player

They're supposed to be Epic rarity for Jonesy's sake! I see these stupid balloons more than I see common grenades, and that's just not right. While people say that ""Epic increased spawn chances because it's new,"" it still shows up WAY too much.

Secondly, it's a waste of an inventory slot (or two or three). Besides people who pick them up to try them out, I don't know if anyone will genuinely use them as a tactic in Fortnite. They just don't work. Plus, you can't combine the packages, so if you have 3 in one slot and 5 in the other, oh well, you don't get 8 balloons!

Finally, they're unnecessary. We have so many other options in the game for mobility, especially now that Glider Redeploy is in the game. You've got rifts, Rift-to-Gos, Quadcrashers, ATKs, shopping carts, Shadow Cubes, Launchpads, Chillers (as mobility), Shockwaves, and probably even more that I'm forgetting.

It's not a terrible game, yet at least, but it's gotten worse than it was. In this post, I will touch on some key points to what I think Epic should do to satisfy players like myself, who have been playing for a long time, enjoy the basic elements of the game, and loved peak Season 3/4, as well as your average casual player who picked up Fortnite start of Season 5, loves the interactive, new elements of the game. 

**Glider Redeployment**

I can't say I agree with this feature, and I feel like without it in the game, nothing was wrong, due to so many rifts, port-a-rifts, vehicles, launchpads, and other mobility items present. However, I do see the positives in it. Consistent rotation, available mobility, etc. But, it can be really easily abused. All it takes is 4 ramps or so built up, glide on into whatever fight you hear happening, and clean up. Then have it happen to you. Which is why I propose maybe a cooldown of 3-5 minutes between redeployment uses. Or maybe a limit on how many redeployments can be used a game. I don't know, this feature just needs to be balanced in some way. There needs to be some risk involved for such a great reward.

**Shotguns**

Personally, I loved the shotgun meta, and am a little mad at all the people who complained about this at the time. However the meta was very very potent, and there was no other option at the time (Hmm, sounds familiar to the shotgun-SMG meta we have today).  Here's my suggestion: Get rid of shotgun cooldown between switching between shotguns. Or at least different shotguns, so we can still do pump-tac or pump-heavy, but no double pump or double heavy. Also get rid of pullout delay for pumps, it's really just an annoying thing at this point. Vault the double-barrel it's been a scuffed weapon since the start. Buff shotguns to what they were originally, 90/95 pumps, etc. If Epic wants, buff the SMGs a little as well. In doing this, we could actually create a balance and a real choice to make in terms of close quarter combat. Shotgun-shotgun or shotgun-SMG or single shotgun or single SMG. Isn't this what Epic said they wanted? Choice to play different styles?

**Revive**

Not sure why they changed the bleedout time from 100 seconds to 50, don't think anyone was complaining about their teammates not dying fast enough, but whatever. I'd like this reverted please.

**Item Shop App**

Personally if they released an app to buy skins on, they would bring in loads more money from the people who may sometimes miss skins due to not being able to be on their system at the time. Sometimes myself I'm out of town, want to give Epic some of my money, and can't because I don't have data to update Fortnite Mobile. Just a suggestion to help everyone out here.

**The Map**

Now I'm not crying, ""Bring Dusty back pleeeeease"", but I do think the map needs to be a little bit simpler. Is all that desert biome really necessary? It was cool for like a one season thing, but do we still need all this? I love paradise, I love that little village place, but could we maybe condense all this closer, shrink the desert area, and overall simplify the environment a little? A little dead space is healthy for the map. I remember going anywhere near Dusty Depot was like walking into a guaranteed warzone, and that's what made it fun. Dusty Depot wasn't about the loot it gave. It was about the openness it provided for warfare that was unique to Fortnite, and you don't see that too much nowadays. There is a place for creativity, but also for simplicity.

**Skins**

Now please don't sue me for this one, but just a thought that if all skins in the game were placed in the item shop, this would balance out a lot of things. It would allow people to buy a skin based off if they liked it or not, rather than if a lot of people had it or not. It also would allow for the purchase of some really neat skins that are not available right now simply because they're ""rare"". Personally I'd love to spend some money on Nog Ops and Ginger Gunner, because I love those two skins for how visually appealing they are. I think the Renegade Raider, Skull Trooper, and Recon Expert are not very good skins, so there would be no reason to buy them. Just thought I'd throw this idea out there, it would certainly help eradicate some of the toxicity in the community, as well as make Epic millions. 

**Conclusion**

On that note, I end it. Honestly leave feedback in the comments, I am curious to see how many people agree or disagree with me on this idea of the game. ",FortNiteBR

To me saying x kills per game is more about play style.

In disco domination however where the mission (has become) just killing 5-10 kills is good.

My kids and their friends believe pulling dubs with 10-20 kill counts is good.
Disco domination your trash if you get less than 20...

Pros: I notice that I average about 2 more kills per game with glider redeploy. It increases mobility a lot so it's easier to find people, both solos and people in fights. That being said my 2 additional kill seem to come from my increased ability to 3rd party fights.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons: Build battles have gone to the next level. People build so far up with no fear of fall damage and it makes engagements a lot more extended because people are able to glide away if they're low. With more extended engagements and increased mobility the problem of 3rd and 4th partying is greatly increased. You don't have much of a chance to reload or heal after skirmishes. It also almost entirely negates the purpose of mobility items (launch pads, shockwaves, etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts: On one hand I have partially enjoyed the increased mobility especially in fortnitemares, where escaping zombies is an issue. But I noticed if I play to win it's much better to avoid engagements late game because you're almost guaranteed to be 3rd partied. I've found my success is greatly increased when I play very conservatively knowing that I can easily glide to the next circle. Personally I think the glider redeploy has completely changed the feel of the game and I don't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to hear your guys thoughts on glider redeploy and start a discussion to give Epic some serious feedback. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

Epic removed the double pump claiming that since it was harder to do it on console (wich is not really) it will be better to remove it from the game. Also they were saying that the newbies did not have a chance when fighting someone who have mastered the double pump..

Now with the smg meta and also the buff of explosives, the newbies have all the weapons they want to be able to stand in front more advanced players, so why can we have a choice to play the double pump meta or smg meta ? They removed the double pump and nerf it so bad so its no longer making damages... With the damages of the actual pump I think double pumping will no longer be OP so there is no reason to not bringing it back.

Looks like the game is getting worst with the new Updates : no more double pump plus buff of smgs = aiming and skills doesnt matter anymore, nerf of materials you can farm = less build fight, glider redeploy = no need for you to learn how to bluid just fly... I dont get it why they making it that way, even if I do understand that they want the game to be accessible for everyone, but if  they want any kid to be able to play without spending some time in learning and getting better so they should avoid getting their game on the e-sport scene...

* Movement is good. I understand why Epic added re-deployable gliders, and I feel like it reduces rotation RNG in a way by giving a more equal chance for everyone to get to the circle safely. But, the way it was implemented had some unintended consequences.

*THE PROBLEMS*: 

1. An increase in time required to finish almost every fight/encounter in a game. I‚Äôve noticed people are jumping off the nearest edge or cliff the second they lose confidence in a fight, and turn it into a game of cat and mouse, or just generally make the fight last longer. This is most prevalent in solos because they don't have a teammate that they want to help stay alive. If you don't believe me that this is nearly every fight now, go tune into any solo streamer and you will see.

2. An increase in 3rd partying and 4th partying etc. I've noticed that people hear gunfire and glide right towards it. This adds additional players into every fight and reduces the amount of time that the survivor can heal or even loot before fighting again because the next players can get there quicker every time. I rarely pick up chug jugs over other heals now for this reason.

3. A decrease in consequences for careless play. You can't punish people for building carelessly high anymore because fall damage is essentially non-existent right now.

*POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS*:

1. Decrease the rarity of launch pads to green and restrict glider usage so you can only pop it freely after using a balloon to gain height. This would be great because you can counter someone's launch pad by blocking it with a roof or destroying it. It requires some skillful input by the person that wants to use movement instead of just pressing jump a couple of times, and allows some possible counters by their opponent (who is most likely trying to prevent them from leaving).

2. Introduce a ""Flight pad"" or some item similar to Chillers. You would place it down, and when affected by it you would get a little pair of glowing wings (or some sort of visual effect) instead of blocks of ice on your feet for a certain amount of time. While you have the effect, you can redeploy your glider whenever you want. This would allow even a full squad to get the effect and glide to safety.

3. Any other ideas? Let me know your opinions on everything I said and how it could be improved.",FortNiteBR

Balloons rarity could be changed to negate RNG, maybe green or blue rarity with a high spawn rate, but it would help balance redeploy as requiring players to use an item slot. It would also make the redeploy mechanic a skill-based mechanic in build fights, as you would have to swap to the balloon, inflate one balloon, and then redeploy in the event that your build gets knocked down.

When you know you‚Äôre going up against some of the best players in the world, the risk/reward of engaging a player/team is vastly unbalanced. Earning one point for killing 3 other players (which at the highest level is extremely difficult) is not nearly as rewarding as it should be. The fact that you could also be 3rd partied is another huge risk, especially with all the new mobility being added to the game. And then to try to kill 4 more for another two points is another possible death wish. And if someone does manage to get that far, there isn‚Äôt any reason for them slay anymore because they‚Äôve capped on points they can earn. Majority of the players only kill when the opportunity is perfect for them, not for the rewards themselves. You can call it smart, but for spectators, it is extremely boring.

My suggestion would be a overhaul to the points system. Scaling up the points system would make it incredibly easier to give out smaller rewards for feats that may not necessarily be deserving of a point on the current system. Also making surviving (and not winning) less rewarding, as it is would entice players to take a more slay-oriented approach to the game.

Solos:

Kills:
1 Kill: 1 Point
3 Kills: 2 Points (Total of 3)
5 Kills: 3 Points (Total of 6)
10 Kills: 4 Points (Total of 10)
11+Kills: 1 Point for every kill after 10

Placement:
Top 10: 2 Points
Top 3: 3 Points (Total of 5)
Victory Royale: 10 Points (Total of 15)

With this set up, players immediate goal will be to fight the first person they see and get their first point. It will also encourage players who are capable of slaying out in games to do just that. It also keeps the Victory Royale a high reward for players aiming to be the last person standing. And if there is someone in the lobby who is capable of tearing through players (10+ kills) he/she definitely deserves to stand at the top (Realistically, if everyone is being aggressive to some degree, I don‚Äôt see this happening). 

This is a lot more confusing than the current scoring system, but let‚Äôs be real, all sports have weird scoring systems. And I‚Äôm sure nobody would have a problem understanding the points system.

TLDR: Change it to the scoring system above and people will choose to fight for points instead of survive for points.",FortNiteBR

This is a good move, however, even Epic knows that too much building and permanent defense can lead to a bad time.

My solution:

Put a cooldown on when the same structure can be built in place of one that was destroyed by an enemy.

Example: If I put a wall up to counter a rocket I should not be able to build a wall in that exact place for 3 seconds. If I wanted I could build stairs or a floor in this place (unless those are destroyed by an enemy as well).

That being said, If *I* destroy something that me or a teammate builds, the cooldown feature does not take place. Only if destroyed by an enemy.

The final storm circle should close in a dome shape instead of how it closes currently (I forgot who suggested this a week or so ago, but credit goes to that redditor). The storm should also break structures while the storm is moving, almost like its decaying. This will help prevent turtling and force people to come and fight in close quarters instead of healing in 1x1s on top of each other. 
2. Introduce another item that will prevent turtling. I get the concept of the 25% rocket damage through walls change was implemented cause watching a pro game with 80 people moving together in the final circle was a bit ridiculous, but the execution of the idea was booty. Maybe introduce another stink bomb type item, like a napalm or a Molotov cocktail that burns through materials quickly and creates a pool of fire/lava around the splash zone?
3. We need a cooldown on the minigun. The gold minigun is frighteningly accurate, and if you have max light ammo in a 1v1 situation, you‚Äôre most likely going to win. Have it cool down at least when it goes through 150-300 bullets. It‚Äôll be much more balanced this way. 
4. Bring back season 4 double pump. Honestly, that‚Äôs when the game was in one of its best states. Pump SMG was always the meta even when double pump was in season 4. This will allow players to run a much more diverse setup. Epic can also slightly increase pump pullout time, or the time it takes to cock the pump and then they can decrease the pullout time for the SMG to balance it better. Maybe vault the double barrel and add a delay if you‚Äôre running two heavy pumps? 
5. Make some changes to the husks/fragments. I think they should keep the corrupted zones in the map (not sure what‚Äôs going to happen on Sunday though) and only have the fragments and husks there. They spawn way too much in fortnitemares IMO.

Since epic wants to stop turtling and we dont want a broken game because of it, 
how about instead of splodes doing damage through walls or turbo building nerfs we add a new mechanic to the pickaxe

###**Proposed change:**

If you hold right click while you have your pickaxe out and break an enemy wall it automatically places a wall for you as long as you have the materials 

If you dont hold right click it acts like normal

###**Advantages of mechanic:**

***No rng:*** instead of having the find wall swap traps you can use this whenever you feel like it

***Level playing field:*** this will essentially negate the ping difference. Another advantage of this is that it really doesnt change the skill gap, sure any default now has the ability to wall swap but the thing is they would never know what to do with it or their edits are slow compared to a better player that will probably get an edit peek off before you noticed in fact this mechanic would probably add to the skill gap because it...

***Has counterplay:*** this mechanic would also increase the skill gap as previously it would be one party turbo building and the other spamming an ar or smg while trying to replace the wall which would make fights last longer than they should, allow you to be third partied, and ultimately come down to who had the better ping and rng

With the change however the attacker will have to think whether its worth it to pull a pickaxe out or to keep spraying their smg in hopes of finishing you off at low hp. This also allows the defender to say... edit a window and shotgun the attacker while he has his pickaxe out instead of being hit by 3-5smg shots or a shotgun blast due to the pullout delay. 

***Doesn‚Äôt break the game:*** finally this solution to turtling wont break the game or make building sluggish( just think about how youll feel having to jitter click to do 90s or ramp rushes ) or be op ( like splodes through builds lol...). It really just equalizes the playing field and makes something that most decent players already do more consistent",FortNiteBR

Epic should have some construstive feedback and mature discussions on balancing so things like penetrating explosive does not happen again.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is a list of **my toughts** about the subject and ideas that I've seen on this sub and /r/FortniteCompetitive. I'm sorry if I don't mention people's ideas, I didn't note who said what. This is a list of ideas, I don't think everything should be implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

# Weapons

* Remove the SINGLE shotgun delay
   * This feels really clunky and shouldn't even be a thing as it was introduced because of double pumping.
   * It would also allow more skillful edit play
* Six Shooter: I feel like the shooting speed is not high enough when aiming
* Ice Traps: Should maybe be changed so it doesn't affect the player using it (still affect team mates).
   * Right now, I've not seen a single good play with ice traps except for mobility reasons where you might want to run faster to the zone. If it didn't affect the player using it, it might have a better impact in a build fight. However, it might be too OP to drop it by stack of 3.
* Increase the drop rate/stack size of stink bombs
   * It's one of the only real counter to turtling besides explosive
* Splash damage for all explosive where you take less damage at the edge of the explosion.
* Better visual cue for grenades, sometimes I have no idea there is a grenade next to me. Am I the only one ?
* I feel like pump should have damage fall-off like AR does
   * It would allow to increase damage output where you hit all your pellets in the chest of the ennemy at a 1meter range, as 80 right now is a bit low imo for a pump in that range
* Pistols: Does anyone really carry a pistol (not a silenced one because those are lit) after early game ? 
   * Maybe less bloom ?

# RNG

I've seen a lot of propositions to counter RNG early-game to mid-game

* Houses are guaranteed to drop at least one weapon
   * This could be the same for tilted buildings for example where you are guaranteed to have a weapon for every two floors, etc.
* Air drops are marked on the map for everyone and are the only source of gold weapons so players fight to have them (I saw this idea from 72hrs, I really like it)
   * This will allow more mid-game fights as people seem to be bored during mid game, it's a risk/reward thing
* More vending machine with buying limitation for shield/healing items so it's not too OP especially in pro-meta where you might just want to buy 15 medkits to survive the zone
   * This would allow well deserved healing after (hard) early game fights
   * If there is for example a vending machine for minis, I think it should be for example wood: 2 minis, brick: 4 minis, metal: 6 minis

# Glider Redeploy

This has a lot of mixed reviews, I personally don't really like it and think it was fine before, but here is some ideas that I've seen to tweak it:

* Have a CD so you can't spam it
* Have a limited use so you have to think when to use it
* Have more than 3 stories high so you can take fall damage
* Don't allow to spam space while using it to be able to be shot more easily, it has to have some downsides to it

# Zone

* Bring it back to 10 for end zones to avoid having 15 medkits heal-offs
* Another idea was to never close the zone and bring it up/down
   * However I think it would have a huge disadvantage for people with no mats as they can't move up/down 
* Another idea was to keep it moving while never closing 
   * Same thing, I think it would have a huge advantage for people with high ground
* Increase zone damage the further away from the edge of the zone you are,
   * It would avoid heal-offs where people stay far away from the moving zone
   * It should be only for last zones as you might get caught by the fast moving first or second zone while you're fighting.

That's all I have for now.

In the last big patches (I.E new seasons) We have the skill gap being lowered. Many content creators out there state that it's to make it fun for the new players. Although I agree with that statement. That statement makes it seem that new players will not learn and improve after playing the game for a while. The nerf to the health of buildings is a big example of this. Now it takes more mats when you're in a build fight and the rate of farming mats have not even increased. The direction you are taking Fortnite Battle Royale is not a competitive e-sport, it's becoming more and more casual for new players. While it is easy to get new players hooked to the game with these casual features. The ""good"" players that have been playing since the beginning get neglected through these updates. The more you change about the core gameplay, the more the old players will start leaving your community. The recent change to gliders is a great example of this. It removes one of the biggest skills to the game, being able to reset a build fight, and watching the storm circle. The new addition of redeploying removes the whole point of resetting a fight and watching the storm. If you get shot down. You fly away. If you don't watch the storm and it gets to you and you don't have a launch pad? No worries, you build up and fly away. It's fine IF it's just an experiment but atleast make it its' own separate mode, not a change to the whole game.",FortNiteBR

Then immediately nueter them all by giving everyone glider redeploy.  

Why jump on a Quad with your teammate when 100 mats is almost always the superior traversal method?

Then they tell us they want to nerf players who turtle (in a game called FORTnite, but OK) and then their solution is to implement seep damage through walls.

What would you guys improve to spam to get better? i really have to work on my aim and sometimes i fail with building but i guess that happens sometimes.

I would call my aim mediocore and my building and editing is pretty fast.

The amount of complaining and harassment on this sub is insane. Like, extremely insane. I can‚Äôt emphasize how toxic this subreddit is, but trust me it is bad. 

Also, this is just me blowing off steam. May be a few grammatical errors and a few signs if repetition. 

**‚Äî**

To start things off, I know a few cheeky people are going to call me out for being a hypocrite for making this post; complaining about the people who complain. I admit that sometimes I complain about things, and I also admit that sometimes I say mean things to people too. Do I regret these things? Yes, I do. I actually took the time to understand that I should just keep things to myself rather than openly blurting them out without keeping the rules of the sub and reddit in consideration. Do I still sometimes do these things? Yes. I‚Äôm not perfect. In contrast to the other people in this subreddit though... I‚Äôm fine.

Browsing this subreddit and making content for it (which I will continue to do) has been a pretty rough experience, especially in the past two months or so. Originally at around 300k subscribers, people were nice to each other and complaining wasn‚Äôt as rampant as it is now. But now? This sub is filled with toxicity, mostly due to the influx of generally younger people (who learned that suggestions sometimes get implemented from here) and the vast popularity of Fortnite. 

Keeping this in mind, a mix of a large audience and a lot of kids is not good. Some kids are actually really cool and don‚Äôt act like animals. Some adults are really cool too, but some of them act like animals too. You can tell the right people from the wrong just by how they act. 

Sorting by hot, you can find the people I‚Äôm talking about. 3/5 posts on this sub are complaining about recent changes (e.g. rocket buff). Every patch people complain and post about it. Epic does literally anything, and people will complain. People will argue. People will fight. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how OGs have been called murderers, rapists, and pedos (trust me, sort by new). It‚Äôs disgusting.

Another thing thats really weird is how people always point out and complain about how instagram, snapchat, etc. are always stealing posts from here. Funnily enough, every day theres at least one post on hot that is stolen. Someone put effort into making that post and someone just reuploads it as their own, under their name. Ironic, right? People always harass these Fortnite accounts for uploading stuff from Reddit, but people from Reddit, from this sub, do the same exact thing.

To finish off this rant, I just want to say that the people who complain about the shop need to stop. First you complain about not having new skins. Update comes, they release in the shop, and then you complain about the skins being bad. So you got what you wanted, and still aren‚Äôt satisfied. Why?

The expectations this sub has is actually insane. Do this! Do that! This isnt what we wanted even though we asked for it! Why would you change the game and buff this and nerf that?

God, please stop complaining and harassing guys. This is the worse state I‚Äôve seen this sub in, the past two months or so.",FortNiteBR

Zombies are just a joke and I understand they‚Äôll be removed.. but comon now.. explosive damage through walls? I know this is being reverted but this honesty goes to show how silly Epic are being with the updates.

There needs to be a danger to building too high, it's part of the skill gap. If someone is not good enough to think about how to anchor his build properly or build too high without jump pad/rift etc. then there should be a punishment for it. You shouldn't be able to jump from a hill and glide onto someones structure *without actually having in-game tools to do it.*

Soooo, hello Epic Games

I'm posting this because i want to send a feedback about a bug, but only some people have this.

So basically, we have a big fps drop since the update 6.21. I thought  i was the only one but i saw on twitter some people complaining about  fps drop like 160 to 10. I don't know what is happening but yesterday  you relased an update for the performance issues and it doesn't resolved  our problems. 

Here are the things i can say about this bug.

First, the time required in the loading is longer than before. When  you are in the bus, your screen is freezing so much. When you drop  sometimes it's not loadging your character, only your trail and your  screen is still freezing a lot. When you are on the ground, sometimes it  take a long time to load your character and you can see your pickaxe  flying. Then when everything is loaded, buildings need to load... When  they are loading you cannot move or something because we have a big fps  drop. When the building is loaded it's really hard to get into a  building. So it's probably an issue on loading charge. But the thing is,  when i was looking at the sky, i saw a purple clound, wich was the  storm coming up, and when he stopped i've got 60 fps and everything was  fine. After that i choosed to get a gun and try to kill some people.  When i started to run around in the map with my quad i had fps drop  again. I got bored and i leaved.

PS: It's the same for STW i absolutely cannot play

I have friends that are literally streaming and playing on the same rig with an 1070 and worse specs. I updated all drivers and no difference.

THE FIX: If you have any of the Additional Command Line Arguments enabled in your fortnite launcher settings.  
And happen to have a command line called  \*\* - NOTEXTURESTREAMING  \*\*.... Just Delete that command line, thats the only one I have deleted so far and my game has came back to some what normal.. I still expect more FPS, but it became playable atleast please try this and let me know if this is a possible fix so we can revive these PC players back into game lobbys.

Lately I have only been playing the practice tournaments as it¬¥s the only place where your **performance actually matters** (and they even removed the salty and tomato tournaments without saying anything and not announcing when will they take place).  


The game has been out for too long, and we need a ranked mode to keep our interest in it, this mode should be SOLO of course.

# Every game should matter

One of the biggest problems right now is that 70% of the lobby dies in first circle even in the tournament system. why? because there is no downside to it, in a pub, you just queue again and in tournament mode it¬¥s time based, not game based plus you can only enjoy this game during 3 specific hours of some days.  
Making every game matter using both kills and position indicators will make it so much more interesting, to stay focused on the game, care about dying, playing for placement, etc. which would make it closer to a scrim game or what we see in the real competitive scene.  


# Score/skill based matchmaking?

To be honest this is not even necessary to implement this game mode. My approach is mixing all players together, no matter of their current ranking, so lets say diamond tier players and silver players will be matched against but it¬¥s not really a problem since our performance is being monitored so we will be able to se our **improvement** as we will rank up if we do better.  
*For top players:* Stomping the games and getting 20+ kills or whatever will still be rewarding as they will compete among eachother for being on **top of the ladder.**  
*For bottom players*: They will have the change to climb and practice in a real way, being able to see their **progress** and make use of **different strategies** to place higher on the ladder.  


# I don¬¥t want to play for points

Don¬¥t worry, casual games should always be there and of course the fun LTMs to enjoy even more casual play.

&amp;#x200B;

Both the players have different expectations from the game.

I understand adding things like balloons and other random weapons etc sounds nice for players who play the game just for fun as they have something new to have fun with.

Competitive players take game seriously they practice a lot to master a game mechanics and mastering something is great achievement and it's a thing of pride that I can do it better than other or I can do it. Skilled players like to a skill level to a game so if you put a lot of time into the game it reflects into your gameplay and makes a little more superior than someone who didn't put that much time.

So adding things which now effects gameplay of best players in the game is something which concerns me and what even concerns more is how frequently these changes are made. Fortnite feels like a race rather than a marathon we can't keep up and will get tired and eventually leave.


My suggestion is whatever change is made  keep is in separate mode of game so competitive community is not effected by that and whenever those changes are stable do a vote out system among top ranked players and content greater to put it into co.petative mode.

Skybases used to be high risk high reward. Now they have 0 risk and a super high reward.

Disengaging is a joke now. In a high build fight and you're losing? You can just leave now. No risk, no repercussions because you lost the fight. You just get to walk away and try again.",FortNiteBR

There‚Äôs a lot of items that people just don‚Äôt want to use anymore and it would be nice to try the new skins coming out. 

Also, why is there even a time limit on when we can refund items? That should also be changed.. There‚Äôs no reason for it other than just being greedy at this point. PLEASE change something about the refunds!",FortNiteBR

And the explosive buff is for the better.,"If you keep complaining about the rockets then you might as well just get turbo building out and limit the materials to 50 for each... so that people use building for advantageous position not freaking turtleling every 5 seconds. So basically explosives buffs are a response to the community cancerous play of no skill 4walls+1Roof+2pyramids that makes almost any weapon obsolete.

If you actually think you are a skilled player stop complaining and start adapting using the building option as it should be used, and get an advantageous position from which you can take your opponent out(and now you can disengage easily as well with the re-deploy option, there are so many options there).

&amp;#x200B;

People are still butthurt because it seems that many ""Famous"" streamers with Diva complexes keep pointing how disappointing they are and keep licking their viewers in the wrong way, I guess they can't win that many matches since the ""not gonna turtle anymore but actually gonna use my brain to get the advantage in this fight without easy turbos"" patch. That is actually a good thing for competitive and not-competitve scenes, competitive 60 in the last 3 circles shit won't happen anymore and now people with ""Turtle"" complex won't win that many fights in the normal games.

&amp;#x200B;

PS. On the % part of the explosive damage through walls might need a work around, I guess they are doing just that right now and testing the ground. Also there is a possibility that the rocket launchers might have a bigger delay before firing again etc.",FortNiteBR

This gun isn't op, it's just a spam weapon with a low skill ceiling. I think this is toxic to Br. When a player can get the upper hand by holding down shoot button for 15 seconds straight isn't what this game should be.

I'm not saying miniguns should be taken out, I'm saying to balance them they should have either an ammo cap or a cooldown use. (Kinda how like in every game with a minigun it heats up, and you need to let it cool down before using it again.)

The more BR gets competitive, the more it needs to adjust it's playstyle and create a balanced meta. They added explosive damage through walls and experimented with glider deploy. This should be the next step.

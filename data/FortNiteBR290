The new detective's office building that has appeared in Retail Row has a photograph ([Link](https://image.ibb.co/dj5T4y/1.png)) of what looks like Anarchy Acres at first, but it has a wagon wheel with it and a tree that isn't in the current Anarchy.

NOTE the strange, twisted tree in the background of that image that is nowhere in the current BR map.

BUT the same tree and the same desert biome featured in a May 2018 Save the World event where we had a desert biome.

You can spot the same twisted trees [in this image](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/eng_3-canny-valley.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=782&amp;strip=all), down by that waterfall.

Sure, that biome, named ""Thunder Route 99"" came to STW in May, but it is also going to be a part of a new map that is being introduced to STW in Season 5.

In Version 5.0, it is going to be a part of regular STW gameplay as a third map, [source](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/save-the-world-state-of-development---june-2018) -- scroll down to ""Canny Valley"" on that page and check the image.

I am also 100% sure that I have seen the same wagon wheel in that event.

Epic has previously used a lot of resources common to both STW and BR, for example STW has a lot of buildings from Tilted Towers, the entire Pleasant Park and Retail Row, and the main Tomato Town building.

- - -

**More Speculation**

With all the portal warps going on and things disappearing from this map, it's highly likely that we will go back in time to a ""wild west"" type of map. Epic has confirmed long ago (even before Lucky Landing released) that they are working on a second map and plan to release it in the future.

Things will keep disappearing from the current BR map, until all of us are warped into the portal and dropped onto a new map at the inception of Season 5.

If you want to see more of the desert biome that STW had, look up ""Save the World Survive the Storm"" on Youtube, you can see full gameplay in that biome. Here's another [image](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fsurvive-thunder-route-99%2FStW03_AridSurvival_Screenshot_01-1280x720-e2294303bf32d383d0674e3eb0ef13f051e1eac8.jpg) of that biome.

1) Increase volume of footsteps, difficult to identify where anyone else is during a build battle.

2) Prevent your friends from editing your own walls.

3) Allow us to keep our loot after death instead of having to go pick it up each time you respawn.

4) Increase the ammo amount you get from ammo boxes.

5) Give us the option to toggle our locator on the map on/off ( turn on to find friends faster while chilling around, off when your simulating a real fight and dont want to give away your location)

5) more llamas

I'm posting here because I am having problems logging into my main account, bopinbartbimpson. I was grinding battle pass tiers (made it to 83) and what not, when something strange happened.  


Eventually, whenever I jumped from the battle bus, it gave me an error stating that I was removed from the match due to a bad internet connection (my connection is wired and more than capable), using a vpn (most likely, i think i had Hamachi or Psiphon open from opening up a server with my friend on another game), or cheating (I've never cheated in Fortnite and never plan to.)  


Epic, check my stats on bopinbartbimpson and you'll see i'm not a hacker. I've had what, like 2-3 wins outside of 50s? I've looked up people having the same problem and apparently this means I've been banned. However, it strikes me as weird that Epic never sent me an email explaining the ban or any related events.  


This is a big inconvenience to me considering that I'm not far from tier 100 and there's like a week left in the season. I got the visitor skin, and that's as far as I made it. I also cannot play on alt accounts, as it will give me the same error message when i jump out of the bus. I'd love an explanation and for Epic to actually reach out to me on this situation, since this is a huge problem for me.

So my story starts March, around season 3.
I was introduced to Fortnite and downloaded it on my PS4. Played casually on and off. When season 4 got released I was really into it. In shorts I’ve been playing over 750 games in this season and I have around only 270 kills. No (legit) wins
And I consider myself below average.
All of my friends already have a pc squad and I’m left out.
So back when I was at 500 games I made a post on Reddit and I explained the situation. Linked up with a someone who was nice and a great player, ...and the first time we played after 10 minutes he just left/blocked/ghosted me..

All I really want is to play with some one, to learn how to play and not get upset with every match.
I’m making this post because of playgrounds maybe that could help someone help me without raging.
I understand I’m not the ideal partner because of all mentioned above, but I can try, and if It’s too bad just tell me you’re not up for it anymore and I’ll understand.

Maybe instead of looking for good players/coaches I should look for someone like me? Idk really lost here.
Also  - I don’t want to seem desperate or something like that,-  it would just be nice to play with someone especially now with Playgrounds.

Not to mention the bloom on this thing is literally better than any AR at medium range.

Epic communicated horribly and kept fans hanging on the line for a release that was not going to come, and continued to give meaningless updates. So Epic also lost a lot of reputation and goodwill with fans by the way things went down. 

Fast forward to this weekend: Epic worked out the kinks in Playground and made it ready for release, but first they had to win back the trust of the fans who were let down.

How did they do it?—

Step 1. Finally become very open with fans about the difficulties faced by the developers. Make sure to make the obstacles face by Epic seem insurmountable, so fans maybe gain some empathy with Epic and understand why it may be taking so long.

Step 2. Give a vague timeline for the Playground release that makes it certain to the fans that the problem is so complex that it would take any developer staff more days and/or weeks to get the Playground ready for release.

Step 3. Suddenly, on the very same Monday, declare Playground ready for release. Of course it was ready already, but Epic makes the fans believe that Epic was facing an impossible task but somehow managed to pull off a miracle for its fans.

Step 4. Profit",FortNiteBR

This has happened twice already, and in both occurrences, I have felt really sad. All I do is talk and have fun with them in the voice channel. One day all of a sudden, 3 of my friends leave the voice chat all at once, leaving me and 2 others in the voice chat. Another leaves without reason, leaving me and 1 friend in voice chat. The last one says, ""im gonna go eat dinner, but I will be back"". I wait 3 hours, alone. No one comes back. I check to see if they are online playing a game or something. Sure enough, I see all of the people who left playing fortnite in a squad. I start to feel anxious because this has happened before, because they all just decided I was toxic out of complete nowhere. I didn't think they would do t his to me again, and they know that my weakness is being left out of activities with my friends. They ignore my messages, and ignore my in-game invites. i see them in a 3/4 squad, so i wait for them to be done so i could join and play, but they make the party private so I need an invite to join. They get a 4th person in their squad, leaving no room for me, who has been waiting quite a while. The really sad part of all of this is that we could be having a great time, and I wouldn't have a worry of being ditched again like before, and all of a sudden, they leave me. They went as far as making a new discord server without me on purpose behind my back. This is just so depressing and angering. What do you guys suggest I do? ",FortNiteBR

Hear me out, because I’m really not trying to sound like these 11 year olds in twitter comments. Playground is the best mode to practice building or just to mess around with friends. For example, if you are in a slump and haven’t had success lately, you can hop right in playgrounds to practice, weather that’s building, or shooting it doesn’t matter. In my opinion it’s a great stress relief from actual online games and you don’t have to worry about someone killing or shooting you down when practicing. Plus, it is GREAT content opportunity for you-tubers who spread the message of your game and make it grow. The possibilities are endless in this mode and its really a blast.

Epic Games do know what they are doing and working their ass off! Noone would ever see fortnite to grow this fast and breaking records everyday.. noone have this such of big servers to run 5-10mill online players at once. 

It is a free game and still beta, accept bugs,glitch,server maintaince and updates every second day.. if not... go play another game. 

Epic Games working so hard to please us all so be patient and enjoy the game as it is.. playground is coming when its ready.. nerfing the weapons and matherials actually gave me an alot better experiance with the game and i know alot of you guys agree with me.

Keep on rocking epic. Peace and Love.

In 50v50 its so very rare that teammates run with you(other than to steal loot) or land together(nevermind tilted towers). People will literally just run past you and snag loot wayy before they try to revive, thats if they even do so. In teams of 12's the amount of people left on the team actually matters, so reviving team mates is much more an incentive to win, than to just get the best gold loot and rush for kills. I know this is an extremely unpopular opinion, as a bunch of the playerbase hated this LTM(for no other reason than the storm circle)  But IMO 12's was the best big team game mode to be rolled out so far, i would like to see it return with a fixed storm circle algorithm. Thanks for your time, I would like to hear reddits thoughts on the matter though, what was your favorite big team game mode so far, and let us know why :D",FortNiteBR

Last week I went on holidays with my family. My little cousin was just given a PS4 the day before for his birthday, and while away from home I tried to do a nice thing and let him use my Fortnite account to mess around on since he didn't have his own and had no other games with him. 

I logged him on and thought nothing of it all weekend.

So you can imagine my horror this week when I get home and attempt to log in on my xbox and, surprise... My Epic account has been locked to the Playstation ecosystem.

It's all gone. My founders account, over a hundred hours of progress on Save the World, over a hundred dollars worth of skins and purchases on Battle Royale.

All locked because of the closed minded greed of Sony. And apparently I'm just one of hundreds of others in the same boat.

But I really don't enjoy playing the new META where Explosives are buffed and OP.

Basically just get an RPG (I think RPG &gt; GL after the buff), build a 1x1 late game and just shoot at players and rocket their bases.

Unless you fight a beast pro builder that has 2000 mats, or some guy that quickscope your face while falling or bouncepadding, just, play safe and you'll get a win very easily.

Not mentioning the new best mid-long range weapon that is the blue Silenceed SMG, better than a scar at destroying player's structures and at lasering people.

I don't see what EPIC wanted that is like ""more diverse way to win the end game""

I just see ""just build lol"" getting nerfed and replaced by ""just rocket/c4/gl lol"" (with a minimum of intelligence).

Like I honestly prefer facing a guy with 48 rockets ammo before buff than facing a guy with 18 rockets after the buff. 
At least you could like, just put one wall and it would stop it. 
Now you cover all your sides over and over, let's say 18x6 (wall+roof+floor) 

That's 540 wood.
3mn of farming.

I just loved the season 3 (first half).
I started to build and i began even to do build battles. 

My favourite weapon was the old Shotgun. The good old shotgun. 

I loved the headshot damage.
But one day, i saw i could not do heavy damage to the players with my shotgun.
I thought it was my fault, i just needed to ""FiX mY AiM"", but all my squad felt like me.
Even the friends of my teammates felt like me.

But, that's ok, i just started to think twice when i was pointing the shotgun to an enemy, and tried to do big build battle with my loved shotgun in my hand.

I loved that.

Untill, epic nerfed the pump. 
Even the headshot damage.

I was like ""No, please, i don't want to switch to the Tac""

I was forced to switch. The normal pump just wasn't reliable, just no more.

And i have no problem with the Tac/Heavy now, almost no problem, they're irrelevant

And i began to build like a savage.
And they nerfed the llamas and the materials in general.

And then i was bored.
So bored of Epic just changing totally my gameplay. I played Fortnite because i liked to play like i wanted to. I spent money on Fortnite just because i liked the game how it was.
But now, i just can't play how i want.

It is just boring have to farm materials in end game. I want to play FORTnite, not Farming Simulator.

I want to do FORTS, not to harvest.

And now, i think the BR is just boring. So, even if before i played like 50% BR and 50% StW, now i play 80% StW and 20% BR.

It is just sad how (in my opinion) BR has become.

I understand the need of let the ""Casuals"" play, but for me, it is just enought.

I'm pissed, I bought the battle hound skin and it was great.  I paid £20 for a skin that I really liked and then they added a giant, ugly, white, furry bar across the back of it? I just want what I originally paid for.

This may come across that I didn't want the skin to come back. I really don't care if a skin comes back. Why can't someone have a skin that they wanted, they are pixels.

To make this clearer how would you like it if epic changed one of your favourite skins because someone didn’t like it. And yes I bought it first time around.

If they could just revert the cape to what it originally looked like ( when it is on battle hound ) i would be more than happy. In my opinion I feel like I don't want to use the skin as the ugly bar ruins it. I know a lot of people will disagree with this. However I feel like I have just wasted my money, It looked so much better before.

Hey everyone!

Like the title implies I have a goal to hit level 80 before the season ends at the end of next weekend.

I’m currently just under level 69.

I have a lowballed estimate of 150k XP that I’ll need to finally ding at 80.

The kicker is that I’m only able to play for a few hours a day because of work and other obligations.  I might add that I’m not amazing at the game but I’m not terrible either.

In your experience will it be possible for me to hit level 80 before the season’s end?  Because based off my average XP gain, I’m thinking it won’t be.  Hoping to be proven wrong! Lmao. 

** Also, if I were to hypothetically play hours with 3 friends that are all tier 100.  Would their Friend XP Boost be a determining factor?

Also, if y’all have any advice that’d be appreciated.

I just figure that since I bought the battle pass may as well maximize the return I get for it, right?

Thanks!

This is well into Season 5. Due to this announcement, we have confirmation that Risky Reels will still exist in Season 5. This means a couple things.

1. Season 5 probably isn't history themed.
2. if it IS, it will probably either be a ""leak"" of history into our current world (would make sense, the time rip and all)
3. it could either be the ""leak"" of history, or just another play/movie, like we've had for Season 4",FortNiteBR

The dude digs for mining info, so we'll know what's coming out down the road. I agree data-mining ruins the fun of the game. Before people were doing this, Fortnite's surprises were fun. But if you're an avid player of the game, there's no doubt you'll see this info soon. With Season 5 right around the corner, I have created a very detailed theory on what is to come in the game from data-mining info that has been released. 

# A new map (or a huge makeover)

I think Epic Games is gearing up to drop a new map on us. Info found in data-mining has showed that new POI is coming. It seems like Fortnite is going back to the past to the Old Western days. I believe this will be the [biggest makeover](https://twitter.com/FNBRLeaks/status/1012062737004941320) Fortnite has done to the map - ever. 

# New detective skins

The new skins are pretty nostalgic for old school detective work. I think they're just hinting at changing the map completely into a more old-school feel. 

# Tommy Gun

The Tommy Gun is coming out which helps my theory that we're going back to the Old Saloon days. Also, if you look in this [post from FNBRLeaks](https://twitter.com/FNBRLeaks/status/1012949244850900993), you can see just how old the props are in the new POI. 

# The Visitor

I think the Visitor coming back means helps this theory a lot. I think he realizes at what time period went wrong for the world of Fortnite, and going back to the Old Saloon days is how we stop from the Fracture happening. 

What do you guys guys? What can help my theory? What can destroy my theory? I love the theories coming from this and how Fortnite always creates great discussions within the community. ",FortNiteBR

So during season five, each level I earn whilst using the Omega skin will bring it up a level eventually leading up to level 80 (a full Omega).

I think I’m going to update the post with every 10-ish edits. If you have already read the original post, scroll down to the edits.

After everything today I think I have formed the ultimate season 5 theory. But first, I’d like to point out some observations I made.

(Please read the entire post, but if not there is a TL;DR at the bottom)

The crack in the sky. Remember that theory a while ago about how Battle Royale is a simulation? This supports it even more. Not only do you disappear with that drone when you die, but today we have confirmation that the map is in a dome. This doesn’t have anything to do with my theory but I was just pointing it out.

Also, I don’t think the thrusters that landed in anarchy will have any future significance ever again. Usually story items that are important (like the meteor in dusty) are unbreakable. The thrusters however are breakable and I don’t think this is a bug as it seems they were purposely set at 2000 health.


Alright, finally starting off with my theory.
There were many leaks on season 5 being ancient/history themed. I think this will happen but we have to discuss how it will happen, I believe that the visitor has left the dimension and entered a new one. I say this because he disappeared, made a portal type thing, and there was a voice in the rocket saying  “engaging multi-dimensional” or something like that. But he accidentally left that crack in this dimension. This has caused a massive ripple in the space time continuum and now things are going to leak through the portal from hundreds of years ago. The season 5 trailer will be all kinds of things flooding out of the crack in the sky and falling onto the map, and we will get a new POI, possibly the pyramids of Giza or something along those lines. We will also get a history themed battlepass.

This also ties in with the rumor about the Red Knight returning with the datamined Crimson Pickaxe. A knight is mentioned in the game files for the pickaxe. 

Also, the sky stalker skin we got was from WW1, which of course was a long time ago.

I also wanted to thank epic for hosting such a wonderful and enticing event today! I would love to see more like this.

If you have anything you’d like me to add to this theory, comment it and I’ll take a look. 

#TL;DR Season 5 will be history themed and there are many things pointing to this happening.

See you all on the battle bus!

EDIT: As u/LiberalFeminist99 pointed out, the rift could also pull things from the future too!

EDIT 2: Also, u/Chriz146 pointed out that we could not be in a dome since the meteors just punched through the map.

EDIT 3: As u/marcoboyle pointed out, there is a rift at Lonely Lodge. I think maybe every POI will transform one by one into the history theme. 

EDIT 4: Omen and Fate are supposedly time travelers? This could also play into that theme since they were “villains”. But I think they were just actors like carbide and omega. 

EDIT 5: Check out u/IAMNOTELLEN ‘s post.
They talk about how the visitor teleported many times and ended up in all kinds of eras. All those eras are now connected to that giant crack in the sky and will all come out and mess up the map.

EDIT 6: u/ViewtifulAaron pointed out that the Leviathan that people thought would hatch from the meteor could fall out of the rift in the sky and enter the world then destroy moisty.

EDIT 7: The spectrogram of the rocket audio shows this: https://twitter.com/TwoEpicBuddies/status/1012039860738281472

EDIT 8: As u/Je11o said, could the Dino footprint have anything to do with the theory?

EDIT 9: Also would like to add that in the playground trailer here: https://youtu.be/g5PeLQmYOYk There are some things that could support my theory of a history theme. You can see players building a pyramid, the Sphinx, and there is a part set in the Wild West. Could these be hinting at a history theme?

EDIT 10: We also have detective skins coming soon and the tommy gun. This also shows that it doesn’t have to be ancient and could even be set in the 50’s or something.

EDIT 11: Check out this post about how Vertex plays in to this whole thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vaim3/rocket_mystery_solved/?st=JJ3397XA&amp;amp;sh=86478a25

EDIT 12: The rift at lonely lodge has gotten bigger.  I think it’s going to slowly consume that entire POI. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vbt5l/it_has_changed/?st=JJ3AGGUO&amp;amp;sh=3e676acb

EDIT 13: Reports that the crack in the sky has gotten bigger?

EDIT 14: A new rift has opened in the motel. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vcins/this_has_been_spotted_at_the_motel/?st=JJ3BA3K8&amp;sh=ac6cde83

EDIT 15: Reports of the rift at motel making a creepy noise.

EDIT 16: Reports of a new rift opening at wailing woods! I will update this post with a picture soon if this is true.

EDIT 17: An interesting theory: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vc62x/the_island_isnt_protected_by_a_shield_the/?st=JJ3BYVYP&amp;sh=45cd6247
I agree on how things are going to leak through the crack.

EDIT 18: The rift in lonely is gone. With it, it has eaten up parts of the structures nearby. Could this mean the huge rift in the sky will eat up parts of the entire map? We will have to wait and see what happens with the rift at motel.

EDIT 19: Something significant to note: the rifts are destroying the signs of points of interests. The lonely lodge sign and motel sign have been the first to get targeted. What could this mean?

EDIT 20: The crack is getting bigger. I think by the end of season 4 the whole sky will just break and all the universes will just leak in. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vft3r/proof_that_the_fracture_is_steadily_growing_with/?st=JJ3SWK84&amp;sh=b69a5b89

EDIT 21: Roman numerals found at Flush. This is definitely a hint towards season 5. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vkofv/roman_numerals_in_flush_factory_and_it_says_july/?st=JJ4MN1UQ&amp;sh=74331994",FortNiteBR

I figured we could try to get lobbies full of redditors, get the content we need and then some amazingly talented video magician stitch it all together and share the magic! Would that be something this community would be interested in doing? If so we could create a discord to communicate through the process and possibly come up with more ideas.

I won't lie and say ""I've been playing fortnite the hour it came out,"" because I haven't, I began playing late season 1 not giving a care in the world for cosmetics but like many others, my mind changed. My first in game purchase was the season 2 battle pass but because I bought it late I was only able to make it to tier 45 just missing out on the sparkle specialist :( with my jealousy of people who had the black knight I became even more dedicated and determined so I bought the season 3 battle pass. Little did I know that I would finish grinding for a mediocre John Wick skin three weeks before the end of the season and that also 90&amp;#37; of the lobby population would also have him at the same time. 

However, I realised that if the s3 battle pass was a big failure then epic would obviously change it in the following season, believing this I enthusiastically bought the following season battle pass. But I was wrong, Epic had done the exact same thing making Omega incredibly easy to acquire and at the same time implementing a stupid system rewarding those who spend 24 hours a day playing the game not the skilful and I can wholeheartedly guarantee you that the Season 5 battle pass will feature the exact same problems.",FortNiteBR

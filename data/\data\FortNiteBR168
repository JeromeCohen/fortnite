(this is not a witch hunt) I'm just saying he should stop doing this. Because if epic doesn't fully review the gameplay alot of innocent people could be getting banned. And I think the reason he does this is because is because he's not the best player anymore he is very good but not as good as the pros and some other people he's lacking in skill so he uses stream sniping as an excuse So ninja please stop. ,FortNiteBR

I had to engage a lot more (which made me better) but now I find even beginners can drop outside and get to the top 10 really easily. The reason is because the storm isn’t feared anymore. 

I counted and was shocked there were 11 things currently in the game that CAN prevent against the storm:

Glider deploy off mountains 

Glider deploy off self built 

Grappler

Shockwave Impulse

Quad Crashers

Golf Carts 

Shadow Stones

Infected area booster pits

21,magaons,1541930847,9w2pyk,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9w2pyk/state_of_the_game_right_now/,1,State of the game right now,"The game right now is a mess, glider re-deployment is still in the game due to 'positive feedback' (don't know where they're getting the feedback from and how, at least do an in-game survey or something), building is basically useless since you can just pickaxe a wall twice and then it breaks and shotguns are useless. 
A lot of people might disagree but I think double pump was perfectly balanced at the end of season 4, pumps did 8 damage every shot so now you can do 16 instead of just 8, smgs were viable and building was a good counter to both, pump smg and double pump. It took some skill. Double pump wasn't completely brain dead, it somewhat required aim. Pump and SMG could be countered by building and was viable. 
Now in season 6 the game is so repetitive, you get spammed on by an smg and building is useless, you can't die from fall damage because of glider redeployment, shotguns do no damage and if you wan't a gun that does something you have to get lucky. 
Before you say 'they're just catering it to noobs' then that's just stupid because pump smg will still be viable just like it is now.
Solution - bring back double pump, bring back tac smgs (they sound nicer even if they're the same now) and remove the glider redeployment. Epic should implement a system similar to Runescape, add a poll and let the community vote before adding a big change. ",FortNiteBR

31,closedconnor,1541926274,9w2dhh,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9w2dhh/possible_gun_idea/,1,possible gun idea,"I am a skilled Fortnite player and love the game dearly, however I have noticed that skill cap weapons are decreasing. I'm a good enough player to when a bot could have any gun and ill still kill them, they don't matter as much. However I do think there are guns that act sort of as a crutch to the bad players. This consists of guns such as, quad launcher, double barrel, and P90. So here I am making a probably useless post idea, but I think it would be a good idea to add a sort of slug style shotgun. Basically a KSG, super accurate, high damage, and range on par to the heavy shotgun but maybe less damage fall off. This would be the first shotgun in the game that has a much more unique mechanic, no bullet spread and rather it would have a bullet like a sniper. The body shot damage 110/120, and head-shot 220/240 since the gun would only be in epic and legendary variants. The gun deserves the damage and ability to one-shot based on the precise accuracy needed to be effective with the weapon; and although the gun does have high damage this gun would cause most people to play all situations different from how they would play with a pump shotgun.  Needing to keep a distance to be safe would be crucial play for the gun opposed to the sort of in your face barrel-stuff play style used by the double barrel and tactical shotgun. This gun definitely does benefit players who have trained their accuracy, but doesn't mean that no one could beat it. If the gun has a slow shot time, maybe about the same as the pump and they whiff their bullet it would be prime to take advantage of the downtime between shots. Anyways I think this gun would be balanced and fun for the game and also add diversity to the meta. Please let me know what you think and any suggestions regarding my idea, because maybe if we can work it out we could see it in battle royale :)",FortNiteBR

This is what we want(feel free to give constructive criticism on these, want to make sure the whole community is satisfied):

Vaulted items and added items:

Bring back bouncers
Vault chiller
Bring back silenced smg(only 2 smgs in game, need more), and maybe add silenced P90(more accurate, more damage, less fire rate, maybe less mag size)to allow more smg play styles

Gameplay:

Mats increase by 10/20%
Glider redeploy: Turned off
Balloons: Allows glider redeploy

Balance changes:

Changes to the circle timer/load(in seconds):

Pump-pump delay: 0.9
Pump to tac delay: 0.6
Pump to heavy delay: 0.8
Heavy to tac delay: 0.6
Tac to tac delay: 1.0
Heavy to heavy delay: 0.8
Double barrel to any shotgun delay: 1.5

Maybe make it so if you carry one shotgun, the headshot multiplier is 2.5, and if you carry two, the headshot multiplier is 2.0.

Buff smg accuracy by 10-15%

Reason: This will introduce other styles of gameplay and keep it balanced, so one isn’t more powerful than the other(shotgun-smg, shotgun-shotgun, solo shotgun, solo smg). Also it won’t make it ping based(unless it’s really high, but at that point ur at a disadvantage anyway)since you could pull out the shotgun a little later(so it can register)and still have the same speed.

Feel free to discuss a lot about this, it’s a touchy subject.

Bouncer rarity: Epic
Launchpad drop rate: +2%

I am not having fun anymore in this game and my reasons to play it are diminishing. Fortnite has severely turned its direction from what inititially contributed to it's popularity. I have been actively playing since January and I can say that these last few months I am not having as much fun as I would usually have and I hope this view alligns with everyone else. I'll break down some suggestions for epic and overall give my opinion on how this game can bring back the element of joy and make gamers want to continue playing.

​

# Changes

One thing I can say is that Epic has been implementing too many cnges too quickly. It feels as though they are fearing their downfall and trying their best to change the game without putting thought into the affect it may have. Keep in mind, I'm not saying change is bad, in fact it's good to spice things up everynow and then, however it becomes bad once it begins to impact core fundamentals and mechanics which made Fortnite the game it is today. And don't even mention server performance, my god its the worst its ever been! I struggle to play a proper game without having severe lag spikes. Compared to times of season 2 and 3, game performance was barely an issue. Now I do understand that the playerbase has massively spiked but thats no to say that these constant updates aren't contributing to performance. Here's my suggestion to Epic, JUST CHILL! We don't need content updates every single week. First work on server performance rather than focusing on these updates. I'm sure players can wait for 2 or even three weeks for an update, its not neccassary for one every single week.

​

# Glider Re-deploy

Okay, lets talk about this thing. So I am aware that this sub has a lot of mixed views on this feature but personally I dislike it. I just feel like its becoming more of a nuisance than an actual benefit. Players having highground should still have something to fear, a consequence in gaining highground. Same for players in lowground, they shouldn't be able to just fly away at points of disadvantage, it doesn't give them any consequences for their actions. I reckon without the re-deploy It balances highground and lowground instances. Currently fights are becoming too disengaged and not free flowing as it once was. I know how epic considers it as a way to avoid thirt partying but thats part of the game epic, third party is inevitable. The only thing this glider implementation does right now is increase it, more players are able to rotate and third party. I've been finding my self playing against 5 to 6 other players as soon as I engage in a fight. It's just wrong. It takes away the fun and rewards players that just bail fights.

I don't see Epic changing this feature any time soon so a fix I would suggest would be to buff materials. Either increase the cap or increase how much you recieve from farming. Currently players find themselves shredding through mats in a battle, only for their oponent to fly away where then both players are at a disadvantage if another engagment was too happen, having burnt through their mats for no reason. Being able to quickly farm up something would atleast help this problem. Something like the blitz game mode would be a good representation of this.

​

# META and Skill Gap

So now clearly the game has had tonnes of changes in gameplay. Season 5 being the 'Spray and Pray' meta was probably the worst of them all. Although fixes have come in place do combat this I still feel that it hangs around in the current state. Comparing the meta to Season 2/3 it has completely been altered and has made the game less enjoyable as it grants less skillful players with easy to play guns. In the hands of pros however it only increase skill gap and makes it difficult for new players to actually get a grasp of the game. For new players to start playing at this stage, it's almost impossible, the skill gap is too large and Epic is the one fueling it. It's like a constant cycle - helping new players by changing mechanics or introducing easier new weapons which makes it easier for established players to tear apart the lobby, Not Fun! A good meta to re-introduce would be the one at the end of season 4. I feel at this stage the game was the most balance it had every been. They're was no shotgun delay making shotguns and smgs perfectly balance, they could compete with each other. They was a fair counter to everything. It was largely dependent on skill. Double Pump vs say an SMG, or Tac Smg would have neither party at a disadvantage. This was when it was the most fun, no restrictions just clean, easy, balanced gameplay.

​

In conclusion I hope Epic takes some of this feedback idk, I just wanted to let out my frustration and give my opinion on how this game can become fun again. Thank You :)",FortNiteBR

So far I have re-downloaded the game twice in hopes of it working again but nothing seemed to work. My mic works fine in other games and in party chat so that couldn’t be a factor. I haven’t really heard about anyone else having this issue so I wanted to see if anyone has experienced this and if they had come up with any solutions.

I think buffing pick axe damage to 20 or 25 damage could actually make melee viable for early game fights. There are times when rng is terrible and you can't find a gun and if your opponent has one you're pretty much dead, but buffing pick axe damage could change that. If it were 20 damage all it would take would be 5 hits to kill an opponent, if it were 25 it would take 4. I believe this would be a healthy addition to the game.

I personally think it’s a great addition to the game and love how it lets you move fast and flee if you need to heal or reload. He says that nobody likes it and the streamers hate it. He acts like the streamers are the majority. I’m sorry but they are not and Epic knows this. I personally believe that Epic wants to promote more straight forward gun fights without huge builds. If a person who you out build can just fly away which cost you all your mats every time then maybe you’ll just take on the fight and stop the massive builds. Without the “Bots” as everyone puts it, the game wouldn’t be what it is today. ",FortNiteBR

Redeploy simply pisses off too many people.  No one was threatening to uninstall Fortnite three weeks ago if Epic didn't add it to the game.  Mobility wasn't even an issue that was dismissed very much a few weeks ago due to the fact that so many traversal items are in the game at this point.

The pro glider redeploy people enjoyed Fortnite before it was added to the game.  Revert the change and those people go back to enjoying the game (albeit slightly less).  However, if Epic doesn't revert redeploy a percentage of players are simply livid with the change.  They'll either play less, or stop playing all together.

I don't see how a change this divisive in the community is beneficial to the health of the game.",FortNiteBR

I think 75 was the most balanced traps had been (2 usually killed, 3 guaranteed) however I'm willing to admit that it was very unsatisfying. I think 100 is the correct place for trap damage to feel good, and still require somewhat skill to kill with.

I'm dead because I'm running around like a chicken with its head cut off, throwing my fucking Battle Axe around and switching to build mode and back by accident when im trying to fucking SHOOT, then when I actually want to build in a battle, I build the wrong things or can't go even remotely fast enough to win the battle. It. Is fucking. Infuriating. I'm not even landing in tilted or anything, I can't last 5 minutes in fucking salty springs 😠

For the record, I know what the controls are ... It's when I get into a battle with someone where I have to act quickly that I start pressing the wrong shit.

I can easily drop 6 or 7 kills with the Xbox player but when I play with the ps4 play we constantly get absolutely murked. I’m not saying that ps4 players are better but the lobby’s are so much more competitive it seems like. Also theirs seems to be a lot more default skins on Xbox while I hardly find one on ps4. Again, if you play on Xbox I’m not saying you’re bad, but I believe there’s a clear difference.

With these V-Bucks, I purchased a couple of skins and a glider. However, when I logged back in to play on 8 November, all of the above items, as well as some older purchases, had disappeared. Instead, I found 1000 V-bucks had appeared in my account. No refund had been requested. So right now, I am down 5000 V-bucks with nothing to show for it. A glitch has robbed me of my money.

I have contacted Epic Games support, and they've been as useless as tits on a bull. Their best suggestion is to approach Microsoft support about refunds. How exactly does Microsoft come into this? Epic took the V-Bucks and stole back the purchased items. This is theft.

Check out the email thread for all of Epic Game's support wisdom.

Any suggestions? Has anyone else had this happen?",FortNiteBR

[And image because it got removed](https://i.imgur.com/tPgDbx9.png)


Yesterday hundreds of negative comments were left on [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/7O-dMgO467c), coming from this subreddit and supporting me.

Following that, MacMacs deleted his Reddit account and proceed to delete every single comment on his video calling him out for stealing my post, my script and my images, all that I did in photoshop. Word by word.

After all that trouble, all he did was edit his description to add that I 'gave him the idea' which honestly was outrageous, all the content in the video was made by me.

Following that and the help of this subreddit, I managed to do a report for Youtube, but they never contacted me back like they said they would.

After my post got removed, MacMacs deleted all negative comments, so his video has no 'main' trace on him stealing the content from me, replies to his pinned tweet are still there [these are the ones that are still up since you cannot delete replies](https://imgur.com/a/WUxsvDf)

**His video was 200k views yesterday, it is now 500k** and I honestly feel robbed, I've seen this subreddit call out youtubers and content thieves like this many times, [right now there is a post about Ricegum buying accounts, but it isn't removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9vmrzz/ricegum_is_buying_accounts_and_heres_some_proof/) so when the moderator told me the reason mine was removed because **''the subreddit can't help you''** I was upset.

Now I'm posting this again because I felt my previous post was going somewhere, I had support, evidence and I'm pretty sure Content Steal is something that breaks the Support-A-Creator terms, if HappyPower got removed then this guy, stealing all of my work, can be removed too.... at least.

It’s absolutely possible that over the course of a lifetime, someone can drop their controller, or whatever, and end up making accidental purchases far more than 3 times.

You know what would prevent this? A confirmation button. You know, like the one that pops up consistently when you’re choosing to make a refund?

It seems the only reason to avoid this would be malicious intent, knowing that people will make accidental purchases and not be able to refund them - thus making the customer buy more vbucks to make the purchases they actually want.

In my opinion, this is either absolutely unethical, or 100% lazy.. and I think I know which option to put my money on.

Just some food for thought. And no, I’m not wishing to refund anything, this thought has came to mind after witnessing multiple posts about accidental purchases.

***This post isn't an excuse for self-conscious 9 year olds who need self-validation to talk about their BS stats and call me bad for having a problem with the game. Rant over.***

It feels like every solo game, I kill one person and the whole lobby's on me. Literally just now, I killed 2 people one after the other start game, only to get *^(season 6 splodes through walls i cant kill people spray and pray also)* *~~^(third)~~* *^(fourth party meta)*'d while I'm trying to heal. I can finish fights in less than 10 seconds and I still have someone waiting to one shot me.

I check, and I'm still in the solos playlist. Why do people have to go after every fight within 5 seconds just to leech off of enemies for kills.

***Now for the splodes aspect***

'Splodes were unfair before. You could pick off an explosive weapon right of the bat, and kill 6 people straight away with no skill involved. ***Now you don't even get the chance to box yourself in and heal before being anal-raped by rockets!*** Honestly, what was Epic thinking!?

And now for an extra: **Glider Redeploy**

You get someone low, and all of a sudden they jump off your build fight and heall 300m away from where you finished fighting. Just remove glider redeploy and bring back bouncers. You don't need to vault the same thing twice.

A shotgun is supposed to be the strongest close range gun in the game.

You should not HAVE to have an SMG in order to win close range.

If it was balanced, you would be able to have a fair and equal chance at winning  by just using shotgun, just using SMG and using both the shot gun and the SMG.

Also, Sure. Lets say my aim is terrible (which it isn't)

I don't care how many pellets hit, from close range...A SHOTGUN should NOT be doing anywhere near 7-20 dmg.

I was gonna bring up the fact that they should be able to one tap..But Nah, Just  make shotguns not basically completely useless 70% of the time, and well be happy.

I can win reasonably consistently and average about 5 kills per game.  Decent builder and can win a lot of the build fights I get into.   There are people that are better than me for sure and some that are beyond my comprehension so while I think I’m ok I know I am nowhere near the best.  All this to say that I am a reasonably skilled and knowledgeable player but not amazing.  

I just started playing on PC.  Mostly out of curiosity.  

The first thing is that I am now an absolutely terrible player. Awful!  And what makes it worse is that I know what I need to do but I just can’t do it.  I see situations unfold that I previously would have taken advantage of or avoided and now I can’t do either.  

Switching weapons while easy in theory is hard!   I don’t have enough fingers!   Switching modes is confusing again.  And selecting the building type (wall,ramp etc) is a shit show inside a dumpster fire.  

I have played a few games in playground but the burning crucible of public games is where muscle memory forms for me. I need to be able to do things under pressure for them to be usable ...under pressure.  In playground I can now ramp and sorta wall to protect myself.  In my last game people were ramping on me and all I could build was a single lonely wall.   A sad wall that was half in the ground not even facing my rushing enemies.  


On console I play as a default skin because I think it gives me a little extra advantage but on pc I am now an actual default skin.  

One thing that’s interesting to me is how easy editing is on pc.  I’ve seen videos of amazing editors on pc and always been blown away but editing on of is trivially easy compared to console.  Now this is in playground and not under pressure but quickly switching a window in a wall is a cake walk compared to console.  Ramp switches, floor and wall and pyramid edits are all just so much easier.  And I’m a decent editor on console so I can compare mechanics pretty well. If you see a good editor on console be afraid because they have practiced a ton to get there.  

Another thing is lag.  I don’t have the best pc or graphics card but on console you generally only experience one type of lag.  Network lag.  But on pc it looks like there are two types. Network lag and frame-rate lag. I experience frame-rate lag at odd times now and it’s unsettling.  I don’t know if having a better pc eliminates it or not.  

While I am still new I’m experimenting with button mappings to see if I can find one that works for me.  Before I get locked into muscle memory. 

I’m interested in seeing how I progress and adapt.   How long it will take me to be as good as I was on console.  And if I can be even better.  


Thanks for reading.  If you have any tips on how to play on PC I would appreciate them as I need all the help I can get right now.

https://reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9uk4wd/i_truly_think_redeploy_could_raise_the_skill/


Essentially it’s this

1: make your glider get worn out from use

For example after 3 deploys it’s too worn out to use.

Which brings me to point 2

2: after your glider is worn out it needs to be repaired. 

This needs to take a significant amount of mats. At least 200

3: you should be able to shoot people off of their glider 

You should be more vulnerable.

My idea is that if you take 50 damage you lose your grip and fall.

These changes would balance third partying and force people to be tactful about how they use their redeploy and also raise the skill ceiling in the competitive scene. 

Please give this traction so Epic can at least see these ideas to add to their bran storming sessions about redeploy. 

Thanks guys.

In my opinion, the way superior Minigun should have been vaulted and the LMG should have been kept. Let's overview the stats of these weapons.

Minigun has a fire rate of 12, while LMG has a fire rate of 8. Due to its faster rate of fire, it's more likely to hit an enemy through a building while they are turbo-building.

Minigun also has a magazine size of 999. It doesn't even have to reload. LMG has a 100 bullet magazine and a 5 second reload time. Minigun also uses the most commonly found ammunition type (Light bullets). LMG uses also commonly found, but not that commonly as Light bullets. 

LMG is superior when comparing it with the Minigun in terms of damage. (26 damage compared to 17 damage). Still, Minigun has a higher DPS than LMG, and when talking about headshot damage they are basically same. (LMG: 50, Minigun:46)

LMG has lower bloom than the Minigun and is able to achieve first shot accuracy (although waiting for FSA reset wasn't a smart tactic). But, LMG has heavy recoil while Minigun has none (judging by me, even if it has recoil it's probably not as noticeable as LMGs.

Minigun has no damage dropoff over distance at all.. really?

So, which one of these should be vaulted? Minigun beats LMG in almost EVERY category. In my opinion, Minigun should be vaulted and LMG should be reintroduced with a 75 bullet magazine and vertical and horizontal recoil patterns. It would make the gun unreliable in combat if a player is not able to control the recoil patterns and make it viable for build shredding, which should have been a point of this gun all along. That's only my opinion, if you have any counter-arguments drop them in the comments.",FortNiteBR

What I mean by that is, it feels extremely lazy and dare I day resident sleeper to aim like this. A lot of the time I dont even feel like ""aww shit I hit those"" it's more like ""aww shit fortnite hit those""


Am I alone in this? I really wish this mechanic wasnt so good. Makes me feel as if i have to spam my aim in order to aim. I land shots pretty consistently without this mechanic but i feel like on handicapping myself if i dont use it seeing as EVERYONE uses it.


This mixed with bloom I feel as though the only thing in fortnite I can be proud of is my building. Everything else seems so random. Bloom makes it so no matter how good I aim sometimes I'll miss just because the game said so. On the other hand there is this aim assist spam adding to the randomness to my fights. I've been playing since September 2017 and the only thing I truly dont like about fortnite (sometimes) is the gunplay just seems lazy on console.


TLDR: I personally dislike that spamming ADS to acquire targets is meta for controller players and it seems like a very lazy shooting mechanic that doesn't reward the players aim but instead rewards a lazy mechanic. This mixed with bloom makes for a very poor shooting model imo.",FortNiteBR

3. Weapon rarities, they are completely unnecessary and shouldnt be in the game IMO, like the first point, it is unfair a person should lose a gunfight because the other person was luckier than me in finding a better weapon.

They look great, they are at an excellent price point, they provide so much versatility due to the number being selectable and being able to choose the team you want (which to me means no more than colours I like), I think they're fantastic.  


They are one of very few purchases in the game that are worth the money to me, those being Save The World, the Battlepasses, the starter packs, Ravage (due to contrail) and MAYBE Deadfire due to reactive back-bling and him himself being reactive. I think I'll have to pick up a soccer skin next time they are in the shop because this amount of customisation is a beautiful thing.  


Who else is loving them?  
I'm running with the Green Bay Packers style at the moment because it's green and gold (I am Australian) and it looks awesome. They have to do this more often. The value is immense.

Lets say each after each season the pass increases by 500 vbucks, if you want season 4 pass and its season 6 that would mean it would be 1950 vbucks. It would increase more and more the longer you wait to purchase it. If i want to buy season 2 it would cost 2950 vbucks. Thats almost 30 dollars! If you played during that season you would start where you last where. You could only have one pass at a time until you are max tier.

Hello everyone, im here and with a new idea. This one isnt really long and its pretty self explenatory but im still gonna show it to you. Lets get to it!

-Free pass reward- 

As everyone knows, there are rewards in the free pass that you can get every 5 tiers. Unfortunately for the F2Ps, they dont have any rewards past tier 65 or so. Its kind of sad because if you do reach more than tier 65 without xp booster or weekly challenges, you deserve to have rewards. What i tought of is to give people who grinds the free pass up to 100 a ""bonus item"". Not a skin or anything big but just a little something to show they did it, like a throwable emote that shows the season number with a #100 beside it. It wouldnt be too big of a deal to give these players a little bonus and i think they deserve it.

Let me know what you think in the comments and if you have any suggestions, let me know! On that, goodbye everybody!",FortNiteBR

I *do* build to cover myself, But I don't know about rushing or build battles.

Before the glider redeploy, I would normally just destroy the structure, Or be forced to spam an SMG.

I'm also not the best at using shotguns.

Any tips?",FortNiteBR

Although you may not agree, I love both Blitz AND Disco. Shouldn't we have just had Disco replace Team Terror?
I mean, they're both team gamemodes and both in fact have 32 players. The only difference is that, in my opinion, Disco is way better for improving AND is overall a fun mode. I mean, you can respawn and practice with weapons...it's a great gamemode, but it shouldn't have replaced Blitz, an absolute fan-favorite.

TL;DR: I want both Blitz and Disco, and I think lots of people would be happy if Disco had replace Team Terror rather than Blitz.

This is where it gets confusing though... I had 500 more vbucks on my account than before. The thing is, you can’t purchase 500 vbucks. I thought maybe the hacker purchased a larger vbuck bundle, then spent some in the item shop,  but NO new purchases were made. Also
Checked my card that was linked to my account and no purchase was made on that. 

Can someone help me make some sense out of this? Do I need to cancel my card? I have just enabled two factor authentication but not sure if this will stop this same hacker in the future.",FortNiteBR

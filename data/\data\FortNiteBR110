0,MrPopoTFS,1548207463,aiuct6,918,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aiuct6/ice_storm_spawn_rate_adjustments/,1,Ice Storm Spawn Rate Adjustments,"Hey folks,

We’ve just released a hotfix to make some adjustments to the spawn rate of the Ice Legion. Previous to this hotfix, spawn rates started low and gradually increased as the match progressed. We’ve now flipped these rates so that more Ice Legion spawn earlier in the game and gradually spawn less as the match progresses.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to this, we’ve also heard your feedback that Golden Brutes were too difficult to find. We apologize for the oversight and have increased the spawn rate of Golden Brutes to a more forgiving level.

&amp;nbsp;

This will give more opportunity to progress through the Ice Storm Challenges earlier in the match while also allowing players in the late game to focus on earning that Victory Royale without having to focus as much on the Ice Legion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Spawn Rate Adjustments**

* Increased the spawn rate of all Ice Legion in the early game.

 * This spawn rate gradually decreases as the game progresses.
  
  * Increased Circle 1 Ice Legion spawns by 100%
  
  * Increased Circle 2 Ice Legion spawns by 20%

* Reduced the spawn rate of all Ice Legion towards the end game.
 
 * Decreased Circle 3 Ice Legion spawns by 80%
 
 * Decreased Circle 4 Ice Legion spawns by 80%

 * Decreased Circle 5 Ice Legion spawns by 80%

* Increased the spawn rate of Golden Brutes by 100%
 
 * This will compound on top of the the spawn rate changes mentioned above.

&amp;nbsp; 

Thanks so much for your feedback, we’ll continue monitoring the effect these changes have. Drop in and let us know what you think!

If I land somewhere that's likely to spawn chests, also likely to have players, the risk of just not getting a gun even if you find a chest seems unreasonable and pointless. 

If for the first minute after you land there's a buff that causes the first chest to drop literally any gun, possibly even restricting the chance for anything higher than green by a lot would this hurt the balance of the game somehow?

I can't think of a single scenario where I'd rather get bandages and a jump pad out of my first chest than literally any gun. 

I even feel as strong as to say that getting anything but a Shotgun, SMG, Pistol or AR as your first weapon puts you at a massive disadvantage early game for no clear reason other than sheer chance.

With the new 7.20 Fortnite update, the Fortnite map has been covered in snow. With the snow being on the map it makes it more challenging to see players using white cosmetics. As we all know, the ""default skins"" in Fortnite consist of green and brown. To me this seems like a disadvantage for the people who dont purchase cosmetics. In a sum of it all, do you think the new map makes Fortnite pay to win? Let me know in the comments. &lt;3

RPGs and and launchers have gotten to the point where the final 3-5 just turns into trying to survive while having multiple rockets shot at you; it's literally whoever has the RPG is already heavily favored to win.  

I understand these items in squads as you have teammates to help you pick someone off if they're focusing you with an RPG or launcher, but in solos you can do absolutely nothing but build and hope to pick up a shot every once in a while.  

If you're not going to remove them, then at least decrease the ammo capacity to something that will discourage at least some players from picking it up.  5, 6, 7, or even 8 would be okay.

Thank you for reading this! And thank you Epic for constantly changing the pace of the game at your own whim, never fixing problems wholeheartedly hated by your community, and -last but not least - never allowing me to feel satisfied with my growth in the game.

(Spent like 30 minutes on this for u/AndrewIsCoolio and others that think the game is now too hard),"Hello as we can see the game is much harder than it was 3 or 4 seasons ago. New players can't get higher rankings (1st place or maybe even 8th). That makes new players rage/quit the game because if its difficulty. Sweats now get easier wins because of defaults just trying to win. My approach idea is to start a new ladder system that can make the match have more people of the same level of skill. My Idea would be to introduce Sweat Points! Sweat points would be some kind of Experience points that you would get by how you play. Similar to actual XP. Sweat Points can make you access higher tiers that would show to your friends how skilled you are without only basing yourself on how many wins you have. 

&amp;#x200B;

**THE ACTUAL IDEA**

**Sweat points** will allow poorly skilled players to stay with poorly skilled players and Sweats to stay with Actual Sweats. The game gives the challenge to both these people. Let's say that a poorly skilled player becomes average. He will go in another section of the matchmaking to set him with other Average players. Get Higher in Sweat points is easier than getting lower. That means that those Youtubers/Streamers that try and lose Sweat points to get some footage to show how ''good'' they are just killing defaults won't work anymore. No more Skin discrimination. **Defaults aren't going to be considered as bad as much as a they are right now.**

&amp;#x200B;

The Idea can still get a lot of changes but the Idea is there. **If you are just going to say gEt bEttEr aT fOrTnUt. Just don't bother on replying. This isn't like back in season 2/3 when ''everyone'' was bad at the game and just started.**

The idea also helps Epic Games since it will allow more players to actually play their game and ''invest'' money in them.

Thank you for your time! I hope you enjoyed the Idea. :D",FortNiteBR

As a player who started in season 5, I joined too late to ever be able to get any good at the game and that's why I only play team rumble now, it's the only fair gamemode. 
Thats because all the main gamemodes don't help me at all, they're just a waste of time.

I'm just tired of getting build battled for no reason and having everyone just straight up tryhard a big noob like me.
It's sad how such a fun game has become this absolute mess. 

Nothing is fair here, and epic won't add a ranked mode or anything to make the skill gap be gone.
All the little 12 year olds playing on a lake full of sweat with their stupid soccer skin or ""og"" skin, this game is only a year old, there's no such thing as an og yet, kid. 
The kills don't matter, everyone is just killing the purpose of the game, which is:

**LAST MAN STANDING WINS**

I may have read it wrong but it doesn't say the one who tryhards the most players and build fights like a dumb fuck the most wins. 

0 kills or 20 kills, it's still a win and you don't get anything for more kills, you still get the same thing for it and you may tell me ""oh but it's last one standing so you obviously want to kill everyone so you are the last one standing"" That doesn't mean you have to kill literally every single player that you see, whether it's a casual or a player you think ""dang he must be good"" when you see them with their gold pump in their hands. 

I myself only build if the player I see has shot me. 
I don't rush people, don't waste materials for nothing, don't play like a tryhards and keep it fair for everyone. 
I just place walls whener I get shot and hope for lucky pump shots and that's the most fair way to play the game imo. 

While other players just go sweat everyone and go like ""oh damn I just saw a little default walking like any other default lemme build a huge fucking hotel with a fancy lobby, wifi and room service and quickly one pump the little guy and leave him no reaction window because Im fucking dumb"" 

If the other player doesn't challenge you, or they don't build back, just stop it and keep it fair. 

Back then people only built to get a quick base or to get up somewhere. Now it feels like you have to build for absolutely anything. The building mechanic is so abused and it's the only thing that makes this game special compared to the other battle royale games and seeing how it's ruined the game for me and a lot of people is just sad. 

I'm obviously going to get downvoted and this might get deleted but while this post lasts, just please take your time to analyze the situation of this game for casuals and new players and you might just realize, MIGHT.

In solos, I keep getting shot by someone who is camping the Ice Shards, and I've only found two golden ones so far - I know many other players have had the same issue (which is why there has been a lot of posts about it). In duos same thing, but it's even harder when your partner tries to grind the ice shard with you and the shard breaks after a while. 

Not to mention the fact that the ice circle keeps being bad for someone who tries to grind the fiends.

I don't know, just some kind of 50v50 or Team Rumble or Disco Domination with ice mode would be cool and really appreciated.

Well that's the question..i would like to know your's opinions becose i think that with this pc i should get 60 fps.  
Lets start with the spec.

CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 2.86 Ghz   
GPU: EVGA GTX 650 SC 1GB  
RAM: 6GB DDR2 Kingstone 800Mhz Dual Channel  
Motherboard: Intel Dge35EC  
Windows 7 64 Bits

I play at 1366 x 768 with all min/disable except view distance on mid.

I recently upgraded mi cpu ( it was a q8300 ) and it get better.Becose that cpu was on bottleneck when i played fornite ( 100%CPU Usage )  
Now i dont get 100% but still i have some drops of fps ( 50 and some times even 40 ).  
Wath could be the cause of that?  
My Cpu is working at 70°C aprox. Max 75°.  
Im waiting 4 2x2gb of ram to get to 8gb.  
and waiting a good psu ( it has a generic 600w ) and im going to buy an antec  VP500P V2 .

I knew right away something was off regarding the lobbies, because my ping/other stats are not bad at all (30-40 ping, and not much packet loss). I’ve also ran into a few twitch and youtubers and when looking at their video/stream, it was clear that they were on PS4. 

To my surprise, I’ve realized a few patches ago or so, Switch players were actually placed into PS4/XBOX lobbies. It’s absolutely crazy that you expect to compete when your switch is barely pushing 30 FPS, along with all the bugs that EPIC hasn’t improved on, on the switch. We’re talking about buildings hardly loading, micro stutters etc. 

Epic, please make Switch modes ONLY Switch lobbies, unless they team up with someone of a different platform. It’s an extreme disadvantage, and I honestly cannot believe there are Switch players out there that still play on the Switch with all the bugs + being put in lobbies that their system cannot even keep up with.

Yes, the golden big boi challenge is hard as it should be, these are challenges not easy freebies. Maybe it's because all other challenges we've received in the past were too easy, I mean the battle pass challenges aren't even this difficult. If you want the glider and the wrap it's gonna be a grind, they're nice items and shouldn't be easy to get. Epic doesn't need to up their spawn rate or lower the amount needed to complete it.

          I also understand that some people don't have the time to grind out these PvE challenges and to be frank that's just unfortunate. Some people have the time and some people don't just like with the battle pass challenges or the 14 days of Fortnite challenges. We're all in the grind together and just because some of us won't be able to complete these challenges doesn't mean that the requirements should change. Good luck to everyone.",FortNiteBR

Granted, it was before the update, so this may be a little more difficult now.  Here is how I did it.

Step One - Drop at an outpost and get weapons.

Step Two - Get a plane

Step Three - Fly along an edge of the map and do flybys of the Ice Zombie Spawners, they will spawn Zombies right as you fly by..  I would fly by as many as i could, then turn and look to see if a golden boi spawned.  If not, I would strafe kill the zombies and repeat.

The reason I said it may be harder today is that they reduced the spawn rate for planes... so, good luck.",FortNiteBR

I am active since the start, I'm 24 and I do not have a lot of time to play since I work 8 hours a day. I never had any issues competing in this game. Yes I got killed a lot but I could deal some damage aswell and feel like I still stand a little of a change with my FPS skills to get the better of an enemy. I am not in a bot, I play shooters since I was little and I am mostly around mediocre/good whenever I play games that involve shooting (like in the COD days). I can build a quick wall/ramp setup and it got the job done.

Now I am getting a little more frustrated at this game for the skillgap. I am trying hard to improve building, but, It's just not sticking since I just play this like a shooter. I get killed almost instant at every encounter, where I had a 50/50 chance at in season 3. I just shoot one bullet and the other guy is building a castle.. 

But, I can only give you guys compliments since you have achieved to get really good at this game, but what bugs me is that I'm not having fun any longer in this game because of the immense skill gap that has formed. 

I'm not calling you guys ''Tryhards'' or ''Sweats'', you guys are better players but I just need to get this off my chest, I want this game to be fun again, I want to feel like I actually can win once in a while again.I want to get matched up with people like me or people I can learn from. I do not learn a lot when I get bodied in like 10secs. 

If you made it all the way here, thank you. I just would like your opinion about this. Do you feel the same? What do you think would need to happen to change this? 

I am worried that I'm not the only ''casual'' feeling like this, that more and more people with the same matching skill will lose interest in the game and leave, leaving the rest of us at the mercy of the better players. Player who have more time on theire hands to improve. ",FortNiteBR

Ever since the trap were up to 150dmg i cannot be happy with them, even when i kill with it. 150 is a little to much IMHO. Traps should to between 105 and 120 dmg, enough to one tap any full health/no shield but not enough to one tap a full HP with 25 shield or bandage HP + 50 shield.  


Even at let's say 115 dmg a trap would one tap some player and when not killing the enemy would still be very low in health and still needing to move away from the trap + healing or fighting with low HP. If you are good enough you can combo your trap dmg with an edit + shotgun shot and BAN it's dead.

By now a lucky few may have managed to kill the 20 golden brutes needed for the wrap. I'm a little late on making this post but I spent all last night getting to 14/20 and now I'm stuck at work. I wanted to go over some of my personal experience and maybe put together a little honor code for fellow hunters.

1. About 8 kills in, I started to do the classic tactic of wait until the plane kicked me out and hover over mid map until the first circle appears. At that point I dive to the safest edge of the circle and begin farming for a weapon.

2. I've tried in all 3 forms of modes. I found duos the best. Solo has your standard try hards (not bashing anyone, I know that’s the point of the game). Squads are okay but I'm not good enough to defend myself from 4 other players if I am discovered. So duos it was and it worked the best for me.

3. A few times I managed to pair up with other hunters. More often than not, when I attempted to play nice, I was gunned down. I recommend stay far away from anyone even if they are hunting as well because people just can't trust one another.

4. CROSSBOW is best!! It’s silent and does insane damage to the mobs.

5. I've read other saying the Golden Boy will spawn during the first circle but honestly I recommend just waiting until that first storm wave has come all the way in and the second circle appears. 

6. If you're like me and are not some GOD mode player, running is a great option. Keep 10 redeploys and maybe even a snow globe to GTFO if someone tries to ruin your grind. I outran so many people last night; I surprised myself with some of my escapes.

7. Maybe as a group we could come up with some uniform to all wear when grinding so we know what each other are doing and can leave one another alone. With this said, I recommend not teaming up too much because if a golden boy does spawn it comes down to who gets the kill. Maybe stay close to each other and find separate pillars to farm.

8. Have fun, I know it's annoying but even if you manage one kill per game, progress is progress. I actually managed to win my first solo squad yesterday doing this. Granted I only have 3 kills and a TON of Zombie score but a wins a win.

Good luck guys, I hope to finish mine in 8 hours when I break free of work. Let's discuss a good outfit as a community.

Im not sure if anyone on this sub really knows what a ""challenge"" is. Usually a challenge is a difficult task. These challenges are difficult for a reason. They shouldn't be done within the first hour of them being released, they should be done gradually while playing. No, you will not find 20 golden brutes in a game.

Imagine if you're in the storm and you run out of your way to get a Quadcrasher because it's the only way you'll make it to the zone, nobody has looted the area, but the Quadcrasher didn't spawn. Because of that, you just died to RNG.

This isn't the way to go, with planes, personally they need a different change, but after all of the recent changes within the past couple patches they're actually not nearly as OP as they used to be.

If you want to limit it, one team to one plane, they shouldn't be able to fly around in 4 different planes and then just go ram into enemies. Quadcrashers were fine just as they were, they didn't need changes. I'd rather have planes and Quadcrashers spawn 100% of the time and deal with annoying vehicle mechanics than die because they didn't spawn because of RNG.

I know someone's going to bring up the argument of ""it's a battle royale there needs to be RNG"", but why is that? What if they could decrease RNG, and make the game more balanced, is that against the rules of a Battle Royale game?",FortNiteBR

I am probably speaking on the behalf of the whole community when I say this challenge should be nerfed. 20 is way too much, and I say that 2 or 3 is a reasonable number.

Or if you don't want to nerf the challenge, increase their spawn rate. I either get killed before one spawns, or one doesn't spawn at all in the match.

With Polar Peek melting and the eventual thawing of the ice storm, what if this excess water turns Paradise Palms into Moisty Mire and creates the old lake at Loot Lake?

TLDR: I would love to see double shotty back in the game, but also not as a game breaking thing since it would require skill to use and it could be countered by other items. And getting atleast pump tac back would give tac a meaning in this meta.

Shortly after this conversation, I was playing some Ghost Recon Wildlands, which in many ways is similar to Fortnite. I realised while playing that my primary weapon is a fix to the problem. Ghost Recon is a third person shooter, but allows you to go FPS while ADS, and this is what the scoped AR needs. A big problem with this mechanic is the time between the transition, and a big reason people hate Scoped ARs. 

&amp;#x200B;

To fix the issue, the scoped AR should be vaulted and replaced with an AR that is equipped with a toggle sight. So after a bit of brainstorming, heres what I came with:

I was like, geez, shut up, I don’t care if I suck, I got the win, that’s it, it’s a game.

I’m in my twenties and I didn’t mind all the stuff and ended up ignoring him tbh, but come on, there’s a lot of people out there playing who are only kids, probably the only way they could kill somebody was if they were indeed standing still so what? As if it was their fault.

My nephew just started playing, he’s really young and gets extremely excited when he gets a kill (which don’t even sum to 5 in like 3 weeks), if he had been the one to have received such message, I’m sure he’d have felt sad and disappointed.

I’ve been playing Fortnite since Season 2 as a casual player ever since, and I believe this game definitely no longer a casual game. 

Everyone I see within my match are practically gods at the game, who clock 8+ hours a day. I barely am able to compete, and my casual friends have outright stopped playing due to the amount of skilled players. They used to have so much fun with the game, everyday we would laugh our asses off and having a blast, now they describe the game as “too sweaty and competitive for my liking” and “annoying and frustrating to play”. 

I’ve tried bringing other friends into the game, and everyone I’ve brought in has said the same thing, too competitive and sweaty. They’re discouraged from even trying the game because it’s too competitive.

Epic needs to do something, eventually they’re going to lose players because of this, which may be already happening. Their idea of the competitive community advertising the game and bringing in money is absurd. We need some form of competitive mode or skill based match making, ANYTHING. ",FortNiteBR

My only chance at competing with these God tier players were getting a Minigun, Quad Launcher, or Plane.

Now, they nerfed the minigun into the ground.  They're removing the Quad Launcher in a couple of days and they're taking out even more planes.

Long story short, I have a significantly worse chance at killing anyone and even less of a chance at winning.  Which by the way, I hardly did prior to these nerfs and removals.

this game is so versatile, that any kind of weapon could work. I have an idea for a slug shotgun that would totally be fine if it was balanced. stop being so negative about stuff, and turn the criticism into it's constructive variant

I personally finished this challenge around 5PM tonight so it took me 3 hours and only about half that was hardcore using this strategy to grind for it. I've also linked an image to my challenges to show that I have in fact completed the challenge. This might be a little long of an explanation so I apologize for that.

&amp;#x200B;

To Start what I did was no matter where the bus was going I dropped and went to Frosty Flights. From there I would loot until I got a crossbow, can take anywhere from 1-5 chests and can even spawn as floor loot, after that just hop in a plane and fly towards the circle. Once in the circle find a ledge that is off the side of the cliff of the main map and land the plane and wait. At this point, I would then wait there until the second circle begins to close, from this point forward if you fly by an Ice Shard they will spawn zombies.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually in order for the zombies to spawn you need to be at about the top of the tree line as the furthest possible point off the ground. As you fly by an Ice Shard rotate the camera to look at the zombies that spawn and see if one spawns. \[Side Note: when a Golden Brute spawns they give off a purple aura rather than the blue or green that standard or elite have respectively so it is fairly easy to spot them when they do spawn. Also when flying by Ice Shards and spawning zombies if you fly roughly 100 meters away from it the zombies will despawn and you can fly back to it to respawn a new round of zombies, this works well if there are 3-4 Ice Shards within close vicinity of each other.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Once you fly past an Ice Shard that does spawn a Golden Brute just hop on out and use the crossbow on them, a brute takes between 14-17 crossbow bolts depending on how many headshots you hit. From there it is pretty self-explanatory. Just hop back in your plane and repeat the previous steps of flying by each Ice Shard you see.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that this method takes a bit of grinding and you will get shot at so focus on building to clock shots and finishing the brutes and if you die and lose at least you got your Golden Brute kill. Best of luck to all of you in destroying your 20 Ice Brutes.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

The Idea is that rather than having the Ice Storm mode taking over normal modes, they would take up one mode slot and swap between Solo/Duo/Squads while also having Team Rumble become Storm Rumble (32v32).

Storm Rumble would be better than a copy of Team Terror as by time you get to the enemy, your team is almost gone in Team Terror.

This idea also allows for the swap out of extra LTMs so that everyone can enjoy other LTMs instead of just Ice Storm.

Hopefully Epic catches wind of this idea so that we can have this updated.

There are two main reasons why I believe it’s the players who have main the game less enjoyable:

1. People play to often an thus it becomes less of a rewarding/exciting experience to get a win or a high kill game. Instead it is more of a daily ritual to play.

2. Players who dedicate their lives to the game are ruining the fun of a levelled playing field experience for newer players which turns them away from wanting to play. This creates a toxic community of sweat lords who think they’re better than everyone else. This kind of mentality often results in an angry xbl message or a steamer calling you bad or trash just because you beat them. This skill gap is something that is unpreventable by epic without the inclusion of something such as Skill Based Matchmaking (which most players don’t want).

While most people blame epic for Fortnite not being as enjoyable as it used to be, it is the extreme fan base that will inevitably turn it into a toxic environment and kill the game.",FortNiteBR

401,itsyaboysharrod,1548125122,aii97q,54,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aii97q/the_genius_behind_tfues_tfault_scrims/,1,The Genius Behind Tfue's Tfault Scrims,"Once upon a time, Tfue didn't have his own scrim discord, and he played in other pro scrim discords, but he got frustrated with it, because people would focus him in games by his infamous default skin, so he decided to finally make his own scrim discord, and one of the rules he put in place was for everybody to wear a default skin so he wouldn't be as noticed or focused. His scrims were first called Peen scrims, but as of today, they're mainly called and known as Tfault scrims.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the 'genius' part about his scrims...

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that people have to sub to him on Twitch in order to join his discord and compete in his scrims is genius enough. But the other genius thing about it, is that it's a great way to grow his sub count drastically, and also KEEP his sub count growing and not dropping, like other Fortnite streamers, who i shall not name, have suffered.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain...

&amp;#x200B;

See, with Tfue being known as the best Fortnite player, and with him just simply...uhh...being 'the man' right now, everybody wanna be apart of what he has going on, so naturally, his scrims has grown in popularity drastically, with not only his regular fanboy subs competing in them, but other pro fortnite players, and popular fortnite streamers competing in them now also. 

The reason why his sub count will continue to grow drastically, is because the fans and fortnite players in general wanna be apart of his Tfault scrims, they see it as a way to be ""included"" in on competing against other pro players, and some of their favorite fortnite streamers. To a lot of people, it's a dream to be in the same game with popular top players, and Tfue scrims give them that opportunity, and to feel included in on something special, instead of being on the outside looking in, like it normally is for the regular player/fan. Also, with other pro players and big streamers competing in his scrims pretty much on a daily basis, it's bringing his Tfault scrims more and more attention, and bringing him more and more subs (money!), and making people wanna be apart of it. Other big streamers be having Tfault in their stream titles now, that's how much of a big deal it's become.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why his sub count will not be dropping off ANY time soon is because of everything i just stated, it goes hand in hand. Fans and people in general, for the most part, will not wanna unsub to him, because they're not gonna wanna lose their ""access"" to his discord, and competing with all the top fortnite gamers. Tfue's Tfault scrims is like VIP access now. You already see how other streamers have adopted Tfue's way of growing subs, by having their own scrim discords, and more will follow his lead.

&amp;#x200B;

And there you go, the genius behind Tfue's Tfault scrims. I predict that he's going to have over 100k subs in the next couple months, and it's only going to grow from there, unless Fortnite dies.... which won't be happening any time soon.",FortNiteBR

1. Many ways to play: It's an ongoing battle where at times your base is getting pushed and you need to go back and defend, or your team is making a strong push to their base and you want to come along. Not only that, you have the freedom to construct your base the way you want to. I've had so many matches where people built booby-trapped laced metal labyrinths and defended them. Other times, we go full offense and infiltrate their side, and construct our own safehouses in their base and damage their mascot safely for as long as possible. The best part is, I usually go back and forth between the two and it keeps things engaging.
2. Objective actually matters: Unlike Disco Domination, the objective isn't a chore, and it's presented in a fun and impactful way. In Disco Domination, the Dance platforms are so far away from the action that it forces players to choose to either isolate themselves away from battle to try to win, or to just keep battling and having fun and ignore the objective. Food Fight doesn't make that mistake. In the LTM Teams of 20, you have people going off in their own little groups and each game can be wildly different depending on how well your team actually works together. In Food Fight, the objective is clear and concise, so it's much easier to work with teammates.
3. Well balanced: Out of all the large team LTM games, this is the most balanced among them. There's not very many one-sided blowouts like you see in Team Rumble. I can't tell you how many games of Rumble I've played and netted 20 kills and still lost by a substantial margin. Food Fight was also updated from 12v12, to 16v16 which was a great improvement because a few players missing from either team won't instantly make a huge difference anymore, while keeping the action at a constant pace.
4. Great Practice: This one is self explanatory; you can choose whatever weapons you want to practice with, and practice engagements against the enemy, respawn, and do it all over again. Since it's 16v16, it's not chaotic as a 100 player LTM is, so you won't get mercilessly 3rd partied every time you fight. It's perfect for all types of players, and those quick battles where you weave your builds/ edits while shooting, as well as ranged practice because there's always people scattered around to shoot. Furthermore, each match is set in a different location, and utilizing the natural terrain makes things even more interesting (except that time where a base spawned inside a mountain...).

I've always played Food Fight solo and had a blast. Epic did an outstanding job creating and balancing this LTM. The objective matters and it's incorporated into the core of the mode without detracting from the action one bit. If you haven't tried this game mode because streamers don't play it, do yourself a favor and drop in the next time it's available. You will be pleasantly surprised how fun it is.",FortNiteBR

Even if shotguns could still easily destroy builds, double pump was slow enough to the point where you didn't even need turbo building to outbuild it.  Even at the end of season 4 it was generally accepted that pump + tac smg was the more reliable weapon combo, but double pump was still an option for people who wanted to do it. Nevertheless, people still complained and Epic still added the shotgun timer at the beginning of season 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at [this old clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9q997v/found_this_season_2_clip_that_shows_the_pure/) clip for a minute. Notice how that entire squad stood still and didn't build one structure, and still in the comments people are saying ""wow, double pump was op"". Like no shit, that was a squad full of bots, they deserved to be wiped.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine for a minute if double pump was never a thing back then and was just discovered now. What would people say about it? Nowadays, the average player is better at building, and an smg or AR is much better for shredding builds. If there were no shotgun timer, I'm sure plenty of people would still pick up a p90 or deagle to destroy builds (I myself really like the deagle now).",FortNiteBR

This beeing so heavily disliked among this community (myself including),  I've decided to post my pointers on how to complete this event the quickest and easiest way possible.

1. Land as Far away from the **BUS ROUTE** as you can. Fly for a minute if you have to zombies don't spawn till than anyway. Land on a place with some loot tho, nowadays you can gear up fairly quickly anywhere on the map. But aim for a place with 3 or more chests, to increase your crossbow drop chance.  

2. **Crossbow**, it's so much faster and so much **QUIETER**. Like seriously it one shots the thin ones and two shots the fat ones.  

3. Look for two Zombie Spawners and stand inbetween. As soon as you start hitting zombies they will move towards you. Although don't waste too much time trying to find them perfectly alligned, I've only been lucky twice, having two close in range.  

4. Ignore any shield drops you don't need that crap, YOU are here to farm the zombies to complete the challenge and go back to a regular **PVP** content. And you'll be at full shield all the time anyway since you're killing them like crazy.  

5. **Rift-to-GO** \&gt; any other item/weapon. As soon as some sweat tries to ruing your **'FUN'** , fly away and let him deal with whatever zombies were chasing you at the time. And when you fly away aim towards the edge of the next safe zone, away from the popular POI's.  

6. You will definitely get an AR/Pistol/Explosive drop from the zombies so don't even bother wasting your bag-space for that, but get some **HEALS**, for those times when a Soccer Skin will try to show his superiority and actually get a few hits on you. I recommend Purple Slurps or Medkits.  


Following those simple 6 rules i've completed the  5/6 challenges within 4 games in less than 40 min's, averaging around 150-200 zombie kills per game. And about the **Golden Ice Brutes** , Wouldn't bother trying to grind them you'll only get frustrated, go back to killing other players and if you see one, even in the storm, just go for it because from what i understand they are **VERY RARE**. I only got 1  so far, and the whole reddit is crying about them.

I've found two ways that worked, and you can try either. They may take a couple of tries. 

1. I selected a backpack, then quickly hit *shuffle*, moved over to *none* and pressed A.

2. I selected *none*, moved over to *shuffle* and selected that, and back to *none* and hit A a third and final time. 

Both of these worked for me and I was able to recreate it multiple times.

Hope this helps! *Cheers*",FortNiteBR

There’s been a lot of suggestions that the merry marauder will be making an appearance in the store, which I hope this isn’t the case. 

I’ve only purchased a single skin the whole time I’ve been playing fortnite and can’t even afford the battle pass. The gingerbread man is the only thing that makes me content about the various other skins I can’t have. 

Probably a lot of people on this subreddit are hoping for the returns of the skull trooper and other rare outfits. I have no issues with re releasing skins during the same season but not a skin that was released 6 months ago.

Coming back for the starting of seasons 5 the game just isn't the same. Double pumping and really using two shotguns just isn't viable anymore. Now the whole meta supports using a pump, SMG, and a bolty. Building is nerfed with multiple utility and weapons desgined to destroy it with no skill involved. People who get out built in a ramp race can now build around the person from below and place two traps which each do 150 damage! That's insane! A new game mode is coming out which is reduced mats with a whole emphasis on building managment, but it seems to really just be to let people who can't build have a slither of a chance. The game really doesn't force new players to get better or to improve anymore. It's a horror show of 'metas', broken updates, copy paste emotes and skins and players complaining about certain things. The game really isn't the same anymore and with Islands of Nye now out this game just isn't worth it anymore.

So I guess something like that makes sense from epics perspective because the casual players can win some rounds as well because they don't play with extremely skilled fortnite beasts and all ....

The last 6 games in a row I have died to the Drum Gun. One of them, the one that got me to write this post in particular, I got a rare tactical shotgun right off the bat, and I thought to myself: ""Sweet! The best close range weapon in the game!"" 2 minutes later, (I had atleast 400 materials) I saw a guy pick up an uncommon Drum gun and I started firing at him. (It was a default, though that doesn't change much.) I fired at him and missed, so I decided to push him because he didn't seem to be building. All the odds were in my favor. Or so I thought. He wasn't building as I mentioned earlier,  I had the height advantage, and he seemed to have decent to bad weapons. I jumped at him and hit him once in the head at point blank and once a bodyshot from a decently long range (for a tactical shotgun.), but by then I had lost all my 100 shield, so I decided to put myself in a box and take 2 mini shields. As I was taking my shields, he pulls out the drum gun and starts spraying, and within his 50 round magazine, I lost my 250 remaining materials from replacing my walls, and I had also died from only 3 of the bullets. I had finished one of my small shield potions, leaving me at 100 health. 

  I think the Drum gun was an awful idea from the start. The LMG is only balanced because of its extremely severe recoil. The fact that it has a 100 round ammo capacity wouldn't really matter if it was nerfed to say, 50 bullets or so if it had less recoil, possibly? The Drum gun is the only weapon that overpowers everything else. They removed double shotgunning because it was vastly superior to any single close range weapon, including the Drum gun! I guess what I'm trying to say is that by removing the double shotgunning tactic, they've just simply created the next double pump. ",FortNiteBR

Suggestions:

1. Nerf splodes.  C4 blast radius needs a nerf and I think it might be time to add damage fall off to all other explosives. 

2. Revert shotgun switch time or shotgun damage.  If I can’t use two shotguns anyway, what’s the point of that gun pulling out slower than all of the others?  It’s overkill

3. Add damage drop off against structures for ARs.  It was taken away a few patches ago, switch it back.

4. Increase drum gun reload time and increase bloom.  In a game with Scars, MP5s, tactical SMGs, the drum gun shouldn’t reign supreme

5. If you won’t adjust suggestions 3 and 4, add the extra 10 materials to floor drops

here are some bugs and suggestions that the mobile community has for the game:


[CONFIRMED BY EPIC]

- [ ] add pro builder mobile controls (concept below)
- [ ] sprinting cancels crouch option on all platforms
- [ ] add option to use 3D touch to shoot


PRO BUILDER CONCEPT:

- [ ] separate button for wall, ramp, floor, and roof piece (can be customized)

One of the major keys to being successful is never giving up in failure but improving on your mistakes after every failure. But people have recently been give up after much failure or any at all. 

So how does Fortnite or BR games in general help with this? Well your main goal is to win right? Every game no matter what you're doing whether its a one chest challenge or full try hard, your end goal is to win. When you don't win you usually just que for another game even after a bit of frustration when that pump hits for 9 damage. People play hundreds sometimes thousands of matches but have only several wins. Most of them are improving they probably are placing higher than they used to, or they have a better K/D now, they could be building better. Maybe nothings improved because they fail to see their mistakes. Its much like a business you fail hundreds maybe even thousands of times and those willing to see their mistakes and keep on going are the businesses that are going to be successful. But if  If you can't make that adjustment to change yourself and see your mistakes you're never going to be successful. You're not going to get those victory royales and you're not going to become a multi-millon or even a multi-billion dollar business. So those people who are improving every game are being put into a mindset that if I just keep on keeping on I will eventually reach my goal I just got to keep working on X and eventually Y will improve, whether it takes me a day, an hour, or even a year it will improve.

This is just my perspective on the subject I'd love for any criticism from you guys or to hear any of your guys perspectives on this.

I currently have 77 solo wins, 45 wins being from season 4 and 1 solo win being from season 5. Starting about 3 weeks ago or so i started getting into streaming and enjoyed it before streaming i didn't play solos as much but when streaming i started playing solos more, i used a daily stat tracker overlay on my stream and in the 2 to 3 hours i streamed i would get 3-7 solo wins depending on how long i played solos and if i went to duos or squads for some time, and everything was good... but recently ***(5ish days ago)*** it seems like SO many people are just trying so hard their sweating their balls off, i mean its not even funny at this point. So often when im fighting people they just pencil warrior ***(meaning they are so focused on building higher even when they have high ground that they dont shoot)*** and either they kill me because 1) they phase through my floor/wall 2) they sit on top of my box spamming me with the FUCKING drum gun/ smg which needs a HUGE nerf on their dmg to buildings 3) happens 5&amp;#37; of the time but it is actually a good fight and they win or i win. Also this started happening the second season 5 came out and shotguns got nerfed, but EVERYONE is carrying around a SMG( suppressed, tactical, or drum-gun) or an RPG so either i die bcuz i got spammed into oblivion. or to an RPG cuz the new update when it blows up ANYTHING in its radius ands its way to OP. Also at this point it feels like 90&amp;#37; of build battles if the enemy knows what their doing, whoever has the high-ground its ALMOST impossible to get it back, bcuz enemys will spam me. Also for some reason i have started to get double and triple teamed in solos, and that ticks me off the most! the enemys dont even go for each other at all they all just spam me from every angle. Also when i rush someone its very annoying bcuz bloom is NEVER on my side so i take the first shots and hit the first shot accuracy one and the others go everywhere but the person. Lastly is it just me or does anyone else feel like when u shotgun someone u do like NO damage but then they turn around and hit you SO much or one-shot you. And for the people who are going to be like its because you bad get good, or YOUR bad my stats are better than yours, Save it i dont care if your better than me.

I think this new system would be effective but only if it also applies retroactively to the Omega skin.

This might seem like a solution-- but you've made the Omega lights an EVEN more rare outfit. Now this will be the only unobtainable progression unlock in Fortnite history, and it will serve as an increasingly rare skin along the lines of skull trooper (unless it is brought back for this year), but even worse.

Personally, it's quite depressing that I wasn't able to unlock the Omega lights. Epic games has masterfully woven an experience of collection to the game, and I appreciate that.

 But in some sense I feel like my account is **permanently** tainted.

Like I've made a mistake that can never be fixed unless I pay thousands of dollars for an account that isn't even mine. Over a game that I was passionate about and couldn't feel bad about.

That's ridiculous.


I consider myself quite a dedicated player but I wasn't able to play during the last ~month of the season (other obligations IRL), and wasn't able to achieve it.

I know people will see it as begging but it really does make me sad every time I log in. Dwelling on something in the past instead of enjoying Season 5 like I should be.

It sure as hell is frustrating dying to one pump from full health, but what it gave players was some form of lethal pressure. Similar to how you shouldn't stand still out in the open for snipers to punish you, you shouldn't let someone get that window of opportunity to comfortably one pump you.

**The """"""""meta"""""""" right now is certainly interesting. I find myself using all weapons and them all feeling viable.** However, I find in most fights that no matter the skill gap, you **can't really shut someone out early**. You need to be exposed to each other for quite a bit to land damage.

This gives more opportunities for people to turtle in situations they deem ""uncomfortable"", buffer fights with building-

In earlier versions building was used far more as a *mobility* tool to swiftly get your ""one pump angle"" before the other guy did. If you were able to do it, game over, you win the fight. It still is like that, but now that fights require lots of shots and ""exposed time"" to each other, both parties take *some* damage during that fight, while also blowing their mats.

**Every fight has become a war of attrition.** Who can outlast the other? Who runs out of mats first? Who runs out of heals first?

Yes, you do get fights where you can the other person in a second flat with a heavy headshot and double tac smg headshots, but most people buffer the shit out of fights with building. Because now that you need to land damage for a longer time without being shot back, people prioritize continously building till they get a surprise angle rather than engage head on by betting on a good shot.

This ""slow gameplay"" leaves people in areas for a longer time, allows more people to join in on the fight and wipe out the low mat/ health users. Out of every multi-person fight I've had, the **last guy to join the fight hands down always wins.**

Unless the lobby is full of really bad players, you can't conceivably take on the pressure of 5 people.

On top of all this, the only ""insta-kill punishing tactic"" out there is sniping. I've seen a SIGNIFICANT increase in people sniping. Both to gain an advantage in a fight/ get the insta-kill without a fight, OR more annoyingly from camping in high areas.

What does this all mean? Fortnite has become what the ""competitive"" version of it looks like: low kill games with high amounts of camping and preserving mats. I see hardly *anyone* at previously high activity rotation hotspots- everyone is opting to avoid the hell out of fights and be in unconventional locations so they can avoid confrontations.

Of course this is a battle royale game, and you should be doing that anyway. But I'm not entirely a fan of the last guy to enter a confrontation having a HUGE advantage for having other opponents play a war of attrition.

Since fights don't end instantly and lead to most people turtling + using their heals up during a fight, aggressive gameplay is not rewarding whatsoever.

One shot pump shotguns were aggravating, but that lethal pressure was something interesting to work with. Certainly more interesting and dynamic than the ""hold out till everyone finishes fighting and join"" or ""camp and snipe from a tower on a mountain"" approach.

This is an theory of what might happen in s5, please take it with an grain of salt.

In Norse mythology Ragnarok is an event that is known as the end of times.
One of the most remarkable events of Ragnarok is the death of Thor, the god of thunder.
If you look closely at the Ragnarok skin I game, it kind of looks like Thor. Think about it.
Now after what happened, let’s take a look back at the leviathan. People said the leviathan will come and the detectives have a drawing of it. Right? 
Ragnarok begins when the Midgard serpent rises from the sea. (Correct me if I’m wrong). 

After Ragnarok, the world will be reborn it is told.


So my theory is that the leviathan will come. And that Ragnarok is Thor. And that there will be an final epic battle at the end of s5 where Thor will die and the fortnite map will be reborn in some kind.

to begin with, i can definitely give a big pat on the back for epic listening to their fan base, but people on reddit give a lot of suggestions, and A LOT of them tend to be trash that ruins the game for better/more dediacted players. cosmetic suggestions are fine, but LEAVE THE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS TO EPIC  
* MATERIALS: we can all agree that the material nerf sucks. i shouldnt have to spend ~7 minutes farming so i can have a chance at putting up a fight. an 800hp tree drops 48 wood. **48**. thats enough to build two ramps with walls at the end of them. this game needs materials, its the only way its going to live. just because trash builders complain that ""building is all this game is about"", epic felt the need to nerf floor mat drops, and now everyone is paying the price for it. this is epic trying to make the game cover the low end of the skill scale, which im gonna come back to at the end 
* SKINS: one of the reasons why i personally played so much last season was because i wanted to get to level 80 to grind for omega, and i did without an issue. the problem arises when people who dont make it to level 80 feel the need to bitch at epic because they couldnt get the lights on him. its not supposed to be fucking easy. you dont even need to put in effort into this season, because all you need to do is get to tier 100 and the XP you can get in later seasons. this completely destroys the incentive to keep playing  
* OTHER USELESS SHIT: just because you can use photoshop to make pretty pictures of your idea doesnt mean you should submit it. i see suggestions that literally make me facepalm, ie: [this...](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yee1q/i_feel_like_epic_missed_an_opportunity_here_to/) 7k upvotes? do you seriously think epic has nothing better to do than add some dumbass banner icon onto a cart that gets used for a minute of an entire game? there are plenty more examples but i cant be bothered to look for them.  
* GENERAL BITCHING: if youre bad at the game, its not the end of the fucking world. every pro player was at the point you are now, so just keep playing and stop blaming the game for your deaths unless its an actual bug  
**message to epic:** i understand taking suggestions from players, but just because something gets upvoted a lot DOESNT MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED. trying to cater to every person in the world, even ones who have never touched games before, will kill your game. dumbing the game down makes it less enjoyable. so learn to filter suggestions, or dont take them at all and take over your game again and direct it to where YOU want it, because thats the reason why the game is at the point it is now. it all started with you

The spokesperson quoted, ""In season 5, progressive outfits will be based on experience and can be completed outside of the season."" This made me think of the Omega lights. I made it to level 79 with 9k exp left to go. I feel as though Epic should bring back the Omega progressive challenges, but the challenges will only be accessible by people who originally had the Omega. The excuse, ""The Omega lights are supposed to be Season 4 exclusive,"" doesn't really make any sense since you can take your time on Season 6 progressive skins. Please Epic, you came out and said, ""The main concern people didn't feel the had enough time to complete them,"" so why don't you bring back the Omega progressive challenges back? ",FortNiteBR

Especially the parts by the river that are just surrounded by towering red rocks. Fortnite has always had some beautiful landscapes, but the developers really outdid themselves with this entire area. It's like getting a hug from a giant sunset every time I take a step.

Besides the visual appeal, it also makes me feel like I am in an entirely new game in the best way. The newer additions (Tilted Towers, Salty Shores, Haunted Hills) were great fun, but they still matched the typical color schemes, decor styles, and so on. The desert biome, however, feels like a completely different planet, and it's the first part of the map that simply feels rewarding to explore. 

In the past when I saw posts suggesting different biomes, I was against them due to the lack of ""realism"" it would create. I figured there was no way that the developers could blend different biomes onto the map in a ""realistic"" enough way, and that it would look sloppy in-game. And I was right-- the desert biome is blended in horribly, particularly on the minimap. But actually being inside the desert has made me do a complete 180 on that position; it just makes the map so much more interesting and varied. I'd love to see an arctic biome, a jagged mountain range, a jungle, and whatever else they can come up with. 

How do you guys all feel about the new addition? ",FortNiteBR

1: ability to see challenges in game (without having to complete part of it).

2: skin/ other locker item trading with an online trading system where you can trade with anybody by looking up there offer or what the want for it.

3: World's Collide ltm when save the world becomes free where there are stw husks roaming the battle Royale map.

4: Anniversary ltm where you play on the pre season one map with all the og weapons and items so new players can get the ability to experience just how much fortnite has changed.

5: Playground v2 with the fallowing new options:
5a: Ability to disable the zone completely   allowing you to have fun untill you want to quit
5b: Ability to stay in the game even if one of your teammates leaves
5c: ability to have infinite ammo and mats
5d: ability to team with a person and see there map location, also you are unable to friendly fire. This would allow better 2v2s etc.
5e: increase Max players 8 or 16 maybe
5f: allow invited players or friends to join in your playground game without needing to wait untill it's over if you haven't reached Max players yet.

6: (this one is really personal) move snobby a tiny bit Eastward and make the area behind it more beach like with a boardwalk and water bar.

7: make it so you don't have to wait through the br que when trying to load into the not so crowded stw.

8: Buff the hand cannons damage at long range so it's less affected by damage dropoff (also the revolver)

9: add one week were you are able to refund any item you've gotten so mistakes made months before refunds came out can be fixed.

10: add an emote where you slam down a bannar  flag with your player icon on it and a glider which is a plastic bag maybe says ""thank you for shopping at noms"" on it.

11: add a reward for winning either vbucks or the highly requested ticket store

12: give the Viking place and the new Alamo looking town names (I mean there significantly larger than tomato so why not) 

13: fix the bug where one player would get left behind in the lobby and there teammates loaded in without them 

If any of this happened I would be very happy:
Please comment anything you would change, add, or remove.

And not catering enough to the better players, the 100+ wins kind of players that can build and can fight well and have a better understanding of the game.

There are a lot of popular opinions from the vocal casual side of the community that are being let through which I do not blame Epic as a lot of game companies are letting these kind of things through now-a-days but I also believe that they should not.

ok im done with the fancy language, its time to get real
i play this game for a lot of hours daily, and i am upset, that, in, the new season the upgradeable ragnarok can be upgraded past this season. i do not want to see ragnarok become another john wick where everyone looks the same and you cant distinguish between the idiots and the good ragnaroks the lvl 65+ ragnaroks with the skull heads. now the lvl 40 ragnaroks will be able to get a cool skull head

i liked omega because the cool omegas, the ones with the helmet and the colours and lights aka 65+ could be distinguished from the john wick omegas with no mask.

and while i may have been joking a wee bit in the post and taking it to extremes, i genuinely believe that epic should cater equally to casuals and better players as my favourite game, WoW is being damaged heavily by casuals, ok, cya, pls share your opinion and downvote if you want but i believe that is a wee bit, childish, like this post",FortNiteBR

As Donald Mustard (Creative Director at Epic Games) said in [the ""Worlds Collide"" E3 coliseum panel with Joe Russo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rejfgOU9xc&amp;feature=youtu.be), Season 4's meteor was something the team simply placed on top of the island to see how the players would react. Than, after analyzing our theories they developed Season 4's story line for us, the fans.

Honestly, I think that was a pretty amazing feat. We did that. We created Dusty Divot. We created that amazing adventure.

But *now...*

*Processing img ecfif8c14r911...*

And with Season 5, comes the confirmation of [my previous theory](https://new.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vc62x/the_island_isnt_protected_by_a_shield_the/), the tearing of the space-time continuum! And with that comes an incredibly unique story-line. On the E3 coliseum panel previously mentioned, Donald Mustard said he told Joe Russo the entire plot for Season 5, which means they won't be improvising as the month goes by.

Which is a real shame, but that doesn't mean they won't be able to modify the story according to our feedback.

Now that I got all of that out of the way, let me explain everything that happened, and refresh your knowledge on the island's story.

* **The rifts will continue to show up around the island, yet we're not sure if they'll ever disappear.**

 This is a big deal. We're not sure if the rifts created by The Visitor's escape will be gone, as it's an easy way to introduce new Seasonal Themes on the game. We're also unaware of the nature of the rift, as the alien didn't leave any traces of his technology behind.

* **With the rifts, comes new map changes and gameplay features!**

In the new update, Epic created THREE brand new Points of Interest for us to explore! Let's go through each one, and explain what time periods they belong to.

*Processing img q2vn8b0b5r911...*

\---

**Paradise Palms / The Desert Biome**

https://i.redd.it/v0pvvsje6r911.jpg

Gameplay:

Replacing Moisty Mire and it's prison, while giving a brand new look to the Race Tracks, comes a brand new Desert Biome! This biome contains multiple periods squeezed inside.

This includes a Wild West village, Dinosaur statues and modern architecture on the Race Tracks and Paradise Palms itself.

It's safe to assume that most of the rift's consequences were sent towards the Southeast section of the island for unknown reasons, most likely gameplay.

Lore:

This confirms the existence of Dinosaurs and the Wild West area on the Fortnite universe. These confirmations will lead somewhere, I promise.

\---

**The Viking Village**

*Processing img zq853k6d6r911...*

Gameplay:

This is a masterpiece. I absolutely ADORE this (unfortunately unnamed) location! The ship's Llama design, the amount of weapons and chests spread around each house. It's lovely, and pays respect to the time period it belongs to! 

Lore: In terms of lore, this confirms the existence of Vikings on the game's time-line, which continues to show extraordinary resemblance to ours!

\---

**Lazy Links**

*Processing img fuvcer5c7r911...*

Gameplay:

Designed to be your cliché rich person's golf club. Contains a swimming pool, golfing courses and a mansion.

Lore:

This is a bit confusing to me lore-wise, and I'll explain that in the end of this post.

\---

So, we're done exploring all of the new major Points of Interest! Now, there's one gameplay feature which I would like to talk about.

**Rifts**

https://i.redd.it/scsnfnwv7r911.jpg

Now... *sigh...*

These things.

They're the sole reason why I haven't been really enjoying this whole story arc for the game. This is gameplay in a nutshell. It doesn't make ANY sense as to why a rift in space-time would simply lift you upwards.

Trust me, I LOVE these in-game, they're an amazing opportunity to give you some easy high ground when necessary, but lore-wise, they don't make any sense at ALL.

\---

# CONCLUSION!

Congratulations! You made it to the end of my wall of text!

Gameplay wise, this Season is 10/10 in my book. It brings many new features that I thought were impossible to implement seamlessly in a Battle Royale game.

Lore wise, here comes the explanation of this entire season. Before it's release, I thought a divergence occurred between the Fortnite universe and OUR universe, similar to what happened in the Fallout franchise.

Turns out that's probably false! We find many things very similar to our modern world in this update, such as Lazy Links.

Now, what can we expect within the next few weeks?

More rifts will start to appear, and more updates will be made on the island. Not just for gameplay, but for the lore as well. More items such as the Easter Island Statues will begin to appear, and with them, more of those gameplay-based rifts. (I'm interested in that Road Trip fellow, by the way... he seems rather important for the island's story, being another challenge skin. I'll be sure to keep you guys updated on him.)

Thank you for reading my post. I'll make sure to come back to it on the next few weeks to add more information and fix some errors for you, folks.

Have a nice day!",FortNiteBR

With that being said, here are my questions:

1. Am I able to fully upgrade the character if this season ends?

2. How long does it usually take to get the max upgrade on the character?

Shotgun. I've decided to make this thread for people looking to grind the Season 5 Drift Stages as it takes a total of 200,000 XP to get Stage 5, which at first, I thought was absurd, but I've been blowing through it pretty quickly being at Stage 3 already without playing duo/squads, only solos. 

**LEVELING/XP GUIDE :**

Here's the Checklist for leveling up as quickly as possible in Season 5,

**- Play Squads with FRIENDS that OWN the Battlepass** ✔

**- Get as many KILLS as possible EACH GAME** ✔

**- Survive till AT LEAST TOP 3 for PLACEMENT XP** ✔

**- WIN games** ✔

**- Have FUN, BUT... GO FOR #1 Victory Royale at the SAME TIME** ✔

**- Get as many REVIVES as you possibly can, it's not much XP, but it certainly STACKS UP after a while...** ✔

**- Similar to PLACEMENT XP, SURVIVAL TIME is also a GREAT way to get XP... THAT DOES NOT MEAN SIT IN A BUSH TILL THE FINAL CIRCLE...** ✔

**SQUAD RECRUITS \[BATTLEPASS ONLY\] :**

If you are looking for people to grind the Battlepass with, if so... then this is the thread for you. No friends? No problem! If you have the Season 5 Battlepass **(THIS IS ONLY FOR SEASON 5 BATTLEPASS OWNERS)**, just leave your **Epic Games Display Name + Console** to receive the most out of your Battlepass, as you get have those lovely moments in a Shopping Cart or even the **NEW** All Terrain Kart (ATK) when you ""drive-by"" spraying down all enemies that dare cross your path on the road to **#1 Victory Royale**!

Auto-fire was added on this update and it is RUINING the game!,"Like the title says, auto-fire was added on mobile and it is labeled as the ""recommended"" setup. Initially I thought it would be okay, I've played other mobile games with it and it worked. But after ten seconds on the spawn island, I realized it wasn't going to help so I disabled it. Problem solved right? Wrong. Less skilled players that don't know a lot are keeping it on.

Now, imagine turning a corner with a shotgun and your crosshairs dragging across someone. It will take you a little to see them and then respond right? Well, auto-fire gets rid of that reaction time. You can literally have your gun start shooting before you realize you are aiming at an enemy. Fun right? Wrong. Most of the time the players using auto-fire don't even win because they don't build or just stand there. BUT, they do manage to do some damage to you that they wouldn't have done without it. Then you are stuck healing up when a more skilled player sneaks up after hearing the gunfire and finishes you.

This is not about preying on the weak. With no extra XP after the first kill there is no need to stack kills on mobile (plus our stats aren't monitored). This is about enjoying the game like we did. No one asked for auto-fire. Most at r/Fortnite_Mobile agree with this and have made posts but if you guys can help it get traction here, Epic can see it. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

Don't get me wrong, but its state at the moment is too strong. They are fine in solo, you can counter them by pushing the enemy, but that doesnt work the same on squads and duo.. one throwing C4 at your squad while the others shoot at you. This is almost not possible to counter except you are a god who can snipe like a boss. I think a game takes skill to master, yes, but weapons and features should also be fair to the casual players. we had a squad on us with C4 and we didnt even have a chance, cause building doesnt work, and other people shoot at you, i mean, what you gonna do? People complained about the Guided missile being OP in squads, but C4 isnt? its the same principle.

• ***Grenade- and Rocket Launchers***

Okay, so, this is a tough one. Lets begin with the Grenade Launcher. Having such a giant Radius is cool and all, but Grenades from the grenade launcher are just unpredictable. You can build like crazy and all you want, but ONE GRENADE IS GONNA HIT YOU SOMEWAY. The Grenade Launcher is strong as it does 100 Damage per Grenade Right now. In my Opinion the Grenade damage should get lowered down a bit. You can just spam them and if shot correctly one is always going to hit. Secondly, DOUBLE GRENADE LAUNCHER. I saw a clip of Svennoss lately and it was the Craziest thing I ever saw. This can't be countered as you can't build that fast. In Squad it is blatantly OP. Let's get to the Rocket Launcher. Rocket Launcher in their current state are good. You only have 13 Rockets and have to spend them wisely. Rockets can be countered, and the damage is fine. Double Rocket Launcher isn't that op either cause you have to Reload both after one double shot. So, nice job on that Epic.    

# 2 - Materials

***• Llamas***

Oh boy, materials, the big one. The Llama change was the most unneccesary thing ever. Finding a Llama was a rare thing and the loot was definitely worth the rarity. Not everyone gets a llama! Yes, 500 was alot, but 200?? i would increase it atleast to 300/350 materials. A llama is rare and now it doesnt feel as good as it once did.

• ***Material Drops on Floors/Chests***

This is the most annoying change ever. We need these Materials for the early game. The change doesnt seem like much, but it changes alot. Early game ""Mini Build Fights"" are over now that you dont have any materials. I remember when you left a city you had a good amount of wood and a bit of stone and a bit of metal. Now, you have ok amount of wood and almost no stone and a no metal. 

The Rest of the materials are fine, i guess. You have to Farm if you want mats for the late game.

# 3 - SMGs

• ***Silenced SMG***                

The SMG Buff was very much needed. SMGS are useful now and are nice to use. But the silenced SMG... Wow. The damage output is extremely high. Shotguns look like paper next to that thing. This is how the Fight look now:

You shoot your pumpgun, deal a good amount of damage. But then, in between the shooting cooldown, the enemy LASERS you down in milliseconds. !?!. Thank god they nerfed it a bit in the 5.0 Update. But still, many people still use a Blue Silenced rather then a SCAR, because they are just weak next to the little SMG. I think now that the silenced SMG is very accurate, the damge should also put back to the old Damage. 

• ***Tommy Gun***

This gun is very good. The Damage is high, and the Ammo capacity is enormous. In my opinion the damage is too high. Headshot damage 54? With a ammo capacity of 50 and such a high fire rate? If you don't want to nerf the damage, alright, but then reduce the building damage. Now with the Low amount of mats Epic buffs/adds things that shred through your Walls like its paper. Something has to be done about it, Epic.

# 4 - Gameplay

• ***People jumping through walls***    

I don't know if this can be fixed, or how it can be fixed, but if its possible it should be fixed... its unfair if a some ninja jumps through your floor that you just built and gives you a fat headshot, just because your Toe was inside the wall.

• ***Old Music***

I was buying VBucks for my account so I could purchase the battle pass, I tried buying the standard 1000VBucks plan and I got an error like transaction declined or transaction wasn't processed please contact support. I try once again and it didn't work, after that I tried like 2 more times and it still didn't work. I restarted Epic Games Launcher, Fortnite, I had no VPN on and the same error is occuring. I checked my bank account and they have taken 4 payments from my account, I do not have a lot of money at the moment so I guess that is the reason to why it didn't take more.

[This](https://i.gyazo.com/28fda7b144f464218452a62645d12102.png) is a screenshot from my bank account from my banks app. Now this is not the only problem, I haven't even recieved my VBucks! I do not have any money to purchase this again so I have to wait for Epics long waiting time on their support.

(The money in the screenshot is in Swedish Krona)

Note this is not even the first time this has happened, it happened when I was going to buy the Radiant Striker when it was first in the shop. It took 2 weeks for me to get an answer and another week to get my money back.

I am not asking for upvotes so that I can get Epics attention. I am asking for upvotes since this is unacceptable and this has even happened to a friend of mine aswell. I can not believe that a company like Epic Games would be such rookies when it comes to support. Why not have a live chat for people asking for refunds so that you can prioritize the people that need the help. I am now without money and I can't do anything.

TLDR;

I wanted to buy VBucks for the battlepass. I tried buying the 1000VBucks plan and I got error upon error, after trying multiple times I recieved no VBucks but Epic Games charged my 4 times according to the logs on my bank account.

So many of you complained regarding maxing Omega, so Epic is now allowing you to progress the skins after the season is over. I wasn’t happy about this change, however, I’m glad they listened to the majority of the player base. Yet, some of you still find other things to complain about, simply because you believe Epic’s reddit team will work to appease *every single one* of your needs. They don’t have to give you everything on a silver platter. You’re not going to like every single thing about each season, and honestly, I don’t know who will. The point is variety, so that everyone can enjoy a little something each season.

Expecting top tier best-of-the-best content with every move Epic makes is an easy way for their dev team to *not* want to provide the player bases with so many updates and future content, especially when it’s met with ungrateful comments/posts (*4.5k upvotes for a post complaining about two gliders in a pack of 100+ rewards. Seriously, guys?*). Fortnite is a constant work in progress because the devs care. Stop asking them for things then bitching about what they provide you with. They don’t have to give you extra content in the first place.

Fair criticism over pump shotguns and bugs that heavily affect daily gameplay are to be expected and are the posts we should be seeing on this subreddit. However, posts that simply bitch about little things are going to end up driving away the Epic redditors that come here to assist. My point is, sit back and enjoy the experience. ",FortNiteBR

Let me explain why I think so. 

- first, console is console. Sure, you have scuff and other fancy controllers, but it's made to be played with a controller. 

- it gives an unfair advantage to a small part of the community.

- it's an incentive for PC player to switch to console, just to get an unfair advantage over the others.

- it screws any ""e-sport"" / tournament on console. We've seen that with the vbucks event, where pc players switched over to console to farm wins. It's also obvious in stuff like PS league tournaments.

- it completely goes against the console set of mind. Something you can enjoy after work or school to chill. Something more casual, yes. There's no shame in that.

- it completely ruins the game for weaker players. Most will never get a solo win because of that. I mean, decent players can handle some kb/m players, but someone who's less skilled doesn't stand a chance against them, while they could have done something, or at least learned something against a controller player.

TL;DR: i believe the kb/m and controller are different categories, just like light and heavyweight in boxing. Yes, kb/m requires more skill, and you have to train more to master it. And that's exactly why you shouldn't mix them with controller players. ",FortNiteBR

Generally, the advantage you gain from getting an explosive (RPG, Clingers, C4, GL) is not proportional to the skill they require to kill with at all.

This doesn’t have to be a long post, so I’ll just keep it short.

The current state of the explosives is hurting the duo and squad meta, making it heavily RNG based and gives players unfair advantages over others because of their loot.

Heavy rocket/c4 spam is currently impossible to counter, not by building, only by spamming rockets back or hoping that the player spamming you stops spamming.

The rocket ammo cap balances this out in solos, but in squads/duos you’ll still be able to carry 24 to 48 rockets. With the current effectiveness against builds that number is more than enough to kill almost any player.

So, I suggest a nerf to structural damage and to revert the damage radius to only include the animation.

TLDLR: The rockets in general are overpowered and could use a slight nerf, the game should be reliant on skill and not who can spam the most rockets. These are my 2 cents.",FortNiteBR

Little building = low rank

I really think this would make the game more fairer and fun for all players.

It would also work well in duos and squads, similar to how overwatch balances via SR.

I understand Fortnite is a casual game to a lot of players, but that doesn't mean Epic doesn't have to ignore the competitive players that play the game and not offer rewards for wins.  Maybe have a trail for 10 season wins, a back bling for 25, a glider for 50, a pickaxe for 75, and a skin for 100?  100 might be pushing it so maybe scale it down to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, but you guys get the idea.  I just find it unfair that all challenges are most based on just how much you play.  I work 9-5 every day and I have classes to study for during the semester, so I obviously can't sit down and play 6 hours a day like a 14 year old on Spring break, but I am good enough at the game to have around an 8% win rate.  That is why I'd like something to work towards other than level 80, which just seems like mindless grinding that I simply don't have the time to do considering I try to go out on the weekends and only play 2 hours a day tops.  I'd love to hear anyone's counter arguments to this.  I'm assuming they're going to be something like ""Well its not fair to the people who aren't good enough to win that much in a season"" ""I play 6 hours a day and only have 10 wins this season"" etc.. and my response to those are: **There are so many other skins for you.**  Just let us good players have something that people look at and think ""Oh, this player is definitely decent"" rather than what I thought when I saw a green omega: ""Oh this guy must play a lot""",FortNiteBR

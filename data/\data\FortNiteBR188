I feel like the game is almost solely won by being a good builder. Gun skills means almost nothing anymore unless your Shroud, where you can rely on your god tier aim to get you through the game. Ever since turbo building was input, it has taken the skill out of the game. Everybody can spam build and just dump hundreds of mats into a fight. I personally don‚Äôt find it very fun to play anymore because every single fight turns out almost solely based on building. I think they should remove turbo building so that building actually becomes skillful again. It will take actual precision and practice to be a good builder and win the fights. It will promote more gun play and less spam building. This could also help with late game lag issues, as players will not be building as much, or at least not as consistently. I can see how people like the turbo building option, but I feel like it has lost its value now. Does anybody else feel that way? Or maybe have a differing viewpoint? Let‚Äôs discuss!

Whats the point of better reaction timing if someone can just get lucky? The pro players in this game rely on their aim and their reaction timing. Looking at some of the forum posts from before this nerf I constantly saw STFU Double Pump takes no skill and you just abusing an exploit and your absolute Sh%t. Instead of insulting the people trying to suggest things for the future of the game lets use facts and evidence to present ideas instead of just attacking each other over whos right and whos wrong.

I really do believe that the SMG meta is ruining fortnite I‚Äôve always been competitive and decently good at video games and fortnite was really easy to learn and I loved it. Having said that I seriously miss battling against other high skill players and having build battles. It seems Non existent now that season 5 is all about spray and pray.

Epic please consider what you‚Äôre doing to your fanbase that actually cares about having skill within your game. I know casuals make up the majority of the game but in the end you‚Äôre going to kill Fortnite.

First 2-3 games were full of bots. I could tell I was matched with PC players because we usually do not have players this bad on console. Then I won a game with few kills. Biggest mistake ever! As soon as I won, lobbies were super sweaty, literally more than 50% of players had either TTV or YT extention to their names. I felt out played in building , getting edited on and shotgunned to face after getting grappled on multiple games. I was now competing against average PC players and it was not fun at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at their stats, none of them had my KD ratio or win %. They were less than half of what my stats were(pre ALPHA tournament).  But.. They were on PC and mechanically they always had advantage over me regardless of the situation. Soon enough I figured that the way I play against console players did not work against PC.

As for squads there are a few good teams every now and then but almost every team has got a few bots on them and in the end its more of a fun mode rather than tryhard. 

On a sidenote i excluded the ltm style soloshowdown and new tournament since those are clearly harder but not always available though i would rather have a competitive ladder at all times since its a lot more fun to actually have to tryhard for once. 

This is solely from my own experience so far and i would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

- Seats one.
- Rider has range of vision limited to 135¬∞ in front of them, but can fire weapons, heal, etc. However, the rider cannot control the chair and perform actions at the same time.
- A second player can push for increased speed. They will be unable to hold on long at high speeds, but also free up the seated player from having to control movement. As well, the secondary can turn quicker and brake harder.


New Skins: **Mercy Ops** and **Recovery Agent**  

- Male and Female Nurses in full scrubs.  
- Pickaxe is a big needle on a stick. The stick is salvaged from a hospital weigh scale.  
- Part of the **Support Squadron** set.

I hate Disco Domination. It's slow-paced and aggravating.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with all of the different mobility options, it takes way too long to get from one dance floor to the other, or just around the map in general. The respawn time is ridiculously slow and the lack of shields make it nearly impossible to survive longer than .5 seconds trying to contest an enemy dance floor, especially late-game. Sure there are supply drops, but they don't do nearly enough to balance anything.

I've tried multiple strategies, including using 3 slots for shields and the other two for weapons(meaning I'm pretty much toasted in every fight I come across), building around the dance floors after they've been claimed(enemy comes along with 'nades and poof, all those materials and time were wasted), and waiting in the air to see where dance floors spawn to claim them first(again, slow-paced). I understand it's still new and improvements can be made, but at least in the mean time provide another game mode for players(like myself) who just want to have fun/chill but still competitive matches.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I want fights every second where I want a guaranteed win, or that I want the game to be ""easier"", but I just think it's a scuffed game mode that needs to be in the game for a week then get it out of there and bring back Blitz or Fly Explosives or any number of other fun game-modes. 

&amp;#x200B;

And don't even get me started on the lag/graphics issues. Any time I get to an area where there's more than like 5 players, I might as well just start standing still seeing as none of my shots hit their target and switching weapons never registers what you're doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, just wanted to vent a bit and get everyone's opinion on the game mode. I'm not having fun with it at all and it needs to go. Am I missing something?",FortNiteBR

50v50 is more relaxed and just let‚Äôs you enjoy the gameplay of the game. You either win or you lose. Either way (and I know this sounds corny as hell) you have fun.

My theory is if you take someone who has not used a controller without aim assist and put someone on pc which clearly doesn‚Äôt have aim assist either, is that they will both be equally as bad at aiming. I think that allowing controller players to use aim assist takes away one step in being a good FPS player, which is training aim. The reason pc players are good at aiming is because they have practiced their aim. I don‚Äôt play on controller, but I think that controller players could train their aim to be precise and they could compete along with pc players. The aim assist system is not perfect nor will it ever be. This is just an idea, and console fortnite is directed more towards a casual gamer, and casual gamers don‚Äôt want to spend hours a day practicing their aim.",FortNiteBR

The game has never felt better and more competitive. Thank you Epic.

That said I have a few more requests I think console would greatly benefit from. As we all know now, Epic is sticking to there guns with keeping console and PC in 1 environment for tournaments. If that‚Äôs the case we need a few more things to compete 

1. Custom deadzones. We need custom deadzones because the ones on console as of now aren‚Äôt perfect (especially us xbox players). It‚Äôs really hard to pinpoint an exact spot on the map simply because the deadzones are too high. Please allow us to fully customize our preferred deadzone settings

2. Allow us to disable motion blur. Motion blur is honestly a really bad thing and is completely the opposite of anything competitive whatsoever. Allow us to please disable it. It would greatly make things smoother.

3. This one I doubt you‚Äôll do, but if you want to put us up against PC players, please consider it. Allow us to disable shadows for smoother and more competitive gameplay. I‚Äôm fully aware PC has this option because some PCs can‚Äôt handle high graphic settings, but not a single top tier serious PC player would ever think of playing any game with shadows. It‚Äôs easier on the system to run so it would be smoother, but it also gives a competitive advantage. For one, the sun wouldn‚Äôt blind your entire screen during sunset and morning. Two, it‚Äôs easier to keep track of pretty much everything because there‚Äôs no shadows making certain areas darker than others. This is one of PCs biggest advantages 


Thanks for reading. I‚Äôm not trying to sound ungrateful and I hope most of you understand that. Once more, thank you Epic for truly making console Fortnite better. These are just the last 3 things I personally believe need implemented if you want to keep console players on crossplay with PC during tournaments and during skirmish events ",FortNiteBR

However I'm the kind of player that will knock your fortress down instead of building against you. 

I do enjoy watching a few streamers mostly just NickEh30, CDNThe3rd and ObeyUpshall, however I find most satisfaction when they eat shit when building and showboating goes wrong. 

***So I'm just putting my question to the Reddit community, do you think we would have naturally seen build battling become such a rampant and widespread technique used by the vast majority of players ANYWAY/DESPITE streamers? Or do we have streamers to thank/blame for its proliferation?***

I'd actually really like to hear from Epic what their opinion is on build battles; probably an instance of a developer creating a gameplay mechanic that went above and beyond their expectations and wildest guesses on what would/could be done by the players.

This needs to be talked about...

This is a problem for for a couple reasons:
 1. THE BIGGEST ISSUE, these players get the advantage of using keyboard and mouse. But, unlike if they were to play on PC, they will have aim assist as well. This makes the advantage more unfair than if console is paired with pc.

2. The new rule set by EPIC is that KB&amp;M players will be paired with other KB&amp;M players. These players are directly undermining that rule by using a device that essentially enables the advantages of both pc and console.


There's nothing worse than going through a great game and getting eliminated just to see the person who eliminated you, having 16 kills, is using KB&amp;M and then they go on to win the victory royale. If I play squad/duo crossplay and get annihilated by a pc player then good. That's what I signed up for and I knew that was a possibility in that game mode. But not solos. Having the top 3 players remaining using KB&amp;M on console just goes to show that EPIC used a bandage to fix this problem when they need to go for the full chugjug. 

I understand that this is a technically difficult problem to fix due to not being able to prove that someone is using this type of device. The input is disguised so they avoid the input identification that had been set up recently by EPIC. The only tell tale sign is gameplay behavior. This is not seen in the skill of the player but can be seen  mostly by the way the player rotates their view. The other area it can be seen is walking direction, which is harder to notice. the effect happens because there are 4 directional buttons on the keayboard vs 360 degrees of direction on a controller. See for yourself in the games when you get eliminated. About 20% of the time you will spectate a KB&amp;M user by the end of the game. The difference is very noticeable.

Unfortunately you have based on the pro players who do it for work, not on the community in general, you are based on the players with the CONTROLLER from PC, they can compete against those who use the PC KEYBOARD, but you forgot who wants to play with the CONTROLLER from CONSOLE, the console does not have the same performance as PC, we can't have the stretched resolution, we can't exceed 60 fps, a monitor at 144hz for us console is useless, many times we have frame drops from the many constructions we console are limited.

However, I found that many people, despite many posts having been published about it, don't know what XIM is and its significance on console. I'm going to try to explain it, talk about attempts to fix it, and weigh in both sides of the 'XIM ban' argument.

\*\*What is XIM?\*\*

XIM4 and XIM Apex are two devices that serve as adapters for keyboard and mouse support on console. Essentially, they take input from your keyboard and mouse, and using a series of algorithms, transform it into input that the console recognizes as that of a controller. For example, pressing the space bar on a keyboard connected to a XIM adapter would cause the same signal that a controller would send when 'A' is pressed. This allows console players to achieve an controls experience that closely mocks that of PC.

\*\*The problem:\*\*

It only takes a quick glance at Fortnite's competitive scene to see that PC (KBM) players generally have a large advantage over controller players. Very few controller players get the chance to compete in Fortnite's biggest tournaments. While Epic is working on ways to fix this, through their addition of extensive controller customization, aiming and building with a mouse will always be easier on KBM than it is on controller. Most of you already know this, but for those who don't, I'll elaborate. KBM players are able to build much quicker due to easier build accessibility, faster turning, faster editing, and finer adjustments. KBM players also have the ability to have a button mapped to each weapon in their hotbar, allowing for faster and more effective weapon switching. They also enjoy advantages in aiming due to the fine tuning that a mouse allows.

\*Thus, keyboard and mouse players in lobbies full of controller players start the game with a large inherent advantage.\*

On PS4, players are able to connect keyboards and mice directly into the console and benefit from these same advantages, as Sony introduced integrated KBM support. This integrated support gives KBM players an experience that is much closer to PC, as they lose the ability to use the controller aim assist, are able to change mouse sensitivity, assign keybinds directly from the in game settings. This support also allows developers of PS4 games to use built in APIs to detect the use of KBM and take appropriate action. The v6.0.0 update to Fortnite introduced input-based matchmaking to PS4, meaning that those who choose to play with mouse and keyboard are matched with PC.

\*This does not eliminate unfair KBM usage on PS4. Why?\*

As I explained earlier, XIM works by emulating a controller, and thus making the console think that the KBM input is from a controller. So, even with the integrated KBM support, PS4 players can use XIM devices to bypass the input-based matchmaking by ""passing"" the KBM input as that of a controller. Sony's KBM integration, therefore, helped the problem, but didn't eradicate it.

\*So what about Xbox?\*

Unlike PS4, Xbox does not currently support integrated KBM use. This means that, for an Xbox player, the only way to play with KBM would be to use a XIM device. Since this is undetectable, there is currently no input-based matchmaking on Xbox, leading all Xbox KBM players to having an edge over their opponents regardless of their intentions.

\*Intentions? These people are clearly just cheaters.\*

Being that PS4 has integrated KBM support for keyboards and mice, nearly all XIM users on the platform are solely using it to gain an unfair advantage over their controller-wielding opponents. While this may also be true for some Xbox XIM users, there are ways in which XIM devices can be used with good intentions. Many people simply prefer the control scheme of keyboard and mouse but cannot afford a gaming PC capable of playing Fortnite at reasonable settings. A gaming computer with a mid-range graphics card can run about $600, while a used Xbox One and XIM device can be purchased for less than $300. This also does not take into account that many of these people likely owned Xbox systems before deciding to use KBM, in which case the purchase of a XIM would run them only $100. In addition to budgeting, there are legitimate disabilities and injuries that disallow people from properly using an Xbox controller, leaving them with the sole option of using KBM. They might have friends who play on Xbox and want to be able to play other games that lack cross-comparability with them.

These are theoretical situations, however, and do not change the fact that, regardless of circumstance, console KBM players should be matched with PC players or other console KBM players.

\*So why don't we just take all of the XIM users and put them in PC servers?\*

This is evidently harder than it sounds. 5 days ago, Epic rolled out their first version of XIM detection on Xbox. The detection worked by analyzing the movement patterns of all Xbox players in a lobby towards the beginning of the game. Since there are only 4 movement keys on a keyboard, and they are being emulated across a joystick, it is easy to tell when a person is using a keyboard. This part gets a bit tricky to explain. Pressing the W key would cause the XIM to transmit a signal to the Xbox that the person was holding their joystick directly forward. It may seem like that is what an Xbox controller player would do if they wanted to move in a straight line, but the difference is that there would be a slight amount of variability in the controller players movement, since the joystick can be moved in thousands of different directions, some of which are very similar to one another

If a player exhibited movement behavior that resembles keyboard-based movement, they would be kicked from the match. This first detection system, however, had a slew of problems.

\- The time at which players were kicked for XIM usage was relatively uniform. It typically happened between 3 to 4 minutes into the match. This is when the server would check the players' inputs for legitimacy. This 'check' only happened once a match, so XIM players could play with controller for the first 4 minutes of the match, and carry out the rest using KBM.

\- Some reported that, if a player simply stayed in place between the 3 and 4 minute mark, they could use KBM up to 3 minutes into the match and continue using it after a minute had passed.

\- This was a very basic solution, and a basic change to the XIM code could completely bypass it.

Sure enough, the XIM developers had a fully working bypass to the detection merely hours after it was implemented.

\*Aren't there better ways to do it then?\*

Yes, but not without problems. Most other solutions run the risk of false positives, meaning that controller players could get banned for KBM use solely based on their in-game habits. A developer at Xbox tweeted that these devices were detectable through APIs similar to those on PS4, but we have yet to see Epic give these a shot. For now, it seems that Epic is currently working on a solution behind the scenes that we are likely to see roll out within the month. It also should be mentioned that the XIM team is notorious for keeping cards up their sleeves and are actively working on ways to ensure that there platform remains undetected in the coming months.

I hope this post could help at least one person understand this whole situation. For those who haven't read much into it, many of the rant posts from console players on the subreddit likely don't make much sense, so maybe this can clear some of it up.

These skins will return December 12th (12/12) because of recent releases of highly requested skins. It all started with Red Knight, which released on 8/8. Then Power Chord on 9/9. Our most recent was Skull Trooper, on 10/10. I have a feeling Star Spangled Ranger and Trooper will return on 11/11, which is Veteran's Day in the US. That leads to the release of Christmas skins on 12/12. The patch (7.01?) will most likely be on Wednesday, December 12th. The same thing will happen, a skin or two will release with the patch in the featured item section. My guess is Merry Marauder and Ginger Gunner along with Candy Axe. I'm not sure after that, but I have a feeling they aren't going to re-release Crackshot, Codename E.L.F. and Red-Nosed Raider. Nog Ops and Yuletide Ranger will probably make a return, however.

I'm not talking about dances from Battle Passes but about the ones that you can buy in the shop.

Electro Shuffle, Smooth Moves, Kicks-up were dances that I wanted to buy but I couldn't get V-bucks by that time or I couldn't play. So I'm asking If we can ""expect"" dances that will come out and when they will come out.  
If there's an actual way, I'd like to know it and how it works because missing theses dances was really hard and I really want them.  


Can we get back emotes that we missed and is there a way to know when they will come out ?

A user has a modified controller because they have a disability, and unfortunately that is causing the game to kick them. Per the forum poster:"," Hi,

I have a very big problem and the support does not answer me. Since a few days I am disconnected from each game of fortnite. Disconnection and this message ""the selected device does not match, please disconnect the mouse or keyboard and restart fortnite"" I did everything, restart the console, clear the cache, reinstall the game but nothing helps, I still have the same problem. I am on xboxone. How to do ? I understand that epic games wanted to chase gamers out of order, but my controller was simply changed by the amputation of my right arm last June to following a cancer. I play with a controller adapted to my handicap, the keys are all deported to the left. I can't play a full game. HELP ME PLEASE

Epic pls increase your support staff!,"So I started playing Fortnite at the end of last year, early this year. I really enjoyed it and played a couple thousand games since then. I was quite good, joined a team was about to try hard to be a pro player. Then i experienced an injury in one of my hands and had to take a break for 2-3 weeks. Not a problem for me, i was going to get back.

When i tried to get back i saw that all my friends were deleted, i quickly checked my separate email (for security reasons its separated) and saw some cyrillic emails from Epic-Games. Quickly i wanted to reset my password (2 step authentication was not/barely a thing back then, this was around mid June) and messaged Epic Games Support to let them know i got hacked. Long story short, i got no answer ever since and  yesterday i could finally get the password reset email. 

Because i was still logged in back then i could play 1-2 matches but was still frustrated about not being able to get my couple hundred dollars worth of skins account safe. 

Now i can not login anymore because i do not have the password, i can not change my password because now there is 2step authentication available and i can not reach out to Epic games, because the do not respond. I also refuse to make another account to start over again since i want to play with my skins.

I tried to google for others in a similar situation and it seems like there was a leak in Google accounts with password dumps. The interesting part about this is, my password was unique for my Epic Games account. Does this mean Epic Games saves passwords on Google Servers *encrypted*? 

Also there seems to be a lot of people out there with a similar issue. Epic Games, please make sure hacked accounts have a priority, i would really like to play with the new and awesome stuff you realease.",FortNiteBR

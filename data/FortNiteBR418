Seems like winning becomes pointless because you have nothing to show off from it.

2) is there any way to link multiple epic accounts to the ps4? My brother started playing before me and he linked his epic account to my psn. I just want to be able to show my stats, because right now it’s all zeros. Also how do I log out on the PS4?

3) where are the best places to drop? Currently go to greasy, dusty, retail or the jails.

The amount of team killing going on is horrendous. I can no longer play team games. I've gone on 7 or 8 game streaks of being killed by my team, then have 1 normal game and back to team killing for a few more before quitting in frustration. People will say just play solo but after a while you want a change. A good team game is more fun that a solo game and plays differently. I've reported every one of my killers but who the fuck knows if that does anything. I know Epic is saying their handling it but how? What exactly are they doing? Is there any real progress or could we have feedback on reports?

All the others POI's in the game are mostly singular buildings spread quite far out while the prison is 2 huge multi level buildings right next to each other (I believe).

The new location looks awesome! If you can can go inside every level on those two tall buildings it will be crazy, my kind of place.

I would really like more locations like the prison and new city, if it is what I think it is. Maybe this map it too cramped for locations like these but hopefully there's more on the second map :)

If you have any ideas for locations feel free to comment below. Here are some of mine:

-School/University

-Library

-Hospital 

-Museum

-Cinema or Theatre

-Shopping mall

-Fire/Police station

-Military Base

-Airport

-Theme park/Carnival

Personally I think the hospital would be the coolest to see because it could have many floors, and many rooms and stuff like a glass tunnel bridge linking from one huge building to another. ",FortNiteBR

What if after a certain period of time the materials start to show some aging to distinguish new forts from old ones? For example: Wood starts to grow moss after time. Stone starts to grow vines. Steel starts to rust. This would not change anything regarding hp of materials but it would be an additional visual cue/piece of info. Lemme know what you guys think. ,FortNiteBR

I don’t see how it could cause anything but fairness in the future for FortNite.

1) Better way to know if someone is cheating. I’ve seen a bunch of clips showing what people think are cheaters using aimbot. Currently there isn’t a for sure way to find out, so with the addition of kill cams I feel it would be easier to tell if someone just got lucky or is, indeed, aimbotting.

2) More satisfying knowing how you died, and how you can use that info for the future. Games are all about adapting and learning the mistakes you’ve made, then improving upon them. Knowing the exact way you die can help players learn from their deaths and use that for their advantage by, well...*not* doing that in the future.

• Most games that don’t have kill cams don’t have them because it gives away people’s position, but with the current system of spectating the enemy, it makes practically no difference in this regard.

Edit: This would only work for solos though, as dead players could call out where the enemies are. Unless you guys have some ideas for squads..?",FortNiteBR

You can't create a balanced situation off of ""alright well if my team kills me my loot won't drop..."" Because that can be abused.

Bans are not effective because alt accounts and nobody actually knows if someone who team killed them gets banned... So there's no retribution for the victim.

Edit: ricochet bullets is almost as bad as no team damage... You can spam explosives and just die away from the fight, your mate cleans up and simply goes to Rez you

Kick/forgive grants the victim power where he had none before, where if someone shoots him he can give the middle finger, and boot the player.  Maybe a 5-10 minute ""you got kicked for team killing too many times"" penalty.  If you ever wanna see the complaints stop, allow players who got team killed to enact immediate revenge.  

I guarantee you'll see less team killing in the first place because no one wants to sacrifice themselves so their friends can take the random players loot, and those that do will end up with penalties that keep them from playing the next game for a while... AND people may be satisfied with ""well, he killed me but I got to ruin his fun too.""

TL;DR: kick/forgive is the only option I see to fix team killing that will please the majority of players.

Swapping weapons or material build quickly then pressing R2 is the worst. It should take me 0.3 seconds to swap to a shield and use it (or the same time it takes me to press R1 to switch to shield, and R2 to apply), but it takes a full 2 seconds right now. Switch to shield, them spam ''R2'' 3-4 times until it starts using the shield. The response is just bad. Same for trying to do stairs real quick mid fight: I tap CIRCLE (build) + R1 (swap to floor) + R1 (swap to stairs) + R2 (apply) and here I am building a floor and getting shot at by some dude with a purple scar

22,StParadox,1512578925,7hz9up,62,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7hz9up/fortnite_practice_mode/,68,Fortnite Practice mode?,"Greetings all,

I've recently started playing Fortnite BR, and I was surprised from how good it was, both in quality and gameplay.

However, there are several issues I've faced while playing it:

I: Gun aim and recoil: I felt the recoil and the aim were quite weird and not fast to get used to, specifically with the variety of weapons in game.

II: Building: This is a great utility and it's always handy late game/end game, sadly, scrubs like I, take 920 years to build a small house around myself or even counter build the enemy team.

I propose a solution, which is create a permanent mode in BR which is called Practice. Within practice mode you get infinite resources to learn how to build efficiently, as well as infinite ammo and different variety of guns to have a feel on how they operate in the game. It could be a very small map, simply to prepare you more for BR.

The semi-auto requires multiple hits to kill someone, making it much harder to use and it gives away your position easier as well. 

If the semi-auto sniper were to become silenced, think about how practical it is. 

-Multiple shots originally gives away position. Now that is no longer as big of a problem. 

-Gives a reason to pick up semi-auto over bolt action. 

-Silenced smg's are good but they require you to be up close, where enemies already see you usually. If an enemy shoots back then your silencer was pointless because they made a ton of noise anyways.

32,Accentrick,1512568208,7hy4r5,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7hy4r5/most_annoying_bugs_ps4/,105,Most annoying bugs (PS4),"Some of the bugs I'm listing might apply to all platforms, but I can't say for sure so I titled the post specifically for the PS4 Version. 

1. Chests opening but staying active: After holding to open the chest for the full time the contents will eject but the chest will stay locked and glowing. What also occurs is the next successive button presses will auto lock to the chest icon. Even though the contents are out, and you are spamming to loot the items, you will instead keep tapping to open the chest for 2-5 seconds. 

2. Ammo Crates on shelves: When the bullets are ejected from the ammo crates it appears as though the bullets travel up and backwards and get lodged between the wall and shelf. You cannot pick them up manually or with auto pick up in most cases unless you completely break the shelf.

3. Auto-aim to downed targets: This applies to console only. Let's say there are 2 enemies in front of you. You knock one down so he is in the DBNO animation and his friend is trying to kill you. When you aim, your reticle will essentially lock onto the downed target. Its almost like the guy who's knocked has a magnet for you sight. The aim assist is ridiculously strong and makes winning that gunfight almost impossible, because whenever you ads your reticle snaps to the downed target.

4. Aim lock to objects: This was a larger issue a few patches ago but recently I've noticed it again. Basically your reticle with aim lock to objects instead of players, even in gunfights. Yesterday in a gunfight my reticle suddenly shifted to lock onto a street sign in the middle of me shooting. 

QoL change. This happened to me once awhile ago but it happens to my friends and I hear it every so often when I jump. This is players accidentally deploying gliders immediately after jumping because they accidentally double tap to jump. This happens more frequently when you try to jump out the second you're allowed to. So in the process of spamming the button they open the glider. The glider deploy button should be remapped to the shooting button so it takes 2 separate actions to avoid the accidental glider opening.

This is all I have for now. I'll be sure to update if I see any comments pointing out things I forgot.",FortNiteBR

It seems clear that most people just presume MP shooters are run and gun full on non-stop fights. 

Just so people are aware; Stealth gameplay is a genre of video games in it's own right (e.g. Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell... in real life armies camped in trenches over hills, dug holes to snipe from, hid in buildings etc). 

In fact every game I see now it's often such a predicable fire-fight; people build their towers as high as they can; then shoot rockets at each others towers, someone gets sniped; it's just so predicable to watch most end games. There's no tension, no sneaky clever tactics. 

Whatever you think about stealth/camping just accept then when someone sneaks and plays silently and beats you; respect that type of gameplay, it's valid and it's fun and that's why Fortnight BR is a fun type of game for all different types of players (it shouldn't become COD). ",FortNiteBR

* RNG gun accuracy - One game you might get a white rifle that's perfectly accurate 5 shots in a row from 100 meters away, and the next you can get a gold scar where every bullet misses at the same range  
* Intense aim assist - Even without your thumb on the stick, if an enemy moves past your aim it will pull your crosshairs. Down one player, try aiming at his teammate next to him and your aim drags on the downed guy, etc.  
* Inventory management/control schemes - No shortcut/hotkey to specific items. Switching to combat pro scheme improves cycling through items with bumpers either direction rather than just using Y button, but even on default scheme the left and right dpad buttons are unused, while down on dpad is wasted on dance emote  
* DBNO shield - Have to wait like 2-3 seconds to finish off a downed player  
* Sniper bullet delay/velocity - you need to lead your shot even on a downed player crawling 50 feet away  
* Building obstacles - The logic for where you can build seems off, mainly trees blocking you, from even a couple squares away  
* Obscene in-game paid content prices - Releasing a free game doesn't mean you should charge $15 for a pair of digital pants. Pretty sure I could buy a real pick axe for cheaper than the stupid ones they sell in game

As I said, don't bother calling me bad (because not to sound egotistical, I know i'm not), the AR simply doesn't really have any pay off for single tapping versus spraying like a maniac.

let me start by outlining one of the basic rules of video game controls design

""there exists a way for the player to achieve what they want"" is a stupid mindset that is largely dead in the industry. ""the game should do whatever the player obviously wants it to do at all times"" got figured out by the giants 15 or more years ago (there's a reason they are giants now) and is universally accepted as the right way of thinking in game design. people who are arrogant enough to think their control schemes are superior and people just need to get used to them get fired extremely quickly

so people who respond like ""omg u just nede to learn the controls"" are retarded and can safely be excluded from the discussion entirely

now for the problems:

## building is bad

since building is such a core part of the game you would expect it to be done well but it is not. i have identified a few specific problems here:

1. the game should switch materials when you run out. this should be obvious

2. the voxel grid you have to build in causes a lot of problems when surfaces are very close to a voxel boundary. specific examples of this are building stairs that stick 3cm out of the side of a mountain, or building walls that have the bottom 5cm above the ground. it's really difficult to fill in the small holes, i believe you have to aim in the small gap to make it work? this should be made a lot easier

3. random garbage like trees get in the way constantly. please just make it kill the trees it's stupid. or just make stuff overlap with the trees.

4. if you're building stairs and running up them and switch to a ceiling/pointy piece it should not try to build it directly above you unless you are looking almost straight up. it's way too easy to trap yourself on stairs with a ceiling piece

this is by no means an exhaustive list of problems but these are easy fixes and big wins.

## inventory management is bad

i can't even figure out what is going on with this one. if i kill someone and try to take a couple of their guns and a medikit or something then i end up dropping one of the guns i wanted to keep back on the floor. literally 100% of the time. i have no idea what causes this, but the game very consistently does the wrong thing and i don't know what to do about it

if anyone can figure this out i'd like to know what is going on

## inputs are buffered for way way too long

input buffering is another one of those things that is universally regarded as good and the right thing to do. buffering inputs for a couple of frames ironically makes people feel like the game is more responsive and accurate

but buffering inputs for 500ms+ is insane. if you forget you have a pump instead of tac you click like you were going to fire the tac, nothing happens, then 500ms later you shoot your pump at air

it's extremely annoying but luckily it's an extremely easy fix too

I feel like it´s not worth it to engage into fights since you will probably lose your shield early on and lets be honest, you rarely get shields from the enemies u kill.  
  
I **personally** think they should limit shields to +50 not +100 and let us heal to 100 health with normal bandages.

It does make me kind of sad because I've only won 7 times, adding that 4 it should be 11. As tough as it is to win these stats are what motivate me to play, if my win might not be recorded it's tough justifying playing. Its still fun but this really is a shame.

And I know not everything can be a rifle and do 30+ damage every shot, but every other gun has something useful. Even revolvers at their 1 shot per 5 seconds do enough damage that if you execute well you can win. You can't do that with an SMG. If it did 20 damage and took 5 shots to kill someone, maybe you could do it.

Using the combat pro configuration compared to the default configuration feels like a night and day difference, but it still leaves something to be desired when it comes to building. Needing to open build mode then scroll through to each desired piece is extremely time consuming when under fire and can often get you killed. For players with higher pings the server also often doesn't register that you have even pressed the scroll button leading to issues like spamming floors when you want stairs or over scrolling past stairs to roofs because the server registration of your scrolling was too slow and you think it won't register at all. This leads to an extremely frustrating experience as well as lowers the skill ceiling potential on console. 

With the combat pro configuration only two of the directional pad buttons are being used: Up for inventory and down for emote. I think most players would agree that the emote does not need to be instantly accessible, and could be remapped to D-pad down press and hold. This would allow the four D-pad directions to instead be used for the four building items. Rather than activating build mode with B a player would simply press D-pad left for walls and instantly have the build option of walls. Players should be allowed to remap these as they see fit by my recommendations based on accessibility and frequency of use would be: left walls, up stairs, right roofs, down floors.

Because B/Circle is not being used anymore this button could become the new inventory button instead of D-pad up. Finally, to exit build mode pressing Y/Triangle would pull out the pickaxe like normal, or RB/LB/L1/L2 would swap back to the previously selected weapon. 

Overall I think this controller scheme would be greatly appreciated  by the console community and would make for a much more enjoyable experience. Simply being able to pull out stairs in one button press rather than three would allow for some of the more timely and interesting plays we see performed on PC.",FortNiteBR

They're too easy to get early game and provide an insane advantage. It encourages players to keep their shields by avoiding fights. The ""campy"" play-style is perfectly fine but I think those the people racking up kills are put at a major disadvantage fighting 75 vs 200 health for others that have had no fights. Fighting in Fortnite is SO incredibly fun that it really sucks to be punished for doing it. It's not fair (nor fun) to land 5 shots on someone and die to their 3rd shot. You effectively have to land 6-7 body shots on a player with 200 health vs them landing 3 with an AR.

I think a 50 health boost from shields is plenty. That still gives you a large advantage and still keeps fighting over loot-crates viable. Each potion could be reduced to 25 per potion and/or increase the rarity.

Just my thoughts, I'd like to see some discussion as I've been hearing a lot of thoughts and ideas from the high-caliber streamers with a ton of hours put into this game.",FortNiteBR

it just feels clunky that people can literally spam all day at you while youre building and you are not getting any cover or room to breathe because the wall gets instantly destroyed, it really feels like a bad decision.

my suggestion would be to give structures once build a damage reduce of 90% for 2~ seconds so they dont crumble in an instant to give yourself some room to breath while under heavy fire or give the structures instantly half of their hp instead of whimsy 60 HP so they wont get shot down so quickly.

Sure there are pics of people with 200 shield and all 5 inventory slots with 2 shields each, but thats only 6 full shields for 100 players which is nothing.

TOO MUCH RNG: considering your weapons and ammo are also rng as to what find why would they make the health in game different. Sure somebody could find shield and be at 200hp but if their best weapon is a common smg and you have a scar you will win. 

THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL IF THEY HAVE SHIELD: and that is something i personally like, you have to think about who you engage with, if you run around just shooting everybody you see straight away you will die but if you time your attack you can get an easy head shot and if they shield they will be on an even fight with you/potentially dead before they can even turn around to kill you.

Making judgements on how many enemies are spotted become hard and in many situations impossible. The same issue exists for knowing how much health an enemy has left after taking damage.

So the claim of no competetive advantage is not quite as strong as it appears to be.

Like many have suggested, adding a mechanic of damage ricochet would allow to keep team damage in the game while removing all incentive for the TKers to do so. If they don't profit from it it's not problematic anymore.

To help solve this issue, I'd like to see players drop an ""Essence"" when they die.  When picked up, **it heals for 25 health over time with any excess healing is applied to shields.**  So if you're at 80 health, you'll get 20 health and 5 shields, while if you're at 100 health and 50 shields, you'll get 25 more shields.

There are two major restrictions.

First, unlike other items, Essence is not placed in your inventory.  When you pick it up, it is used automatically.  This keeps players from stockpiling Essences for later in the game.  If you're at 100 HP/100 Shields, it does nothing when you pick it up.  If you pick up a second one while a first one is still active, it could stack or not.  I lean towards allowing it to stack because if you go 1-on-3 and win, you should be rewarded with all three Essences.

Second, the Essence expires and disappears after 30 seconds if no one picks it up.  This makes it less likely for other players to find random Essences scattered around later and prevents ""saving"" it on the ground as well.  It's enough time to bandage up before you grab it, but you need to be quick about it.  It's a true ""use it or lose it"" item.

This item is designed to reward players who get kills in close/medium range combat and allow them to continue the game on more equal footing to those who avoid combat.  It also encourages players to loot their kill even if they don't need any of the items that were dropped.  The time limit makes it difficult to loot after a long range snipe, which is good since those long rage kills probably won't result in the attacker being damaged anyway.  Because it's used automatically, it doesn't put additional pressure on inventory management and can't be stockpiled.

I feel like this is a better solution to the ""75 HP vs 200 HP"" problem than changing rarities of Slurp, adding even more items to juggle in your inventory, or any of the other solutions that have been posted.  Let me know what you think.",FortNiteBR

Learning how to give the proper callout will turn even the noobiest of player into a valuable asset. In the Army they teach us how to give callouts and if you apply this technique your friends will love you for it and random players will want to be you.

In the Army they taught us the three D's. Distance. Direction. Description.

Everytime you spot an enemy you call out your three D's. Such as ""100 meters, North 15, 3 man team heading Southwest on the hill behind the tree on the right."" The distance doesn't have to be exact, in this game it's really just to help you figure out how far you need to look. The direction is found at the top of your screen. When you see an enemy callout the distance, while doing so look up at their direction then call that out. Finally, fill in the description with any other information that you believe is pertinent; are they in an engagement, farming resources, do they see you, are they building, behind a tree, which tree, color of the tree. You get the idea. When giving the callout don't panic, take a breath and find the words to say.

It's not particularly difficult but it does take effort to get it down and be able to do it efficiently, especially in an ever changing environment. Take time with it, learn the method, and execute.

**Don't be the guy that says, ""They're over there.""**

**TL;DR** Callout the three D's when you see an enemy if playing with others. Distance, direction, description.",FortNiteBR

I’m not trying to defend him as a fan or something I just watch his stream from time to time to learn new loot routes and tricks and strategies and ik I could watch any other Fortnite streamer for this, but still I’d say he deserves a second chance, he only did it once and think about all the players that actually learned a couple things from him and got better by just watching him or had a great time or whatever this is my first ever Reddit post.

TL;DR: AlexRami deserves a second chance, he admitted that he was wrong and feels guilt (doesn’t really show it)

Yesterday I saw a video posted here from a guy who was talking about how unfair it was that Fortnite supports the ingame mouse and keyboard gameplay on consoles. and yesterday I was watching the AlexRami playing (before he got banned for tk) in a moment he was kind a little tilting cause so many people was doing questions like, how is your sensitivity, if he is really playing in a controller, and he kind got a attitude like ""If you don't want to trust me, its your choice, I will not prove anything to you"". 

So the point is, I am a console player cause the only gaming pc that I ever had it was a super old and broke some months ago, but I do love to play shooting games, and I tried to play Fortnite on the Keyboard/Mouse on my Ps4 and it was a really bad experience, maybe because input lag, or maybe the 30fps, or even maybe the fucked up sensitivity configs. But I gave up really soon, and like everyone here I am addicted into the game, got almost 200 hours playing and I wish my accuracy with the controller could be better, but even that I am getting 12% winrate on matches, so I don't think I am super bad at the game.

So back to AlexRami, he is the top 1 in the ranks with almost 1000 wins, and I think he is consistently getting 30% or more for Winrate, the guy plays really well, he know what to do and what time to do it, but what I think it makes him better than the above average console player its that his aim, specially at close range with the shotguns are really really high and consistent. And at least for me, its the most hard thing to do and that I try to improve. But yesterday after seeing the video about the K/M support on the console, I tried one more time, I didn't had too much success, but one thing I noticed, my close range fights got a little more better. So AlexRami is saying that he plays in a controller, but could he be using the K/M and saying he is not? He could easily prove that he is using the controller by showing a handcam, but he have that attitude that its like ""I don't have to prove nothing, you are watching me because you want, you can leave anytime"". I sincerelly, I don't care if he is playing with K/M really(because even I want to use it if the game supports), I just wanted to know cause if he is really using and the game support it, I would like to practice more my K/M and see if I can get better results. 

And a question for anyone using the K/M on cosole, did you find it was more easy to play that way? Sorry for any grammar mistake, english its not my 1st language.",FortNiteBR

He was live streaming to over 3000 viewers on his Twitch channel when he blatantly broke the rules of the game.  It didn't take Epic long to respond.
  
Banning his main account was banning an account that Alex had invested some money into. He is upset at this loss of this investment. 
  Alex felt as though he was treated differently because he was a big streamer. His thoughts are that Epic should have simply banned his troll account and been on about their business.
  In my opinion though I think he is just upset that he got caught and banned, but I don't think he necessarily deserves a perma-ban, What do you think?

  I rather think that the banning of the problem player when 
possible does much more good to rid the community of rule breakers and cheaters. Alex is a big streamer and should know that Epic could easily identify both accounts belonging to him. Why would you only ban the side account as Epic?

**TL/DR**
  My question is if your looking at video proof, such as a stream, of a player breaking rules that have recently been confirmed to be ban worthy. As Epic would you ban the obvious player who was breaking the rules, or would you settle with banning what you know to be the side account used to break the rules, while holding onto the fact that he can simply log back into his main account? 

Edit to clarify:
  I just want to say I am affiliated with no one but myself, I am unbiased to the situation, and I had not known who AlexRamiGamimg was before I heard about this so I’m not some hater entertained by the misfortunes of others.

Edit again to state my own opinion:
  In my humble opinion however he got busted by streaming it, and is upset because he’s being punished. ",FortNiteBR

We are very good at communicating and splitting up loot but it seems like we never really have a game plan. Just kind of wandering to the circle.

I hate that close range battles devolve into jumping shotgun fests where bullet spread luck and pellets hitting your head can tilt the game in someones favor. Everyone just pulls out the red tac shotty when they get close and sprays which makes the smg obsolete. Removing headshot damage from the shotguns would be a buff to smgs and a much needed nerf to the overused red shotgun. Shotguns excel at popping out from a corner and dealing a burst of damage which requires no aim, and you can then go back behind cover. To have them able to headshot as well makes them completely outclass smgs and even the revolver. For how forgiving they are with aim requirements I think they should just do flat damage.",FortNiteBR

v-bucks, or by leveling up like every ten levels get a llama. Or just by milestones, win 5 times for a llama or 200 v-bucks

-add more levels or prestiges two months from now.

-Add custom matches that is probably the most fun thing

-New gamemodes like prop hunt, hide and seek, humans vs zombies. In case that they are making it harder to find matches make them available only on weekends

-Add more challenges that unlock you emblems and callsings so you can showcase your achievements on your profile, make that people can see your emblem and callsings when you kill them. Also your callsing shows your wins

-Add more maps (or add some things to the current map) here are some ideas. 

-Desert

-Snowy map (you can just make the current Battle Royale map snow and add features like for example freeze the lake and make it slippery)

- Make the weather change, cloudy, rainy, sunny

-A New York City themed map with central park and tall buildings (not excesively tall, make it so you can barely snipe people from the top, so people is not camping the whole match)

-Airport location in the map with a cool looking terminal

-Add a stadium location

-Add a zoo

New Weapons

- Red dot sight burst rifle

- Acog sniper

-Never add laser guns

- Buff the acog rifle's damage to 26, it's really bad right now

-New weapon skins that you can buy with v-bucks. Adding weapon skins, will keep the game fresh and you won't have to make new guns that will eventually become to much.

I'm trying to help improve the game by bringing up issues that plague it to the developers attention. I know it is a small issue yes, but it is an issue none-the-less that hinders the playing experience.

Some players play the game solely for the purpose of making the leaderboards. It's just a little bit unfair when you know you have ""x amount"" of wins and it's still showing 0. 

Unfortunately, I have not received a comment back yet after numerous attempts to figure out what is going on. 

As transparent and timely as Epic has been with issues the game faces since it's release, nobody can deny that it is a bit puzzling as to why the xbox&amp;ps4 ""friends leaderboards"" topic hasn't been addressed in over a month. 

**P.S. - This is not a post regarding stats going offline, this is strictly a leaderboard issue that a lot of players have been experiencing since the global leaderboards came out.**

I have made two posts regarding these topics in the past, I even included links to everyone else experiencing the same problem.

I have divided them into categories covering:

**Weapons, Consumables, Cosmetics, Traps, Map, Modes**

FYI (STW = Save the World)

So kicking off with weapons:

They've already added so many and so I've come up with some different ones -

**Riot Shield** (Can be used by holding LT/L2/PC control) blocks 300 (just a suggested amount of hp) damage before breaking.

**Tear Gas/Storm Grenade** - Either you have a tear gas grenade which damages enemies and messes with their vision while inside the AOE. Could be thrown into players forts to make them move.
Or have a storm grenade which produces a small storm AOE which damages players like when you're in the actual storm.

**Suppressed Sniper** - Shoot at your enemies quietly without giving away your position. Can be modified to have lower damage since it has the suppressor.

Now, ***Consumables*** are pretty cool in this game. The bush? Slurp juice? Nice!

How about....

***Green Tea*** - It slowly fills you back up with 40hp like the Slurp does ***BUT*** it also makes your footsteps ***quiet*** like a Ninja (Ninjas are in STW) for 2 minutes (suggestion)

***Magic Potion*** - This could do two things. It either takes some of your shield away to restore your health ***OR*** it takes away some of your health to give you a shield.

Now, ***Cosmetics*** this is where it can get really fun.

EPIC have already started the ball rolling with this one obviously and I myself have seen suggestions for Christmas themed ideas such as Santa's Sleigh replacing the Battle Bus. Presents to replace the golden chests and other things. This would be excellent for a timed themed event on BR.

The things I am suggesting is camos for the ***umbrellas***. If anyone doesn't know you get an umbrella after winning your first game.

It would be cool if you could get custom designs for your umbrella as well as your glider. What about a camo for Umbrella/Glider that shows how many wins you have in large red numbers on the top?

Also in STW, there are tons of character models that would be cool to play as in the BR mode. Characters like Constructor Penny and some of the Ninjas. Make it happen EPIC!

How about playing as one of the husks from STW? It's only a skin after all and would be fun to use in a tongue in cheek game.

Now.... ***Traps***

These are really cool to use but I have some ideas for new ones to be added:

***Sentry Turret***

Hear me out! A Sentry Turret trap could work in BR if it followed certain rules. Rules such as a pre-designated rotation limit such as 90* in an arc and a rule that said it will last as long as it has ammo or health and when either of those runs out the gun breaks.
It would be great to have in the game if you needed to cover your Fort entry and someone runs in with a shotgun only to find your sentry gun. It could even be the teddy bear from STW.

***Trap Chest***

This would be essentially a golden chest that would look slightly different but would otherwise act as a normal chest. When an unsuspecting player opens it, it spits out 3 grenades in close proximity to the chest. By having a tell on the chest players can always play smart and check before they open.

***Imagine*** you are being chased through Retail Row and you have one of these traps. You place it down in a place that looks legit and your aggressor runs into the building that you have now left, looking for you. Instead his greed takes over, he sees this golden chest, doesn't check it for it's tell and opens it only to get sploded.

***Proximity Mine***

Does what it says on the tin - Get two proximity mines to place down on the floor (or walls or ceilings!) that explode when someone steps onto or within one square of that trap. It could do 50 damage or 30 - devs can decide with color range. It could make a small noise to allow people to know that it's there but it could be hard to see so that it is still a good trap to find.

Now the ***Map***. EPIC have already gone ahead and done something awesome that is add a city part to the map. I would love to see a whole new map to play on but it could also split player base if you have the option to choose...

Maybe adding and changing pieces to the map every two months to keep it fresh and interesting could be good as there are a LOT of videos of golden chest locations on YouTube and I don't want the game to become stale because everyone goes to the same best location each time.

***Vehicles***

This is hard - vehicles are obviously in PUBG, Fortnite Battle Royale's direct rival which launches in 10 days. Vehicles that could work:

ATV - Dirtbike and Quadbike
Car -  2 seater? Maybe 4 seater but the speed and steering would have to be tested so I think the ATVs are easier to adapt to the game.

Finally, ***Modes*** - Just some quick fire ideas that could be good to add, even if only for a limited time.

50 vs 50.
10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10 v 10

eSports:

100 man eSports tournament.
100 players from 100 eSports team enter for a Fortnite eSports Tournament with a prize etc. Who would each team send, think of the clutch plays and the RNG, oh the RNG!

***Challenges***

Challenges that either reward xp or cosmetics.

Challenges like:

Kill 100/250/500/1000/2500 players
Set 10/25/50/100/250 traps
Win 1/5/25/50/100 games in Solo
"" "" in Duos
"" "" in Squads

You get the idea here and I don't want to teach EPIC how to suck eggs, they can make their own challenges up.

What about a way of displaying your rank? We earn xp for leveling up but no way to showcase your rank. How about some kind of display next to your name when you kill someone of your rank.

There could even be some kind of ""Mastery"" for every time you have hit level 100 and started over. It could be a picture of a players head, skull/cross bones/husk head etc just something that represents 100 levels.

I don't think there is anything else I can add at this minute but I would love to see other people's ideas :)",FortNiteBR

On multiple occasions my friends and I have been stuck in that terrible situation where the safe zone seems to continually be as far from us as possible. Throw in the gunfights that occur while trying to traverse the entire map and it’s nearly impossible, even if you win your gunfights, to have your entire squad reach the safe zone. But we being more about the team, had no problem deciding its best for one or a few of us to make it than for all of us to die. With this decision we VOLUNTARILY let our friends kill us and take our supplies in hopes that they can make it. Doing this has ended in a number of top places and wins we otherwise wouldn’t have achieved. Before anyone points this out, yes you could just drop your supplies and let them go on but in the DBNO state that is currently not possible.

While I understand the need to have some detergent on malicious team killing, I don’t want friendly fire completely taken out. Unfortunately I haven’t thought of anything aside from allowing us to drop items even in the DBNO state that they could do to achieve that magical balance. What do you think Epic could do to punish malicious killing without removing a useful mechanic?

It was incredibly op because of it's accuracy at the time that beat all the other assault rifles, and epic rightfully nerfed it to 23-24 dmg. This was fine when it was still the only 100% accurate hitscan weapon, it had a purpose in the game. 

But after the normal assault rifle has been buffed, it's purpose is gone. There is no reason to use the scoped rifle if you have a standard AR. I would even take a grey AR or grey burst AR over it, and it's mainly because of the terrible damage and now meaningless scope mechanic that it's become so underpowered.

So, what i suggest is that the scoped rifle can be reworked in two ways:

This will give it a strong purpose in the game:

* Heavy damage 35-40
* Slower firerate than normal AR
* Enough recoil to throw you off target at long range
* Variable zoom (Because that's fucking cool and will help with landing shots.)

This would give it a moderately powerful niche:

* 30 round magazine
* Higher firerate than normal AR 
* Slightly less recoil to allow for smooth tracking at medium range
* Variable zoom
* If any damage modification it should have less damage than now

This gives it a niche role as a long range tracking weapon which we currently don't really have.

EDIT:

Alternatively:

* Variable zoom

That is until I came up with my system,  lets call it 'the smart coward system"" now iv won 5 times in 2 days!!! 
This is on solo btw. 

Take a look and tell me what you think, or better yet try the system for yourself and see how you go 😁 

Folllow these 9 golden rules!!! And get more wins. It works for me! And I am not an amazing player. 

EDIT - This shouldn't be used if you are a new player to the game! 
Just play the game more aggressively at first to build up skill and learn all the lessons you need to be a better player. 

Second I have had plenty of experience running into battle and have learned to fight just fine. So no need to remind me that im not going to learn to fight this way. 

Also YES I am aware lots of people play this way, but iv seen heaps of people who still breaks plenty of these rules while playing this strategy. So I wanted to make my guide


1. Land on the side of the map farthest away from the bus. This means less people will be around and you can still find plenty of good loot

2. Do not enter named areas. All the named areas are full of players, avoid them and you will run into less people and have more of a chance of surviving 

3. Avoid combat unless cofronted.
Dont try and fight people if they are far away or you can escape unseen. They will die off anyway, its about survival until the end game. 

4. Stay away from the circle as long as possible. When the storm is coming. Get close to the circle find a hiding spot and wait until you need to leave. This avoids more players. 

5. Dont give your hiding spot away by shooting or running. If you see someone in the distance you think you can snipe . DONT. This just tells all other near by players where you are. 

6. Stay out of open areas. Stay close to cliffs, bushes, trees whatever you can use as cover. Dont go running threw an open field unless you have no choice. You will most lickly be seen. 

7. Dont go for supply drops unless safe.
Iv died so many times going for a supply drop that I think is safe, just to have someone waiting to snipe or shoot me. They are not worth it. You can get loot other ways. 

8. Always look behind you and around. Dont just run somewhere for 3 minutes without looking around you every now and again, someone might be following you waiting to attack. Also if you see someone first you will probably win the fight. 

9. Use health packs if you are not on 100% always. If you have 85% health and a health pack, then use it! Dont save it for when you have less health because that 15% might save your life. Better to enter a battle with full health.

It would also be cool to see snow covering the map we already have. Loot lake could be frozen over so that people could walk across it and would slide everywhere, and you could shoot holes in the icy surface to destroy some of the nearby tiles.

Has anybody experience with linking to an epic account subsequently and can give me clearification?

By using the method /u/quetschenpier described in his post i've went on the fortnite website, logged in with my psn, created a new epic account and by this linked those two accounts. After verifying my email i've logged into the game on ps4 and waited 15 minutes just for saftey.

Projectiles and arrow drop.

Different type of arrows 

Normal: 50 damage to the body, 100 for a headshot. Doesn't have arrow drop.

Explosive: Impact 50, explosion 50, headshot 25. Explosive arrow can be detonated mir air by clicking the shooting button without aiming. You can hold the shooting button, then click KT again to explode it when you please. Can stick to targets. Bandages remove the sticky arrow. Can destroy structures 

Poison: 25 impact, 50 headshot. On impact, it creates a poison that does damage over time. Weapons can't be used in the cloud, but you can sprint faster. 3 HP lost per second.

Fire: 60 impact, 20, headshot. On impact, it creates fire (no shit). 10 HP lost per second, 2hp lost per second for 3 seconds when you escape the fire. Can affect wood. Doesn't work on water.

Heavy arrow: 60 impact, 200 headshot. Heavy arrow so more arrow drop and slower projectile speed. On impact, it pins a player on the spot and causes a bleeding over time effect, losing 2 HP per second. Can pierce through structures.

Uncommon only has access to Normal and Heavy, rare has access to Explosive. Legendary has Posion and Fire.

Ammo drops: every drop has 15 arrow, 3 of each. You can remove the special perks of the special arrows if you want them to be normal and vice versa. 3 normal arrows can be used to create a heavy arrow.

What do you guys think? I would like if at least the normal, explosive and fire arrow are introduced

This would be sweet. As title says, when you run out of one type of material building, the game would auto switch you to the next available material you have to let you keep building. This would be super useful when trying to get cover and the enemy just shoots it down (team shoots it down). Just an idea, not sure how Epic feels about this being in game. Ultimately, in doing this you may have less mat items to loot when killing a player, and possibly less building in the end of a match. Not sure, what do you all think?

EDIT: I'm going to add this just so I don't have to say it a thousand times. I'm a console only player. This issue seems to be geared more toward consoles and not PC players. On console we are having to cycle to the correct material, where I don't believe it's the case for PC. It's not super different, but those few second(s) do matter, not to mention if you cycle one too many times it can just be a pain.

Test methodology:  
I use a 7700k clocked at 4.2ghz (I use 5ghz when I want high fps but isn't needed in this case),  
NVidia gtx 1080 with driver 388.31  
Game is installed on a 850 pro ssd   
windows 10 1709 version 16299.98  
Game settings are all maxed out and fps is capped at 60fps for consistency and vsync is off to get the right length of the hitch.

Afterburner graph: https://imgur.com/a/CKk8F  
The inconsistency in frametime is because of vsync not enabled and I have a refresh rate of 144hz. if enable vsync and set refresh rate is 60hz it is a flat line with hitching.

There seems to be a hitch every minute and one second. It doesn't matter if I run along a field, fight in the towns or I am afk. I hope this might help epic find the problem and fix it as soon as possible. It's not that the hitches are game breaking, but they are a bit annoying.

It automatically creates an Epic Games account with your PSN ID and **no email associated** with the account (frustrating part of the process).

Once the PS4 user launches the game for the first time, and is in the lobby, that user needs to go to epicgames.com and create an account. Unfortunately, the display name (the PSN ID) will be unavailable when creating the account on epicgames.com (because Epic Games created one automatically when the user launched the game). Choose a new one and type your email.

Once the account created, go to the account settings and to the [connected accouts page](https://www.epicgames.com/account/connected). There, link your PSN account.

Now that the account has been linked, the next step is to add and accept the friend request of the PC user. There's two ways of doing this. First, the PS4 user needs to install the Epic Games launcher on a PC, log into his new account and add his PC friend. Or, tell the PC user to sign out of the launcher and log in with the credentials of the PS4 user. Again, once logged in, add the PC user in the friends. Now, the PC user go can back to his account and accept the friend request.

Here, the PS4 user needs to quit the game and relaunch it.

Now, if everything is correct, the PC user can now join the PS4 user by going to the friends list in the game and right clicking the PS4 and selecting Join Party.

**tldr:**

1. PS4 user launches the game
2. PS4 user creates a epicgames.com account
3. PS4 user links account to PSN
4. PS4 user downloads and starts Epic Games launcher on PC

When i started playing Fortnite BR on xbox I did not register to EPIC, what happens is EPIC creates a ""Nameless"" account. To access this account you must sign in (PSN or xBox) Then Register and now you have access to that nameless account.


I disconnected my xbox to that ""nameless"" account and connected my xbox to an EPIC account I made using a different email because it was the main email I use. I did not realize by disconnecting the original nameless account you lose all save data.


Heres how I fixed it:
I signed into my 2nd account, I disconnected xbox live from that epic account, when I did that it appears to have created a 2nd ""Nameless"" account, I had to use a 3rd email, register a 3rd time to Epic using a new email, disconnected my xbox live from that Epic account. Sign into the original ""nameless"" account and then connect xbox live back and then I got everything back. I assume it works the same for PSN, not sure about PC though.


I hope this makes sense and helps people out. 

I did contact customer support prior to disconnecting my xbox account so i could re-connect it to another account, got a response in about a week and they even apologized for the delay explaining the whole ""nameless"" account thing.

THANKS REDDIT!!! I guess someone forwarded my case because I just got an email reply and my issue is resolved. Kinda lame that it took public outcry and I feel bad for all you dudes with issues for weeks who have gone without reply. Honestly, no offense EPIC but your customer support system does need an overhaul or a few more workers.

**This is Epics reply to me below and how my personal issue was resolved:**

&amp;nbsp;


*First of all, I want to apologize for the delay in responding to your ticket. We’ve seen a large uptick in tickets thanks to how supportive players like you have been with the release of Battle Royale, and we’re going to do better. Some good news: I believe this issue can be fixed fairly quickly!
It appears that what’s happening with your account is an issue called platform locking. Unfortunately, right now there is no way to play on PC/PS4 and XBox on the same account. PC and PS4 have the ability to share progression, so accounts are always locked to either Xbox or PC/PS4. If you unlink your Xbox account from this account and relink your PSN account, you should be able to access all of your items and stats once again. You can unlink your Xbox account [here](https://accounts.epicgames.com/login?lang=en_US&amp;redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Faccount%2Fconnected&amp;client_id=007c0bfe154c4f5396648f013c641dcf&amp;noHostRedirect=true)
I can see that you still have your Fortnite and Paragon items entitled to your account, so please don’t worry as they have not been removed. If you encounter any issues relinking your PSN account, please feel free to reach out to me again and I will be more than happy to assist you.*

OP:


This is the WORST customer supprt experience I've ever had to deal with. I submitted my ticket a over week ago and have not got a reply from customer support. Not even that there is zero way to even check the status on my ticket.


&amp;nbsp;


I have lost $50 of in game cosmetics, all my co-op/br stats and complete loss of $40 founder status. Basically the game recognizes me as a noob with zero purchases and fresh free to play account because my PSN was unlinked from your site by accident. Due to a glitch on your end I can't relink it myself and thus have loss access to save the world and all my micro transactions in br.


&amp;nbsp;


This NOT acceptable for someone to be thrown aside like this. ANY OTHER COMPANY would have fixed my issue a week ago. I am patient but not when I have read horror stories of customer support not replying to people for MONTHS if ever. 


&amp;nbsp;


This isn't right.

Like, when ramping up a mountain, you can put it on the last ramp before the mountain, and send any players following you down for fall damage. You could also put a fake floor down and a spike trap beneath it, and any player that walks over it falls into the spikes. 

It would also add some interesting gameplay when assaulting other player’s bases, as you would have to watch out for the fake floors.

I swear my whole squad just doesn't hear it and we often get lost in the storm haha. Now I know that isn't a huge deal but I thought that it would be really cool to have speakers around each town that would make a loud tornado siren warning while the storm is closing in. ALSO a team could get to a town and if they break all 4 or 5 speakers than there wouldn't be any siren anymore: potentially tricking a squad like mine into a false sense of safety when they don't go off.

About a week ago, I was streaming Fortnite on Twitch. I spawned in as usual, got some loot, and begun my way into the storm center. That's when I came across a teddy bear next to a loot chest. I thought nothing of the bear and grabbed my loot, that's when I quickly went past the teddy bear and noticed my reticle turned red... As if it were an enemy. I paused in awe, then I went to a few other random objects to see if I was glitched. I wasn't.

 I then hit the teddy bear with my pick axe and a purple effect spewed from the stuffed bear as well as an odd audio effect played. Staring at my screen in silence, I then looked at my audience and said, ""boys... I think we are on to something."". I quickly headed to YouTube and Reddit to see if others have noticed this teddy bear. It turns out there are multiple bears scattered across the map. Each giving players a red redicle and each emitting a purple effect/sound when you hit them.

What does this mean? Well my stream and I began to theorize. We thought instantly of Call of Duty Nazi Zombies and how in those games when you kill all of the teddy bears it triggers an easter egg of some kind. So, that's when the ideas began to flow. What if we killed every single bear? What would happen? Maybe you get a secret skin for your player? Maybe you instantly win the game? Then I thought... zapatron! 

The zapatron is a gun in game that has yet to be seen in BR. It was told that it is in the game, yet no one has found it. What if, we kill every bear on the map and we unlock this legendary weapon??? It might just be crazy enough to be true. 

For hours we played the game trying to locate all the bears, we went to Salty Springs, Pleasant Park, and other various areas outside of major towns. We killed bear after bear, but we don't think we have located them all.

I purpose with the help of the Reddit community, we can solve this secret! I have tweeted out to Epic Games for a statement, and they will not respond! WHAT ARE THEY HIDING!!! I even tweeted this theory to popular BR player Dakotaz, he liked the tweet out of ALL the tweets to like, he chose mine. We will find out what these bears mean, and it starts here. WHO IS WITH ME?! Let's crack this easter egg wide open!

GL, The Junkler.",FortNiteBR

1. Performance and hitching, although far from perfect, it has been improved. Still a lot of room to get better and I am sure you guys are looking into it.  
2. The implementation of Mini-shields has been fantastic. You don't feel punished for being aggressive or getting into fights early, because you have the chance to shield back up and fight again. And yet it's still balanced because of the limit to 50 max, a great game design choice.   
3. Consolidating and simplifying the traps and launchers was a brilliant idea. Having the flexibility to choose the trap position has increased my trap kills by probably 300%, I love making creative trap positions and item baits now. Removing that clunky trap menu was great idea as well.  
Overall just wanted to shoutout to EPIC for some intelligent game changes that improved the overall game as a whole. Keep it up and Merry Xmas folks. 

EDIT: Just on mini-shields, I wouldn't argue an increase in the cast time. Likely 2.5 to 3 seconds would be a nice balance. ",FortNiteBR

As many of you know, the new shooting model will introduce (so far as we know) perfect accuracy when ADS and added recoil. To further this tremendous shift in gameplay, I was thinking that the introduction of gun attachments should follow suit. This could include vertical grips to help with recoil, muzzle breaks, silencers for assault rifles, and more. I feel that if this was made possible, not only would it bring extra gameplay to the table, but also slightly appease the crowd that don’t want a change in the game. These attachments would, in a sense, bridge the gap between both those who want bloom gone and those who don’t. 

EDIT: Perhaps instead of having to equip each attachment you could earn them by killing others?

Keep it the same!,"What makes fortnite great and splits it from PUBG along with other battle royale games is the shooting and building mechanisms. The shooting is accurate and allows for fast and continuous combat, along with the building to help elongate the fights. I really do wish that you do not add a new shooting mechanism. If I wanted realism, I'd be playing PUBG.

If you add in bullet drop and recoil to unscoped weapons, it's going to slow down the game, and I love the fast paced action this game brings. The new mechanism will destroy long ranged combat, and will add additional difficulty because the game is a third person shooter. Do you know how much more difficult it is to control recoil in third person compared to first? A lot.

Edit: I just think that hitscan suits fortnite. With the feel, look, and style of the game,  I feel like the hitscan combat system compliments that game in a satisfying way... I just don't want it to change, that's all. I think it's fine the way it is.

**Solution/TL:DR at the bottom of this post.**

The random Fortnite crash thats been plaguing gamers. The game will crash/quit in some form and a black window will open:

*Unreal Engine 4 Crash Reporter' An Unreal process has crashed: UE4-FortniteGame*

Its seemingly completely random. Might happen in the first game, every game. Could be three games. You might get a night and it wont happen.

Here's my scenario and things I've tried:

I have four gaming PC's in my house. All with Fortnite:BR. Two of them (one being mine which is the best PC, the other being my daughters which is a half decent potato) have the random crash UE4 problem. On both computers I've tried:

* Complete uninstall/reinstall.
* Copying the installation from the 'good' PC's.
* Different hard drives.
* Update graphics drivers.
* Clean install graphics drivers.
* Complete wipe of every trace of drivers using DDU and reinstall.
* Direct X wipe and reinstall.
* Different levels of graphics settings, effects and resolutions.
* Fullscreen, Windowed, V-Sync, Locked frames.
* Single monitor, dual monitors.
* CPU and GPU stress tests.
* Overclocking on and off.
* Cooling, pumps, fans, air flow.

I could not replicate it, it only happened in Fortnite and it was driving me INSANE!

But then some deep digging got me to discussions about UE4, graphics cards and Windows and how they talk to each other... Which lead to TDR.

**What does TDR do?**

&gt; *TDR once in a while checks that your graphics card is responding. If the graphics card does not respond within two seconds Windows believes that the device is hung and forces it to 're-initialise itself'. This is to prevent the whole computer from freezing as it use to do back in the day.*

********

**The Fix!**

*I take no responsibility if you screw this up.*

* Open Regedit. Click start, type regedit, enter.
* Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
* On the right side, right click, new, Dword 32bit value.
* Name it: **TdrLevel**
* Double click the new TdrLevel to open it and make sure the value is 0 (zero).
* Close regedit.
* restart your computer


A big thanks to the eventual solution! [How to fix ""DXGI Device Removed"" Error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb-ogE1qqfY)

********

I did this fix four days ago on both computers and neither of them have crashed since. My computer I have played Fortnite for a few hours each night and not a single crash. Daughters computer she has barely played, but hers use to crash all the time. But now no crashes.

No guarantee this will work but it has worked for me. I tried everything I could think of. Some things multiple times and in different combinations.

Try it, you never know!

It's starting to feel like this subreddit is catering to a select few people while using vote manipulation to burn others.

The single player in the match that has been chosen to drop in and stand over 200 feet tall...the giant of the map, the player who has seemingly infinite health/hp and a knack for destroying every bogey in town...the giant is making his way inside the circle towards Fatal Fields....you notice gunfire heading his way from the North and South positions, wonderful, this gives you two separate marks at enemies....You flank the enemies to the south and take their loot which so appropriately contained a snowball launcher...you and your teammate covertly tail the giant who is now on a solo mission (Rampage style) to be the sole heir to the Battle Royale Victory chair. Upon obtaining high ground whilst the giant is crossing the river, your teammate shoots his blue burst a few times at the back of the giants head taking off significant health. The giant turns around in a blind range and fires at your teammate much like a Star Wars AT-AT. Unbeknownst to the fact that you're trailing the high ground for a more prolific shot...The giant inevitably retires your partner and pushes forward towards the zone as the storm is rushing inward....you see your shot, you've lined up your golden scar but in the heat of the moment you shift to your snowball launcher and fire the three rockets you have stored...All three snowballs bounce off the giants shoulder and administer damage upon detonation at waist level....the giants health bar is damn near fully depleted. The giant begins to open fire with his common assault, the impact radius of his shots begin to wither away at your health much like the features of a grenade. You turn back to your scar, set up a wall/ramp combo and run to the top and fire a last ditch round at the head of the giant resulting in him withering away as the ELIMINATED font appears before your eyes...The deed is done, his loot was petty but his death was ultimate. You turn to head towards the zone only to meet your wits end by being caught in the storm....not all heroes wear capes...

I'm not sharing them from a salty, or spiteful place, but rather from a place that wants to provide feedback, which can hopefully go towards improvements which will increase the longevity of my time spent in Fortnite, as I find it quite fun - but there are a few nagging issues about it for me.

Firstly, the shooting mechanics in this game are a complete mess. There is a total lack of consistency in spray patterns, especially with the assault rifle. It seems to be no restitution to slowly one-tap as there is a chance your first shot will not predictably align with your corsair. 

Please refer to some of my Twitch Clips...

* https://clips.twitch.tv/SillySpoopyKuduBigBrother

* https://clips.twitch.tv/CogentDirtyPeafowlSquadGoals

* https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudCrazySaladCclamChamp

With respect to the aforementioned clips, this leads to my second issue; RNG does not consistently reward good gun-play. I do not consider it a dangerous axiom to assume that eliminating other players is the core mechanic of Fortnite, or any Battle Royale game for that matter. Having RNG dictate someones ability to do so is essentially denying them a reward for the reason of ""just because"". I've put some thought into why the developers would do this, and the only reasonable conclusion I can come to is because having your back turned and dying, without having time to react, probably isn't a lot of fun. While I can marginally agree with that, it completely unravels the rest of the game for people who have had time to react and do so poorly, but are able to win based off RNG. In my opinion, RNG usually exists where poor balance exists, and the nature of RNG is expected to create that balance.

The inconsistent shooting mechanics is something that very well does bug me about the game. If I was to offer a solution, my solution would be not to remove any type of spray or recoil, but implement it in a predictable way which can become a meta within the game, and more properly reward the people who are engaging when they should, but are being denied.

My final thought on Fortnite so far is the developers need to do more than just watch the first page of Twitch. A lot of people get caught up in the game play of Fortnite, but do not consider the experience for the mediocre player, who is not one of the best in the World. What I mean by that is my round-time consistency is some what of a concern. It is a total coin flip on whether or not the round I am about to play is going to last 2 minutes, or 25. That inconsistency is something that affects the flow of the game to me because I have had nights on stream where it is one-third sitting in queue, then with the random top ten placement. It's an incredibly hard phenomenon to explain, but I hope someone understands it.

Once again, I am not saying these things from a position of saltiness, but rather one that wants to see the game improve!

Now I'm standing on their base in a 1v1, storm closes most of the base, leaving me on the part with broken floors. After repairing some floor pieces, I spot the other guy. After a bit of RPG action, I pull out my legendary sniper. I quickly peek and take out his shield, leaving me enraged and thus pulling out the scar to finish off.

Slurp Potion (Stackable to 2, +1 Health and Shield over the course of 25 seconds for a total of +25 HP and Shield) 

We need more options available that could be of Epic or Legendary quality.  Something like Epic Rarity, Medium casting duration, 75 HP upon use, stacks to 2.

A +100 Shield item with a long duration could be a legendary item only obtainable from a supply drop and isn’t Stackable,  Could look something like the medkits cast time, does not stack, +100 Shield upon use. 

Oh, And we should move Medkits to Legendary quality as well.

While I’m here throwing ideas I also think the idea of having a defibrillator kit (bring back a dead teammate in Duos or Squads) could potentially be something to look at as well. This has the potential to continue making the game more unique and diverse to other Battle Royale games. 

This could potentially make supply drops more sought after towards end game as well.

100 player PvP mode, all parachute into the map, but one to three players start as infected. The goal of the infected is to 'kill' the 97 - 99 regular players, known as ""survivors"". When the survivors die, they respawn as infected. The goal of the survivors is to survive until the timer runs out. Near the end of the game, you'll have only a small group of survivors battling hordes of player controlled infected. I'm not so sure how I would balance the mode, I'd probably give the infected only melee, but have it where one melee attack is enough to kill a survivor.",FortNiteBR

A super rare Pick Axe or costume (or complete reskin of all items) which is FREE. It cant be bought and theres only ten(?) of them (Epic would have to work out how many based on player numbers. It can be all fancy pants looking, or whatever you like to pretty it up.

Its initially handed out at complete random to ten players.

When they have it they use it be default (cant change item).

When they are killed, it drops. Whoever picks it up carries/wears it instantly until they are killed and it drops.

If you win the round you keep the item for the next round, until you are killed and someone else picks it up.

If the carrier is killed and it drops, but is not picked up by the end of the round, it is given to the round winner.

If the carrier dies via storm exposure or suicide the item goes to the round winner.

********

********

The item is visually recognisable but its not a shining beacon for everyone in the map to target. Theres nothing in the game to tell players where the carrier is.

However, in the waiting zone there should be big indicators to players theres a 'super rare item' in the round. Even big arrows and shining lights pointing at the carrier so waiting players will know its going to be in the round.

Imagine the screams of excitement by waiting players knowing there is a super rare item carrier in the game. Rare as in 1 in 1000 games you could see someone with the item. All I hear in my head is Dakotaz saying ""Oh!, theres a super rare in this game! Oh my god!..... Oh, My God!....... oh my god...... oh my god...""

********

********

If the carrier wins then quits the game their account will hold the item for 3 hours. The carrier needs to keep playing if they have the item or, after 3 hours of not playing, it will be given randomly to another player who has just won a round at the time the item became available.

To stop the carrier being team killed and the item being stolen, the carrier is immune to team damage.

********

********

Item carriers game time can be tracked. Not account ownership time but 'actual' game time.

Item perks could be 5x experience when carried(?).

Legendary Hot Potato banner with carry time recorded on it. ""I carried the hot potato for 3min 27sec.""

It could have 3x experience for the item carriers squad. Incentive for the squad to help defend the carrier. Carrier cant be team killed.

If the carrier in a squad is killed and the item drops a squad member CAN NOT pick it up. Only another player can or, if not picked up, the round winner.

If the round winner is a member of the original carriers squad then they are awarded the item. If two or more squad members win then the player with the most kills is awarded the item. If kills are the same then its awarded to the player with the most damage.

Look, this is nothing more than a 'pointless' thing in the game for people to get excited about. People love things like this. A pointless thing you must have! Because its so rare!",FortNiteBR

It's view-only so people can't mess with the original.**

Hello,

After a comment on another thread I got to thinking about the math behind tracking how many daily challenges someone needs to complete in order to hit tier 70 before the season is over. I have created a google spreadsheet that accomplishes this and allows the user to plug in their personal situation and get a customized result. The spreadsheet can be found here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZHvVcU6aLs3446Z-UocS9QzT_5pcZX3FgySS1p6oHp4/edit?usp=sharing

If you want to edit the sheet you will need to either download it as xlsx or save it to your own google drive since the shareable link is view-only. A couple of notes on how to use the sheet.

1. You can replace any of the grey boxes with your own personal information. The rest of the boxes should update automatically when you make a change.

2. Quick note, since everyone starts at tier 1, you technically have ""earned"" 10 stars toward the 700 needed to hit tier 70. Meaning people really only need to earn 690 more.

3. Since you can earn 229 stars from leveling, the most you need to get from challenges is 690 - 229 = 461. Rounding up, that requires you to complete 93 daily challenges during the season in order to hit 70.

4. This assumes that you will hit level 100 to get all of the leveling stars. If this is not the case, you will have to figure out how many stars you are missing out on and do that many more daily challenges (each challenge = 5 stars).

5. This assumes we will be able to gain progress for the season on February 20th itself (Epic's stated end date of the season). That means the season is 69 days long (spanning from December 14th through Feb 20). If you can't actually earn progress for the season on the 20th, this will be off by a single day.

6. The ""last day to buy pass"" assumes that 1) you can still hit level 100 after buying it and 2) you will complete all your daily quests after buying it. If you cannot complete daily challenges every day you will have to build that into your model.

7. This sheet does work for F2P players who want to see what tier they will be able to hit. Just remember it's impossible to hit tier 70 as F2P and you don't get any rewards past tier 35.

*Disclaimer:* I haven't checked all the little scenarios so if someone sees a math error let me know. I can already see this model says the latest anyone who has not leveled at all can buy the pass is on 1/21/2018. I know this is later than the estimate that was given in another post on this sub but I'm not seeing how it is incorrect. There are 63 days left in the season and you need to complete 93 challenges. That means you have to get 30 days of completing two dailies which would be 1/21 when subtracted from 2/20.",FortNiteBR

Last week I made a post listing all the bugs and I'll do so again so we can hopefully see a response and get the new ones fixed.

1. **Players/Bullets passing through player built objects**: I have been on both the receiving end and beneficiary side of this glitch. What seems to occur is if there is any blue on the object (object is slightly damaged or still building) then it acts as though there isn't anything there at all. This happens most commonly with players walking through freshly built ramps but I've experienced it while editing floors and had bullets pass through a brick wall. This one is extremely important and gamebreaking!

2. **Freshly dropped loot can't be picked up**: I think I've gotten to the bottom of this one through some testing of my own. Basically what occurs is when you finish a player in DBNO the game acts as though the player model is still on the ground. This creates a barrier that prevents you from picking up any of their dropped loot. I tested this the other day by swinging my pick axe at the area after I finished a downed player. For roughly 3-5 seconds the pick axe made the sound of me hitting an enemy, even though I was swinging at the air where he previously was. This bug prevents speed looting and is very annoying when in a rush.

3. **Loot Lake Sniper Shenanigans**: This subreddit has been working together to essentially Myth bust this one. The first instance of this was a post made that speculated that pick axes deflected sniper bullets. But after more clips have been posted it appears as though this is simply a bug with Loot Lake. When using a sniper at the Lake the bullets can RICHOCHET back towards the shooter when they hit another player or they simply get deflected and deal no damage.

4. **Semi Auto Snipers make enemies Semi-Permeable**: Excuse my bad humor. But seriously Semi-Auto Snipers go through people sometimes. This has been shown in countless clips on the sub of people shooting enemies who are completely still. Bullets can be seen going straight through enemies.

5. **Player movement is too quiet**: After the latest update player movement is too quiet. Not sure if this is a bug with the new update that has different sounds for different surfaces or if this was intended. But as of right now players can sneak up right behind you and you won't be able to tell before it's too late.

6. **DBNO ""Scurrying"" Animation**: Players appear to be in the DBNO state yet have full mobility and the ability to shoot. This is extremely confusing to enemies who think the player is harmlessly knocked down. Also if a downed player slides down a mountain sometimes they will have a permanent sliding/dust animation and sound once they are revived.

7. **Bullet Sounds**: There's a weird bug where you can hear bullets ""whizzing"" even when no one is shooting at you. This used to happen in spectacting mode but has now leaked to the actual game.

I believe these are the all the major bugs in the game after the latest patch. If I missed any be sure to comment and I'll edit the post. Thanks and let's get these fixed!",FortNiteBR

&gt;
&gt;Whether or not it will be a permanent mode, time will tell.

&amp;nbsp;

It looks like there is a possibility that it could go permanent. I'm guessing that's based off the demand and reception from the user base. I know a lot of people would like a rotating playlist of modes instead of one mode being permanent. I'd like that too if there was an option for more casual play styles. 

&amp;nbsp;

PUBG to me is a more serious aim based battle royale where Fortnite is great because it lets you interact with the environment through building. There is a real void in getting casual players to enjoy the game with friends who take it a bit more serious. Something less intensive like 50v50 for new players and casuals would be a great permanent addition.

EPIC, please re-evaluate the trap system, as this is the first time that I've felt like I wasn't having fun playing Fortnite.","Since the update, all electrical traps have been removed, and the only ""damage trap"" remaining is the spike trap, which can now be placed on walls and ceilings.

This is detrimental to the game for several reasons. First, this means that all traps are completely silent after being placed. Previously, placing a ceiling or wall trap had some risk because they made noise, and could alert an enemy to your position. Now with silent spike traps, players can place multiple traps in a building on ceilings and roofs with no risk of being heard. Previously, setting traps was strategic and somewhat risky, but now there is essentially zero risk.

Second, allowing spike traps to be placed on walls and ceilings is massively overpowered, because it makes them virtually undetectable when entering some buildings. When opening a door, a player shouldn't have to stop and look at the wall, floor, and ceiling before entering. Because of the 3rd person perspective, it's also extremely difficult to see the ceiling of a room you're entering before passing through the door.

This has led to some absolutely terrible experiences in my short time playing since the update. Multiple times, I was killed by spike traps placed immediately inside doorways on either the ceiling or wall. In one case, the spike trap was placed on a wall but was partially hidden by a bookcase. In another case, the trap was placed on the ceiling, and killed me instantly when I walked through a door, with absolutely no chance for me to see the trap or react. 

In one final instance, I built ramps up and jumped into an enemy team's base, only to be killed by a spike trap on the wall that I jumped over. There was literally no way for me to detect this trap from my angle. This was... not a fun gaming experience, to say the least. Previously, I could have at least heard the zaps of a wall dynamo, or seen the spike trap on the ground before I jumped. There needs to be SOME chance to react or identify a trap, before being instakilled. I've now seen multiple teams spam their own bases with spike traps on ceilings / walls at the end of a game, which highly discourages base storming.

This is the first time that I've ever felt genuinely frustrated playing Fortnite, and felt like I wasn't having fun. The new traps have no risk of use, are virtually undetectable after they've been placed on walls / ceilings, and can kill a 100HP player instantly with absolutely no counter or chance to avoid the trap. This is the definition of an unbalances gameplay mechanic, and will only get worse once the majority of players learn that they can essentially lay undetectable instakill traps with zero risk. This gives results in the extremely unpleasant feeling of being punished simply for playing the game.

**TL:DR**

* The new spike traps can be placed on ceilings / walls
* Traps now have no visual or audio cues, and can be hidden in ways that make them completely undetectable to players entering buildings / bases 
* Traps are now essentially unable to be countered, and are potentially game-breaking when placed on ceilings or walls


Epic, please roll back to the old trap system or restrict spike traps to floors before this becomes even more of a problem, and seeps into the meta. ",FortNiteBR

I am told that very low sensitivity is best, but how low is okay?

I see some people move their mouse across their entire mouse pad even a few times just to look left or right.

I am used to sensitivity where I can look around freely with not a lot of movement. I am not sure if this is making my aim bad or not.

I am trying to get used to very low sensitivity to the point where I have to literally move my mouse so much but it feels really really awkward to me.

My question is if I am used to a sensitivity that is not too high or not too low, will I be at a disadvantage in terms of aim and FPS' in general?

I also get confused with how much DPI and in-game sensitivity one should use. My ideal sensitivity is 1000 DPI and 0.11 in game, 0.45 scope and ads. Are these okay settings to become good at aiming?",FortNiteBR

first: I fckin Love your game. You guys did such a great job. 

Many people have problems with earning the 700 stars through dailies and have ideas like earning more stats for the level ups.

My idea: Just implement a weekly quest and a monthly quest like:
- Kill 250 people
- reach 5 times the last 3
- be 20 Times in the final 10
- kill enemies with 6 different weapons
- ...
and reward these with a few Stars (25 for weekly and 50 for monthly).

I think this would make all players happy and is solving the ""star problem"".

Greetings Arilius.

Lately I've been enjoying FNBR more than I used to, especially with the Battle Pass. I think this game will go a long way if the devs are monthly active with nice updates rolling out.

Now there's one thing I'm always thinking about and that is: ""what weapons could fit into Fortnite?""

I'm in love with the Supressed SMG since its introduction and won a solo match with it yesterday.
It certainly is a nice new weapon to use and has a cool design.

But... what more weapons could also be made into the game or even traps or gadgets? Suggestions?

Here are mine:

- Landmine with a minor delayed explosion (can be placed anywhere + triggerable by shooting it)

- Bow and arrow OR crossbow (could be fun to use right?)

- Flamethrower (short range and burning DOT + can quickly burn down wooden structures)

- Raygun (shoots electro bolts + very effective against shields but minor damage to hp)

- Ice chamber (trap that freezes you for X seconds)

- Fire chamber (trap that burns you for X seconds)

- Teleportation trap/tool (not sure which version could work better)

- Blowpipe (mid-ranged and poison DOT)

- More melee weapons?

Solution #1
Teammates sponge bullets, if you grenade near them then you and the player get shellshock and cant shoot for 1-3 seconds (no hp reduction).

Solution #2
If you down a teammate and then they die, you die. This gives incentive to revive your friend if you accidentally shoot them; whilst preventing people running in-front of your gun for the troll. (Include if any other team players shoot the downed player die too - prevents one knocking and one killing)

Solution #3
If you TK then the loot does not drop from your teammate and it simply disappears.

Solution #4 
Start banning people after repeat TK, like COD make it if you TK 3 times in no matter amount of time you get an automatic ban from squads and duos for 1-7 days (maybe it can increase for multiple repeat offenders).

Solution #5
The TK'd player gets resurrected and given god mode to kill only his teammates, then they have to watch the TK'd player dance on their rotting corpses for as long as they so wish! 

I think any of these solutions would vastly help people trust squads and even duos again. I like #'s 1-3 mostly, though also #5 is probably the most sensible.

Upvote if you agree so we can get Epic to see this and potentially change it.

(230 can be earned through levelling to rank 100, the remaining 470 have to be earned through dailies).

 

I think 700 is a fair total, I think it’s achievable and I think it promotes playing the game more. I love this idea. However, some of us can only grind on certain days (Hello kids, jobs, holiday season) and with the event challenges not stacking and only a maximum of 3 dailies stacking it could leave someone grinding hard to level 100 but unable to finish the pass without paying more.

 

My solution? I have two possible ones.

 

1)      Increase every 5th rank from 5 to 10 stars and 10th to 15. Adding another 10 battle pass levels that can be achieved through grinding. Or,

2)      Add challenges that are more long term. Win X amount of times, get X amount of kills etc. All that can add towards it.

 

I prefer the first of course as I think something as good as the battle pass should be grindable but not stuck behind essentially having to log in the majority of days to finish it.

 

TL:DR – Brilliant system but has some flaws to the way it’s earned favouring daily challenges over the levelling. ",FortNiteBR

It has become apparent very quickly just how common shielded enemies are now. With this change which I personally believe is good and helps everyone be more on equal footing. Should bolt action snipers get a slight tweak. Mainly to the damage numbers my thoughts are that a blue will do 100-124 damage generally where it is. Purple will do 125-149 damage and legendary does 150-151 damage. This would actually create a reason to pick up higher rarity’s of bolt action as well as keep them able to once shot enemy’s who are using small shield potions like mad. (Thoughts?). Another change I’d like to see is just to the consistency of grenade launchers could we maybe get them to do the same thing every time. Like maybe they do one bounce and blow up on next contact instead of time based explosions this would make them better for almost everything including long range and just generally the ability to predict where shots are going with them.,FortNiteBR

It is hard to say when I will start to encounter this bug, but my initial testing shows that if the player count drops below 20, the chance that this bug will appear rises sharply.

The peak seems to be at sub 5 players, and when I'm in a final 1v1 the bug has a almost 99% chance of ruining the game. Epic, this is game-breaking! Please look into it, it literally ruins the game for me and many others.

Here are common forms of this bug:

- the aim of all weapons besides RPGs seems to degrade to Farm Ville levels
- any kind of structure you are trying to build becomes a mess and it is hard to select the specific parts you need
- the overall skill-level of my character drops
- movement becomes erratic and critical thinking is nowhere to be found

As soon as the game is over (lost in most cases), all these values return to normal and a fresh game doesn't show these problems - until the lategame bug strikes again.

To be honest, this should be priority #1 for Epic! I really like FBR, but this bug just kills it.

***
**How to drop faster**

As far as I can tell the deployment of the glider in this game is based on how far above the ground you are. Including trees and buildings. So for you my friend this is my suggestion. Plan your drop so that you aim directly at a low, clear patch of ground close to where you would like to go to. 

Bear in mind that you need to keep an eye on the minimap because that will show you your exact location in relation to objects. The third person mode throws you for a loop in terms of your apparent location vs actual location.

**How to drop better**

As people improve and get more used to the game they will find themselves better able to judge how much horizontal vs vertical movement they want to employ when skydiving.

If you are aiming say for the modern looking triple story building on the SW corner of pleasant park. You want your glider to deploy around about the gas station towards loot lake. Not directly above the building. You never want your glider to deploy directly above whatever you are dropping to unless whatever you are dropping to is directly below the Battlebus.

*I always see people deploy gliders way lower than me*

There's two possibilities here, number **one** is that you deployed over a mountain or something else by mistake. Practice will eliminate this. 

Number **two** is an animation thing that I have noticed. If I am seeing someone with a deployed glider for the first time I see them do the glider deploy animation. This gives me the false impression they have just deployed their glider when in fact they deployed it earlier and I am only seeing the animation now.",FortNiteBR

Anywho, cars have been disgussed, I'm sure. I don't know what Epic's stance is, so tell me if it is anti vehicle.

Let's go over the problems with possible cars: 

Small map, cars would be too fast and kinda break the circle system, as we'll a sail negate its use.

Destruction: Buildings and everything are destructible, so collateral damage would have to be calculated.

Weapons: cars would dominate against everything in a flat final circle.

Possible solution? ATV. 
Why: 
ATVs are small and far slower (in theory) than a car or jeep, so wouldn't totally break the game and map if put into practice correctly. 
ATVs are small in terms of hitbix too, meaning they wouldn't be dominant rams, and would be dodgeable.
ATVs leave the driver exposed, so skilled players can pick them easily.
ATVs can carry larger numbers of people depending on mode. Some ATVs are golf cart sized, carrying four or more people, while most can carry one or two. This would leave options for solo, duos, squads, and even teams when 50v50 returns.
ATVs wouldn't need to worry about structural damage. They could be considered non damaging to buildings, aside from perhaps player made wooden forts. 

Related Ideas: 
ATV explosion equivalent to grenade or two, lethal to riders if destroyed.

ATV defense: Fortnite Battle Royale leans on building, and as such I have ideas for defense against ATVs. 

Already implemented defenses: 
Editing floors to have railing placed on ground can trip up or flip ATVs. 
Bounce pads flip them over
Spike traps may puncture tires, or have a slowing effect. 
Pyramids used similar to speed bumps. Hit a patch and you fly.

Non implemented ideas: 
Anti-Vehicle mine/trap to explode, ensnare, or damage ATVs or anything of significant weight
Pothole: trap that essentially is digging a patch of land to trip up or flip ATVs moving at high speed

Personal defense against ATVs:
Weak point treated similar to a headshot on human targets. The ATVs have obvious engine and fuel tank locations that can be hit for bonus damage.

Wanted to make a quick PSA for a daily challenges bug on live. If you accumulate daily challenges, and leave them unclaimed, you can enter a state where you can longer receive daily quests. Less than 1% of players are affected.

We are unblocking everyone affected right now and will have a fix for the bug that causes the issue in January. Until then, try not to let those daily quests accumulate and claim your rewards.

Those of you that have been inconvenienced by this issue will be compensated. Daily Challenges are important to your progression through the Battle Pass, and we don’t want you to miss a thing.

[1:16 PM, Dec 20] UPDATE: The team was determined to fix this issue before the holiday break and they made it happen. The bug referenced above is now fixed. Happy Holidays!

I revived teammates six times and got four kills yet I get less xp than if I had just ignored everything and hid in a bush. The outcome always feels exactly the same leaving little incentive to do anything. 

You only seem to get 50xp for first kill and 20 additional after that but only 20. So no matter how many kills you get 70 xp max. Why not 50xp per kill? 

Survival time usually ranges from 100-250 iirc which okay that's not really an issue as they could not account for that at all I suppose. 

No xp for building, looting, chopping things for resources? When you win a game you only get 25 xp more than the next few spots? 

I feel there should be more xp opportunities than there are currently. Maybe even challenge wise too. Travel x km, use x lumber/bricks/metal, etc. 

I just had one of my best games and only got 206 xp? Compared to 300 if I hide long enough to be top 15.

Do you think they'll adjust xp in the future? This is one of the few games that leaves me feeling completely empty when my round ends and I go back to the home screen. Then I see the star system and my xp inching and start stressing out about the grind ahead. 

The reward doesn't seem very big for winning despite the very small odds of doing so and the rewards as you play don't seem to add up to much leading to it being better to just hide all game to maximize your xp gain. 

I'm still not even rank 10 battle pass wise. Why they couldn't just tie rewards to your player level instead of this separate star system is beyond me. 

Compared to a game like call of duty that throws a million badges and medals at you for the most minute of actions in flashy fashion and leveling up very consistently it feels discouraging having very little happen for you in this. Make fun of the cluttered noisy post match display in those games all you want but you always feel like you're progressing and your efforts are being encouraged and rewarded.

*TL;DR - We’ve updated our Stats tech, but will not be able to backfill stats until January. New year, new tools for the backfill!*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Stats Tech Update**
&amp;nbsp;    
We very recently rolled out a new Stats backend database technology, and this allowed us to better support the massive amount of you racking up Royales on the weekends. For example, this past weekend we were able to keep stats online, whereas with the older system we would have had to disable them.

&amp;nbsp;    
**Stats Backfill Update**
&amp;nbsp;    
With the new system we are implementing new tool that is necessary to support the backfill (currently in progress). Once everything is stable and fully tested we will give you specifics on when exactly we plan to backfill stats in January!   
&amp;nbsp;      
We appreciate all of your patience while we wrangle all those stats, and the new system/tools will ensure better stats stability now and into the future!

*****
Me and 2 other people landed on the small mountain next to the river with the orange bridge. 

I went fast in the house's roof, took a gun and killed one of them. Then I saw the 2nd guy without a gun hidden behind a fence looking at me.

I waived at him and showed him the ""lol"" emoticon. He came close, and I dropped him a gun. So we went into the house, we looted it and then we moved on together.

The communication was pretty bad, and he almost killed me after he thought I was an enemy who we encountered. I rushed the enemy guy, while he was drawing his attention. After I killed him, my new friend came at the kill scene, but he didn't know if I was his friend or the enemy. He started shooting me and I started jumping around like a maniac waving ""no"" with my body and gun.

Afterwards, we moved further into the circle and we hid in two bushes next to each other. 

At last, there were 4 people alive; the stranger, me, and 2 enemies. I rushed out of the bush to go to loot boxes, and got snipped :(

He died also after 3 minutes.

I friendinvited him, after he died and saw his name, and we played a couple of games. Unfortunately, he can't speak English, and he kept speaking Russian with me.

Fuck any of you that do this shit.

If friendly fire has to be a thing and can’t be disabled, why can’t FortniteBR implement auto-kick for teamkilling in the same way other games do?

As it stands there seems to be every incentive to kill your random teammates, and no actual deterrent against it.

Currently, bandages heal you for 15 HP and take 3 seconds to use. The new potions heal you for 25 HP and take 2 seconds to use. In gun battles, especially in solos, it is super frustrating for someone to build some walls and drink 1 or 2 Mini Potions real quick. The way it used to be, players were disincentivized from trying to heal mid-battle because you could shoot down their walls no problem and catch them potting up. But not anymore. 

Here are the changes that I think would bring some parity. 

- 50 Shield Potions - **Orange, and with a *slightly* higher drop rate than the Bush Potion.** Heals you all the way up to 100 shields. Carry up to 2 in an inventory slot.
- Slurp Potion - Purple, keep exactly as is.  
- Mini Potion - **Blue, drops 2 at a time, carry up to 4 in an inventory slot. 5 seconds to consume.** Heals 25 up to 50 shields. 

Having the ability to carry 250 HP in shields in one inventory slot is ridiculous. It needs to be changed. ",FortNiteBR

* No bullet spread.
* A lot more recoil (at least on assault rifles and the semi auto sniper)
* Damage falls off when hitting people over long distances
* Purple scar hits in the body for 29.5 with a 1.5x headshot multiplier for 44 damage

With damage falling off over longer distances and the increased recoil, assault rifles are a lot less effective at long range. This encourages using sniper rifles more because you can't just spray across the map with a gold Scar.

I would love to know what other changes you guys noticed and hear your thoughts on how you think these changes will impact the game.

Uhm, it is only if you continue shooting the way you got used to shoot.

Tons of easy to notice improvements after a couple of games and a couple of wins:

1. Recoil actually has a pattern now on automatic weapons which is easier to control. Do. Not. Spam. Spamming now makes your gun tick off weirdly. Use the CSGO approach for shooting. 
2. Shotguns are way better than they were in CQ. I would argue they feel way easier to land headshots now.
3. If you feel that aiming is an issue then the sensitivity might be a problem and not the actual changes regarding to gunplay. I feel the sensitivity has a bigger impact now than it did before. So you need to tune that properly.
4. There's a lot more skill now required to land shots and you are less dependant on RNG. The game suddenly got a lot more competitive to be honest. Also the gunplay feels way more rewarding now. Because it's fair.
5. Crouching is not as necessary as before. 
6. You can even control the recoil while jumping. That's fantastic. 
7. Damage fall off. Forgot to add this yes. I'm so happy for this to be honest as you can't get snipped with a shotty or revolver so easily.

Haven't got a chance to play too much with the snipers but from what I can tell I think the balance is quite good. Less randomness but definitely not laser beams.

I’ve tried to learn. I’ve tried to pick up techniques. I’ve tried to change my approach. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING works. I downloaded this game hoping for good times, but I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown now. 

I consider myself to be a pretty laid back person. It takes a lot to make me get red hot angry. This video game has done that for me. It pushed me over the edge. Jesus Christ, I threw a goddamn temper tantrum and I’m a grown man. I’ve also about destroyed a pair of really nice headphones from throwing them off my head.

Fortnite is unfair the second you jump out of the battle bus. You can land in a spot that has always been reliable in providing a chest or two and find nothing. Or you do find a chest and it’s a shitty smg. 

Nowhere is guaranteed to have the best materials either. You can be shit out of luck for surviving the endgame based on where you land. I just had a game where I struggled to loot, and then I couldn’t find enough material around me. You can probably guess how that game turned out.

Even if it’s all smooth gravy, which I’ve had happened a few times, you still will manage to be fucked over somehow. There are too many bullshit deaths that have happened to me to count them all. I’ve had full health and full shield and got killed by two single bullets. I wish I was fucking kidding. I’ve called bs so many times. People with shotguns bunny hopping, people easily cutting down my structures like butter, you name it.

Want to hide behind objects for cover? Fucking awful idea. You’re better out in the fucking open, and that’s not even much of an improvement. It’s such bullshit how you can’t construct a 1x1 just because a tree is like 1 foot away. There’s no time to cut it down, because you have a bullet with your name on it coming any second. I just lost a match because of this.

You’re not even anywhere close to safe when you build either. Like I said. It doesn’t matter what material you put up. It can be destroyed in like 1-3 seconds. This gives me no time to think about what to do. I’ll often keep putting up a wall over and over until I run out, or fuck up the placement. Also, I can’t switch between materials and types of builds easily. When I’m being shot at from every direction, I can’t logically remember what material I’m on or construction. I’ll often be viciously rolling my scroll wheel trying to find the right thing, and up, its too fucking late.

This happens with guns as well someone up and comes out of the blue shooting at me wi5hout any warning or hint and I have to panic to find my shotgun for close range.

Even if I am in full control of the situation, or the aggressor, I can’t kill anyone either. I have to fire like half of my ammo to secure a kill if I’m lucky to not die in the process. More bullshit often times. Then there’s the fucking retards who bunny hop. It’s so annoying and not fair. It puts me at a huge disadvantage and them at an advantage.

I’ve gotten my hopes up too many times. I have a good run, find all the good guns, and have that taken from me before I have time to react. I die a little inside each time I see someone run over my corpse and steal my guns.

Then you have to put in all that labor all over again, and keep hoping you’ll do good. It’s almost like gambling. 

I bet this thread is going to get downvoted into oblivion but I don’t care. I needed this. To vent. It’s more goddamn frustrating than you can imagine. I think I’m ready to uninstall the game. If you can convince me to keep playing, great. But I think it might be best for my sanity if I didn’t play this game anymore.

As soon as people used the bush once or twice, it became a ""no thanks"" item.  

I played a ton of Fortnite Battle Royale this weekend and was shocked to see how irrelevent the item is.  I've never seen anyone win with it and rarely see players use it in the top 10.  It feels like such a waste at this point.

There is one random gun in the game, for example, only snipers, only ARs. Etc. Rarity Varies

- CAPTURE THE FLAG
Game is divided into 2/3/4 sections (can’t think of how many teams there should be) and every team has 3 minutes to loot their divided section (other sections will be a 10 DMG a second storm for this time period) and the flag will be in a random spot in that section. Full map will be available after the time period. Every team a player on a team dies, a smaller spotlight will shine on that teams flag on the map until eventually going to just the location. Less players = easier to find their teams flag because there couldn’t be a circle in this game mode

- GUN GAME
First player to get a Kill with every gun of every rarity will players going back on the Battle Bus after a death. Normal SMG-Normal Pistol-Normal Revolver etc.

- INFECTED
5 random players are it (not just 1 to avoid it being one really bad player or someone afk) or 2-3 random teams. When they kill someone they become infected and when the infected are killed they respawn at a random spot in the circle. The last player/team alive wins.",FortNiteBR

I like the friendly fire option, imo i think it makes the game much more tactical, but if people keep team killing i think its best to get rid of it all together.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit: &amp;nbsp;**
**Just some of the key things I really enjoyed about 50v50.**

&amp;nbsp;

- It made it easier for casual players to help the team.
- Jumping off the bus was insanely fun, because you never knew if you were going to land in the middle of your squad or the enemy.
- End game buildings were larger and it helped less skillful shooters to still contribute by rebuilding/building walls.
- More than 3 other people were looking out for you.
- Getting to see more of the island by walking as a group.
- Firefights were larger scale.

It is the worst aspect of FNBR gameplay and seen as EPIC are so good at listening to their gamers why not provide them with some ideas on fixes.

Personally, I think a 'karma level' system would be a good way of maintaining the current gameplay, providing a decent prevention system (ban warnings don't work) and also provide a punishment for players who team-kill.

The karma system would work similarly to that of Fallout where the more you partake in team-killing the worse your karma will get and the more period of time you go without team-killing the better your karma will be.

Players with bad karma will only be matched with other players with bad karma and good karma players will be matched with each other. This way players who team-kill will be matched with each other and can spend their time fighting over each others early loot whilst players who actually want to enjoy team-work can play the game how it should be played.

Additionally, you could reward players for sharing weapons in the same way by giving them karma bonuses etc. It would also provide negative karma players with a chance to redeem their reputation by playing games without team-killing and sharing weapons etc. 

Karma levels would be able to be viewed next to your health bar in the top left so your team are able to note how wary they need to be of their team-mates. This way if a good karma player was matched with bad karma players he could avoid them by dropping elsewhere rather than being immediately team-killed.

Please post your thoughts on this idea below, or if you have an alternative I would love to get a discussion going on how we could improve this area of gameplay.

TL;DR Team-Killing = Bad Karma. Bad Karma players are placed in squads with other Bad Karma players.",FortNiteBR

Maybe I'm just getting old but none of the recent shooters have really hooked me how the 1st Modern Warfare or Gears 2 did. None of the new CoDs excite me anymore, Halo and Gears aren't what they used to be,  I couldn't get into Overwatch no matter how hard I tried, and I've never particularly enjoyed the Battlefield series.

Along came FortniteBR and I feel like a little kid again. As someone new to the BR genre I'm constantly itching to play and improve. Gunfights really get your blood pumping unlike anything I've ever played and the payoff for outplaying your opponents is addicting. Every time I die I want to know what I could have done better, want to learn the best looting spots, how to build more effectively, etc. It's legitimately fun being a ""noob"" again (only 3 solo wins so far with a couple hundred games). 

The cherry on top is the fact that this game is FREE... like what?? Thank you EPIC for reminding this old timer why I fell in love with shooters in the first place.

I thought that only a slight arc was going to be added--not one that shows the entire path of the grenade. If grenades were a bit more obvious when they are thrown (like the grenade launcher or RPG) then it might not be so annoying, but as it currently stands, someone just has to pre-aim and find that exact arc in order to Kobe a grenade right next to you. 

Perhaps grenades should be louder when thrown, or they should now have a longer fuse time to compensate. Honestly, though, I'd just as soon see the grenade arc itself be dialed back a bit to bring back the skill element to tossing grenades. ",FortNiteBR

Unfortunately there were no chests at the tree and about 5 enemies landed on the burger place. I had little choice really but to run straight into the burger place and there I was lucky enough to pick up a white SMG and a shield. As soon as I finished drinking the shield I was attacked by a guy with a gold scar and shields and somehow I managed to land every shot for a headshot in my panic to drop him and I survived with 6hp. I used the scar to win the battle for Greasy Grove. 

Fast forward to the end game and I'm on 8 kills with 3 enemies remaining and have built my base on one of the hills near the crates area close to Lonely Lodge. I’m in a gunfight with a player in the base adjacent from me and I don’t hear until the last second a player building a ramp up to my base  to rush me.  He shot an RPG shot at me but luckily for me, I had around 160 odd health from shields and it didn’t 1 shot me. I start shooting back with a tac shotgun and destroy his ramp just at the right time and he fires the rocket again as he’s falling and hits the wall of my base and promptly kills himself. 2 enemies left. 

Before I can even start to repair my base the guy I was previously fighting starts pounding my walls with a scar and hits me 1-2 times while I’m spamming new walls in front of me with around 20 health. I thought I was fucked because he was going to get that last shot through sooner or later but out of nowhere he stops shooting and I notice on the killfeed that he got sniped. It’s now 1v1. 

I have a quick look and see the tracer coming from a bush right in the open! I quickly repaired my base and healed, all the while watching the bush. He must have thought I didn’t notice him or something because he remained in that bush, making for an easy snipe for my 9th kills to win a match that I really shouldn’t have won 😊

!= means more important fix
crossed out  means thinking on it maybe too much a reach, not a good idea, or you guys already did it 

•	!First off, as good as this game is there are two huge problems with this game at the moment: random bullet spread and shield potions. Looks like you guys are doing stuff about the bullet spread which is good, but how about you make the rng of the bullet spread significantly less (for AR’s) until the new shooting comes out? And shields are quite a problem. A ‘rare’ item which can bump you up 50 hp is ridiculous. I personally think you should rework shields as a whole.


•	!Add, in addition to kill counter, ‘team kills’ counter. Adds up all of your teams’ kills (obviously not in solo) for a counter next your solo kills. (three skulls instead of one to signify)



•	!Dramatically increase AR accuracy: It is a bit too random right now (will be aiming right on a guy and bullets will go all around him because of RNG) – you guys just did this: good job but still needs a tad bit more accuracy: if I aim exactly at the head the bullets should not go all around it. More on this: you guys said you want to maybe get rid of RNG but I don’t like that. I think you guys should just make the RNG window extremely small so it’s very accurate up close to medium but medium to far you can’t just melt with a AR bc no dropoff range. If you guys had no RNG with no dropoff range it would be insane. Pls with the new shooting model don’t use falloff damage. Too big a change


•	Improve building: sometimes it will build a tiny wall in the ground and also I can’t build at times. Has gotten me killed quite a few times. Eh I’ve gotten used to it



•	!Buff grenade launchers: make it where you can choose when to detonate? Hold RT to shoot let go when to detonate. Or detonate on impact? Right now they are a little bit too random.


•	Explosive radius seems very inconsistent. I will shoot right next to the with a rocket and not kill them or sometimes not even damage them while the shoot pretty far from me and kill me. Make this more consistent. Maybe make RPG’s only come legendary and are as powerful as before but take ages to reload? Rockets more rare?



•	Make picking up grenades go toward the grenade launcher as well


•	Add grenade arc: to see where grenades go  


•	!Decrease grenade bounciness, impact grenades? Please change grenades to impact. Right now way too bouncy/random



•	Add more weapons: been doing more research and you guys have all sorts of weapons in save the world you could easily integrate into BR. Semi auto rifles is one I really want to see.


•	Add purple (epic) and yellow (legendary) versions of each and every weapon? Could be cool to find a yellow tactical shotgun or yellow revolver



•	Add name for jail, industrial plant, container place, carnival, and others on map. ‘Juicy Jail’ and ‘Pretty Plant’ for example.


•	Buff the container place. Or replace it or something. Right now it plain sucks



•	Buff/change moisty mire


•	Add a bit more named areas and structures on the map. Sometimes will be wandering for quite some time without stumbling upon a compound, village or city. New named structure between Pleasant Park and Greasy Grove. Right side has good space between but the left side has way too much plains. Looks like you guys are doing this! Sweet



•	Add potion pouch. Could carry up to 3 potions and if you want more It would use one of five inventory slots like now – could be cool but idk how you would implement ehhh


•	Add loot boxes. Separate from season and item shop. Can buy and will give random reward. Can give items not available in the weekly or daily shop. Make it so only way to buy these loot boxes is with v-bucks and getting victory royales! Give hardcore players like myself chance at earning cosmetics although getting wins is tough. Maybe not loot boxes but earn a small amount of v-bucks for kills and wins? 1 v-buck for kill 10 v-bucks for wins? Would still be very grindy but something  Maybe not v-bucks but next point: Kinda did this with battle pass. Would like to see more cosmetic unlockables for free



•	On battle pass: There should be no difference in ‘tiers’ and ‘levels’ too confusing 


•	Add more level rewards for seasons! Level 25 is way too low for highest and much potential. Level 10- Banner. Level 25- Glider. Level 40- Axe. Level 65- Outfit.  See above



•	Be able to choose characters instead of it being chosen randomly for you when you don’t have an outfit


•	!Buff axe damage: right now it is 10 hits for a kill when they have 100 hp. Should be 3-4 hits for kill to make it not nearly impossible to get a kill when someone finds a weapon before you at the beginning. Add headshots to axe hits?



•	Add leaderboard at end of match that shows: winner, most kills: only problem with this would be almost all people leave after their team dies so how would you see leaderboard of a game you’re not in?  post-game stats ?


•	Add super storm. A random red circle on the map which drops lightning bolts randomly and can shock people in it. Very similar to PUBG’s red explosion circle. (sorry I don’t know name I’ve never played PUBG I’m on console. Or a tornado! Have seen this on save the world. Maybe these elements will destroy structures as well?! Eh maybe not






•	Buff jump pad somehow: Almost useless now with launch pad eh maybe not. Can be useful for no fall damage



•	Add yellow ‘legendary’ tier traps! Seeing the launch pad I’m sure you guys can come up with some awesome stuff!


•	Add more characters to BR. Some from save the world? Make it so you can choose your character and maybe have to unlock some from playing the game! You guys are doing this your own way



•	Make it so you can choose which of the base characters you want to be. Or a way to unlock (maybe as you get higher level)


•	Add weapon camos! Weapon animated camos? (like the glider I forgot what it is called (prismatic maybe))



•	Potential new map: Complete copy of save the world map? I have only seen clips on save the world gameplay but I see differences in map from the BR version.


•	Add on to map and make a little bigger?



•	!make being able to shoot trhough windows easier. Right now difficult because crosshair is greyed out


•	Fix friend’s leaderboards on Xbox and I believe PS4. They have never worked. Update: the work now but are almost pointless/. Can’t even see how much wins they have. You should be able to see wins, wins this week, games played, average kills, downs/downed. Score and top 10 places for just the week is silly. Also scrap the leadboards how they are. Have them like call of duty. Can see top 100 of all time, this week, and month



•	!Storm should be see through easily on both sides. Right now players in storm are at advantage because it is so hard to see them. If anything it should be the other way around.


•	Advanced stats: Have KDR, most kills in a game, k/d of downs/downed’s. actual kills/deaths. – you guys kind did this with post-game stats but see below



•	Add a leaderboard for squad and whole game for these post game stats. Who has the most damage in your squad/game? Right now post game stats are cool but no one really checks after the first few times they use. Would love to see how I stack up against my squad mates and everyone else in the game


•	!Possible band-aid to shield fix: Lower the rare shield item to 25/15 shield, maybe add purple and yellow variants of 50/30 and 75/100/45: Shields are currently too common for how useful they are. Maybe even lower amounts of shield considering how powerful they can be. Maybe 15 (rare) 30 (epic) 45 (legendary). Or 20 40 60. I would rather just change shields from 50 a pop to 15-25. Maybe even rework shields. Maybe max shields is 50?



•	Another possible shield fix: 50 max shields. Rare shields: 25, purple  (epic): 50. Legendary: slurp


•	Add more consumables? Make you run faster. Etc



•	!Show everything you would while spectating. So you can see kills, ammo, loot, map, everything of player you’re spectating. Be able to check map


•	Add killcams (which also show that players loot and kills same as above with spectating) 



•	!No-fill option on duos


•	!‘Trios’ playlist. Teams of 3 – seems I always have three and we don’t want to be with a random. Puts me at disadvantage



•	!Revamp on how using/picking traps works. It’s a bit wonky right now sometimes too hard to get in heat of the moment. Could keep the same but when you have a trap selected (the one showing on menu) and try to use it it is wonky. Menu is not that bad just equipping is buggy


•	!Remove hit detection when using silenced smg. They won’t know where damage is coming from. right now the silenced smg is kinda silly





•	!Add more places to the left side of the map. Right side has over 10 good locations while left side has about 2-3. You guys are adding the city but need more



•	Add one more inventory slot just for consumables/grenades. 5 slots for anything (can be consumables/grenades and 1 slot designated for consumables/grenades. Right now hard to find room late in games for these new items like the bush and smoke


•	Make shotgun shells rarer? This would have more people to use smgs as they use light bullets and that is very abundant but obviously shotguns are better. Or just buff the smg even more lol



•	Game still says ‘closed beta’ in launch/load screen on xbox. Not sure if intentional or haven’t got around to changing it


•	Revamp hud for team names. Kind looks outdated ;)  Same with gun icons. Grenade looks cool it is 3d and very nice looking ;)



•	Slurp revamp: unused health should go towards shield. Maybe change slurp to yellow/legendary? So if you have 91 HP, it would give you 9 HP and 41 shield and if you have 51 hp you get 49 health and 1 shield. Obviously it would be halved if shields are capped at 50 like I talked about before;) Right now slurp wastes a lot of potential health as you need to be 75HP only for it to work best.


•	!Downed in lakes make you both invisible and invisible . Pls fix



•	Ability to zoom into for fortnite map with d-pad


•	Run faster with axe or meds out (like fists)



•	Bug where if you aim at someone on the start island you will trigger aim assist and if the game starts while aiming at someone you will forever turn until you get out. 


•	Mechanic against killing people immediately after downing? Just a thought



•	Only one revive per down. For example if you go down if squads/duos and get revived the second time you go down you are insta-dead? Or maybe each time you go down you will bleed out faster and faster. This would help avoid downing people and they just keep reviving over and over


•	!Wins count as medal or star towards the battle pass



•	Kill streaks? Or something to reward players for getting kills? 3 kills – shield potion or something. Just a thought ehh maybe not


•	!Buff burst ar accuracy. Right now 90% of people will choose full auto over burst



•	Trophy system legendary ‘yellow’ tier trap. Not infinite uses. Will destroy a certain amount of explosions


•	Proximity chat



If someone from Epic actually reads this, I just want to say what a great job you guys are doing with this game. The fact that a game this good and gets these amazing updates weekly  is free is insane… I have logged over 100 hours +  &gt; 65 wins  ( now 90 wins ;)) (now 100 wins;)))))and wanted to share some ideas I have had to make the game ever better. I’m sure you guys have through of a lot of these already. Keep up the great work

 I usually have plenty of friends online to run squads with, but the other night I was alone and felt like completing the daily quest that involved playing squads. The first game I was killed by my teammate for no apparent reason, and immediately after killing me he built and jumped off a set of steps, falling to his death. Game number two was a blast, finding a group of three that were working together great, and without even being in voice chat we easily won the round. 

 Coming off of an exciting win, with decent fellow players I was feeling pretty good about playing out one more to finish the quest, but the next team I played with pailed in comparison to the last. After landing in retail and clearing the city, I gave my med kit to the one player that had fallen and was revived. We were moving out of the town when we were ambushed, but emerged victorious, however one of the team sustained injuries. Nothing that a slurp wouldn't fix so when I found one I brought it to him. Not realizing the rest of the team was playing around attempting to trap me under a pyramid roof piece. I started to make my way towards the next zone when all of the sudden my team mates opened fire on me. I was surprised at first and thought maybe it was an accident and turned quickly to fire a warning shot back. This stopped the friendly fire but only for a moment. I was quickly knocked by two of the three teammates but not eliminated. The 4th player came running over in an attempt to revive me, but was unable to convince the others as they opened fire again to eliminate me. Here is the footage of the event for anyone that cares to watch. https://youtu.be/70WvtrG1u-4

 In game chat, the one player that was NOT shooting me was talking to me apologizing for his ""douche bag"" teammates. He told me he was also going to report them to epic. I have reported the one player that started shooting at me, and eliminated me. Hopefully Epic is as serious about this issue as they say they are. I do not want them to take away friendly fire damage, but sincerely hope they find some way to combat this toxic aspect of a game that is otherwise very fun to play. 

TL;DR
Dbag team mates use my med kit and kill me out of gratitude

I love the game itself but the constant teamkilling is unbearable and Epic is doing nothing about it. Goodbye.,"A week ago I ranted about how I got killed by two teammates that I had revived. I've been teamkilled several times since then but what just happened is the nail in the coffin.

We all decided to drop Flush Factory. It was near the end of the bus route and with the exception of one straggler that we took care of, we had Flush Factory all to ourselves. I lucked out and found a legendary assault rifle and a legendary grenade launcher: its the first time I've ever found any legendaries in chests. I also found two shield potions and plenty of ammo. Best loot I've ever had.

By the way, none of the loot I took was anywhere near a teammate. They weren't talking and we had Flush Factory to ourselves so I assumed we were just going to get what we got. 
As we're about to leave, all three of them just gun me down point-blank range. They didn't say anything, didn't T-bag, didn't jump up and down, made no indication that they wanted anything. There weren't any enemies nearby either. Absolutely no reason for them to kill me other than my loot, which I didn't 'steal' from them by any means: we all hit up a ton of loot.  I'm not even sure that they saw what I got anyway. I was prepared to give them something regardless, had they made any attempt to communicate at all.

I message one of them a simple ""Why?"" and he immediately invites me to a party. I join and all three of them are talking to each other. They start yapping about how I should've given them something, how I'm super salty, etc. They're clearly all kids, maybe 8-11. I leave the party but continue to watch them play. They made it towards the end through stealth, but die the very first teamfight they get in, and barely use the guns they took from me. By the way, I have no problem with teammates being incompetent, I literally just want them to stop killing me.

On PS4 this happens to me at least once every four games, on bad nights it's every other game. I try to be as courteous as possible: I don't give our position away, I don't steal kills, I don't take loot that a teammate is clearly heading for, I give them a gun if they don't have one, etc. 

This game is plagued with teamkillers and removing friendly fire would treat a symptom but not the problem. People would find other ways to troll, like giving the team's position away, destroying their forts, and boxing them in.

I report teamkillers every time but we all know that does absolutely nothing. While this game is fun with my friends (who rarely play this game with me), Epic does not care about solo players at all. I could play solo matches more often, but those aren't as fun as squad matches - I feel like that's the way the game is meant to be played. At least on PS4, squad matches essentially require you to play with friends. Most of the times I get teamkilled, it's clear that my teammates are talking to each other outside of the built-in chat.

I would say it was a good run but that would be a lie. Goodbye guys, I'll uninstall this game as soon as I need space for a game whose devs actually care about it. Rant over. Sorry for the wall of text, if you actually read this.

TL:DR teamkilling is an epidemic on PS4.",FortNiteBR

1) helping a teammate get up to 30 health when they are below 30 health
2) killing team killers once they start shooting at me

Some cons I've noted are:
1) getting killed for a gray submachine gun
2) having a team of three friends turn on me, especially as I play without a mic
3) very hesitantly picking up scars because I know it will make me a target
4) accidentally sniping a teammate as the walk directly in front of me or potentially exploding a teammate if they build in front of an rpg shot
5) the biggest con of all, frequent and passionate fits of rage

Granted, I've seen team killing go down as Epic has encouraged people to report them, but why not eliminate team killing entirely in duos and squads as was done in 50v50?  I've reported my fair share of team killers, but I think the problem is that some people are not habitual team killers, but strategic team killers who will kill a teammate for their weapon every once in a while. It seems to me that 50v50 very effectively eliminated the entire team killing issue with a very simple fix. 

What are your thoughts?  Are there any benefits to allowing friendly fire in duos/squads that I haven't noted?",FortNiteBR

As someone who works 5 days a week this is near impossible without using v bucks. 

Now I understand I can reinvest the free vbucks to help me but that only takes off a couple of days. Players should be rewarded crowns if they make it to the top 3 or higher. Also higher season levels should reward more crowns e.g 98-99 only gives 1 crown atm, imo it should Increase as the ranks get higher:

1-30 should reward 1 crown

31-60 should reward 2 crowns 

61-90 should reward 3 crowns 

91-99 should give 5 crowns

(unless its a 5 or 10 crown reward)

This would make it do-able for alot more players as many will struggle to reach the top tiers by february.

Feel free to tell me that it is balanced and i just want to get the items quicker but we all know thats not the case infact I love the grind, I just want to make sure I get my moneys worth.

Just wanted to put that on here in case someone didn't know that

Also, when you're 5 slots on your inventory are full and you run across some loot from a kill/chest/crate that you just HAVE to pick up but don't have any space for it and aren't willing to give up something else in your 5 slots for that said thing, I have a little trick for you:

- You have to have at least 1 Trap in your inventory
- Open up your build mode
- Equip a trap as if you're about to set it up against wall, etc
- Go up to the item you want to pick up and press the button 
   to pick up the item while the trap is still on your screen
- Profit

What will happen is your trap is going to drop and you're going to pick up whatever item you wanted. That item will be randomly put into one of your 5 slots in your inventory and then the item that this newly picked up item replaced in one of your 5 slots will go into your inventory but will not be on the screen. So you can re-adjust you weapon setup back to how you want it. The only thing is that whenever you reload whatever weapon you have in your hand at that moment, the extra weapon/item that is in your bag that isn't showing in your 5 slots will automatically drop. This can help a little bit if you don't have to go to far to get into a circle and are running from the storm and just need to pick up a slurp juice/another shotgun or whatever.

Also wanted to let Epic know this too in the case that they want to patch this out.

P.S: I'm actually not 100% sure if this still works with the new way the inventory management is.

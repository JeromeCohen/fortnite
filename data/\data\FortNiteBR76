Fortnite has always had a lot of interesting items and mechanics that have changed as the seasons have passed. I applaud Epic that they‚Äôve been willing to take chances by putting things in the game that may alienate some, like the game-wide glider redeploy in Season 6 and the 50hp/shield pool on kill currently in now.

Maybe I‚Äôm a vocal minority on this sub, but I genuinely liked (most) of the items that Epic added into the game. I liked boomboxes, C4, planes (and while not the greatest idea, chiller traps were fun for a bit before this sub complained about them into oblivion). 

I‚Äôve been playing since season 3 and have about 100 total wins at this point and you know what? I genuinely liked the items Epic added, and that they provided a counter to building. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be a popular opinion on this sub, but I will stick by it.

Fortnite right now really seems to be not the zany and fun game it used to be and devolved into a shotgun build battle simulator every. single. fight. Ar‚Äôs are so rare to find now, deagle nerfed, planes vaulted and rpgs in supply crates only that building is the strongest it‚Äôs ever been in this game.
 
This game is losing casual players fast. I‚Äôm not sure what direction Epic wants to take the game in, but right now it definitely seems like they are more e-sports focused on providing the greatest boon to pro-players and disregarding casual ones.

Battle-Royales are supposed to be random and fun. The RNG element is central to every game, and I know this goes against the e- sports mantra, but Fortnite is rapidly becoming more and more of a skill based building/shooting game then a true Battle Royale when it first launched.

The siphon hp/shield kills and the nerf/vaults of all the previously mentioned items have astronomically sky rocketed the skill level in this game around building. I‚Äôm hoping we can get a return to form soon.

tl;dr: Epic has removed almost every counter to building so the game is shotgun build battle simulator with very little incentive to deviate from the meta, leading to large build battles/high skill ceiling this game hasn‚Äôt seen before.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

As much as i like this addition in solos, making kills actually mean something, but in squads and duos it makes it extremely annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

This addition makes fortnite more competitive, (again which i love) The only problem is fortnite is widely played casually, by Casual players who play with there friends. But casual players quit if there friends die, Which in turn, can lead people to not want to play fortnite 

&amp;#x200B;

***How to fix This.***

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of getting the materials and health for your kills, You should get the health and HP from your kills once you eliminate the opponents full squad.

I believe that this should be how the shop's skins should be moving forward, because it:

a) Allows us to finally be able to see what the backbling looks like on other skins.

b) No more buying skins for a backbling.

c) Allows for Epic to add new backblings to old skins, especially green ones, and monetize them.

The biggest issue with this change is how they would price of the skins if this model was the new standard but   I believe that breaking up the prices currently given for skins with backblings into a price for each that add up to the original pricing would work, for example

Common Skins: How the Fatal Fielder's set is priced

Rare Skins: 900 V-Bucks for the skin, 300 for the Backbling

Epic Skins: 1100 V-Bucks for the Skin, 400 for the Backbling

Legendary Skins: 1500 V-Bucks for the Skin, 500 for the backbling

Older skins that didn't follow this model probably can't be broken up like this lest there be an outcry but they brought the reflex skin back so nothing is off the table.

These ""cheaper"" prices would definitely sway more people to buy V-Bucks, and more to complete it or vice versa, so I don't see why I would not be financially feasible.

If they do, they should really discount the price of the skin. If the back bling is going to be 200 vbucks, the akin ahould be diacounted at 600 vbucks.

We arguably have it worse than console in terms of performance right now. Here are some of the bugs:

1. The stuttering issues. Especially when jumping out of the battle bus or during a build fight. FPS is at a constant 150-200 then drops down to 30- 60 FPS.

2. Editing seems to be delayed again for some people. It was fine when the client side update first came out but it has turned back to the delay it seems.

3. This might be the most annoying one. The rendering issue needs to get fixed. Every other game it seems like I land and the map hasn't loaded in and everything looks like a giant blob. My character glitches into the ground for about a minute until everything is normal again. Of course by that time people looted everything and it is best that I just leave the game. It also occurs during the game when I am gliding in the air and a POI looks blurry or the thing I am running to looks blurry until I get close to it. 

4. Ping has been awful lately for NA East servers. Most people complaining about ping in the community are from NA East.

5. The loading screen to get into the pregame lobby takes longer lately? Question mark on that one because maybe that is meant to be in the game now.

6. There is a bug that makes a build have the edit option but it is not your build and you can't edit it obviously. This is quite frequent especially on creative maps and has gotten me eliminated multiple times because I try to edit a building and it won't work.

7. Multiple people have noticed that the .15 second build delay is back. Also goes back to the server side editing being back. Maybe this happened on accident and no one in Epic noticed or they just forgot to let us know in a previous update. Building does seem slower. 

8. Lots of ghost shots/guns shooting on accident lately  therefore giving up position.

9. People have been phasing through builds (I know this is an aspect of the game, but it has been happening more than usual lately). For example, I place a ramp or floor to trap my opponent but he ends up jumping through it. Bullets are also phasing though builds and shooting people through walls.

so he says everyday ""you suck at fortnite."" he's 9, so i understand he's immature, but it's a constant thing. so i've given him a solution to our quarrels. 

we play 5 games. same skin, pickaxe, emotes, same everything. we play solo (since that's what we're best at). we average our placement and whoevers average is the lowest wins bragging rights. everything is settled except one thing. we cant decide what to use to build. 

he claims he is a ""builder pro"" and uses builder pro all the time. i use combat pro. 

this is a problem because everything that can be controlled is taken care of, except the building mode.

I‚Äôm sure people have seen this and shared their own ideas as to it‚Äôs meaning, so I figured I‚Äôd take a more in depth look at what it could possibly bring to Fortnite in the future.

In ancient Aztec and Mayan beliefs, solar eclipses were signs of bad omens sent by the gods when the humans failed to please them.  Prolonged solar eclipses were believed to be signs of the apocalypse.

The recent addition of Sunny Steps is based off of Aztec architecture, and further confirmed by the name of the recently leaked Axetec pickaxe.  If the ‚ÄúThe End is Nigh‚Äù spray really is hinting towards an apocalyptic theme for season 9, then the most likely possibility for the lead up after the conflict between Ice King, Blackheart and the Prisoner is over will be some sort of solar eclipse that blocks out the sun and starts the apocalypse.

The minute you shoot at someone they throw up the Taj Mahal and Empire State.

What needs to be added to the game so it's not all about instant building and editing is 1 health point damage for every 10 materials that you farm, that way building has a risk to it rather than infinite invincibility. ",FortNiteBR

The combination of those two is devastating and I lost that game. I understand that such tactics are really good but like damn think about other players experience.

I think it will be a really cool thing to add in and it will make a lot of people happy because if you get a body shot you can switch and get a headshot and switch again and get another body shot and they will be dead, just like the good old days, It‚Äôs not op but that‚Äôs the point.

This would also help pubs because there won't be as many ""easy kills"" and every encounter feels like a balanced battle. Of course there will still be sweats but at least they won't be getting as many kills to satisfy their addiction.

Instead of just having one LTM available at any given moment, Epic could have a full suite of LTM's to choose from.  OR, instead of ""LTM""s we could just have a full playlist of many different modes - some being more competitive, some being more casual.

This would disperse a lot of the casuals throughout the other game modes and competitive players / ""Sweats"" could thrive in the main modes.

I am a competitive player but I also LOVE playing the LTM's.  I wish there were 1. More LTM's (or other permanent game modes) available at any given moment and 2. Solo/Duo/Squad available for all LTM's rather than just one of the three",FortNiteBR

I understand that Creative/Playground is a great way to practice building, but doing constant 90s, triple ramp rushes, cone jumps and building to the sky limit will *not* make you a better player.

What happens once you've gained high ground on someone by 2-3 stories? What's your next step? Once your opponent starts turtling, you'll need to drop down anyway to try and get the build replace(s) off turning the fight in to a near 50/50.

If someone starts overbuilding against me, I simply start breaking builds. There's no way I'm having a build battle high up in to the sky. That's just an invitation for a third party to come along, break down mine and my opponents builds and get two free kills. Once my opponent begins overbuilding, I simply break their builds. Better hope you have Glider Redeploy or a Launch Pad at the ready!

Watch SypherPK. He rarely builds high up against his opponents and spends a lot of time in boxes. His quick edits and shots enable him to regularly outplay his opponents, most of whom tend to be overbuilders.

Being able to build incredibly fast is not a definitive sign of skill. Being able to maintain a comfortable one story advantage over your opponent while being able to get your shots off as well as incorporating edits in to your fight and recognizing when you're probably building a bit too high up is much more effective than simply building without keeping track of your opponents.

Look for openings too. Is your opponent double ramping out from their turtle with the intention of doing a 180/90 to regain height? Are they double ramping in an open space without solidifying their stairs? Shooting out their bottom stair has the potential for their entire double ramp to be destroyed thus causing them to die from fall damage without requiring you to build up any higher. Fight over.

There's no shame in your opponent taking high ground from you. You're not going to gain height over your opponent *every single time* you engage in a fight. I get the impression that a lot of people think they're an awful builder if they can't consistently retake height. Regaining height over a good player is incredibly difficult once they have high ground. I'd rather be a well rounded player who can outplay opponents instead of a crazy fast builder that does nothing once they have height.",FortNiteBR

Adding SBMM will result in a complete sweat-fest for those at the top and will not allow for anyone to be able to play causal. A perfect matchmaking system will mean that you should have a 1kd with a 1%win rate. The problem with this is that even through improving and getting better you will not feel as though you have actually improved as you will be playing better players. This may not sound like a bad thing however this can be quite demoralising as grinding doesn‚Äôt feel rewarding. 

This where a ranked comes in it allows causal(or lower skilled) players a chance to play their skill and also allow ‚Äòsweats‚Äô to play their tier. However the main change is that there is a goal to grind and a purpose to playing higher skilled players. The main thing that stays the Same is the normal playlists as let‚Äôs be real here do you want to try hard or ‚Äòsweat‚Äô every game? Probably not the normal playlists allow for casual play and a way to prevent burn out. 

TLDR: SBMM is a shortcut that will create other problems

However, not only will ranked mode not be a concrete solution to the casual vs pro problem we have right now, it would actually give sweats more of an opportunity to dominate your asses.

Think about it; if sweats really are these kill thirsty players who only care about getting easy wins...what is stopping them from going into casual playlists as opposed to ranked playlists? Sure, you could solve this by making sure that the default playlists aren't available for try-hard's, but is that really the best solution? Taking the ability to play casually out of their hands, and instead just placing them into a permanent hell filled to the brim with TTV soccer skins?

The truth is, there isn't one solid route to fix this problem yet. What the community should be preaching for instead of a ranked playlist is skill-based matchmaking. This would continuously allow players to be in matches with other players that have a similar skill level (I'm sure you knew that), which would prevent players from losing to somebody completely out of their league.

Im sure this'll get downvoted to hell because I'm ""complaining about complaining"", but that's not the point im trying to get across here. I'm just trying to state that ranked isn't the only option to solve our current issues here (and it's certainly not the best one). Plus, Epic has tried making items in the past that would be useful tools for casuals to take down pro players, while at the same time not being too powerful to the point where they aren't able to be outplayed. Now did Epic succeed in that department with items such as the Stormwing and Infinity Blade? Well no, definitely not, but it was a step in the right direction (after all, you probably didn't see many people here complain about sweats while planes were out huh?).

I know I'll get downvoted to oblivion for having a different opinion than most of the sub, and I know I'll get called a karma fisher for posting something about a controversial topic, but that's okay. I'm just trying to start a civil discussion here about the problems with the game in it's current state, and you know what? I'm probably wrong about what I've said here! There may be merit to a ranked playlist after all, and perhaps introducing ""casual"" items isn't a great solution either.

All I ask from this community is to be kind, civil, and willing to listen while discussing these topics (admittedly something I could work on myself), because we'll reach a solution much quicker that way opposed to arguing on and on about what's right or wrong.",FortNiteBR

It's had some sort of link to A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones). If you're interested in Game of Thrones it might be interesting... Or a load of rubbish. 

Firstly, the ice part. There was an ice King like the Night King who wished to spread the snow throughout the map and had his monsters, they spawned to help him take over.

Secondly, the fire part. The prisoner. The only one who can beat the Ice King. He was born again through doing challenges. Where the final one was completed there is now a volcano and water. Part of the prophecy in GoT is ""born again amidst salt and smoke"" the smoke is the volcano and the salt is where the pirates are. 

Finally the 'dragon eggs' there were three like in GoT. Only thing missing is the 'mother of dragons'... Possibly that's who the Tier 100 skin is meant to be. With hidden variants that will come out when the big even happens. This even could also happen when the final season of GoT is released. They are all looking for some sort of treasure and it could be a mythic weapon in order to give them the strength to overcome the enemy.

I think there are definitely Easter eggs to A Song of Ice and Fire. Not sure if the theory holds up (probably not). Thanks anyway. ",FortNiteBR

I also should have no problem with my connection because I have good ISP and my internet can run multiple consoles and computers (all playing games and streaming movies/videos at the same time) with no problem.

 Last season when season seven first released, my game could barely run for 30 seconds without freezing up for minutes at a time, especially during gunfights, when landing from the battle bus, entering areas with buildings, or travelling quickly with vehicles or mobility items. The game would run like this off and on, switching every day or so for the next seven or eight weeks, with playable days coming fewer and farther apart as the season went on. It was so bad that I couldn't play the game despite wanting to, since it's the only game that I can play with my Xbox and Playstation friends (and I had a battle pass that I paid for that I wanted to complete).

 In the last two or three weeks of the season the game ran fine. I finished my challenges, (barely) completed my battle pass, got the prisoner styles, experienced the earthquakes, flew across the map with the driftboards (with no problems and no freezing whatsoever), and I was actually able to enjoy matches with my friends.

 Fast forward to the beginning of this season: everything's broken AGAIN, but this time it's EVEN WORSE.

 I can't take more than three steps without my game freezing up for three or four minutes, and if anyone shoots a gun within 100m of me the game decides that it's going to freeze until five minutes after I die! I can't play regular modes anymore, because if I don't die to someone landing on me, I die to the storm when someone nearby shoots their gun and my game freezes! I had to rely on Team Rumble to get my first week of challenges done, and even then I had to use squad share to get 5/7 of them, since all I could do was go to different locations and hope I didn't freeze in the air and get killed before I even had a chance to land.

 All I want is for this major, game-breaking issue to get fixed early enough in the season that I can keep playing with my friends and complete my challenges as they come out instead of having to put it off for five or six weeks.

TL:DR the game was freezing really bad last season, but Epic fixed it in the last couple weeks. Then they broke it again with the new season and it's worse than the first time. Epic, please, PLEASE fix!",FortNiteBR

Screw team rumble, screw close encounters, Leviathan is where it‚Äôs at.

The period of time that it was available was probably the best part of my entire fortnite experience. To those of y‚Äôall who never got the privilege of playing it, this mode basically consisted of a large creature like thing rising out of Moisty Mire (rip moisty) and moving towards a certain direction, one team would be in charge or protecting the creature, while the other team would try to kill (wait no I mean eliminate, don‚Äôt sue me Vox, fortnite isn‚Äôt a violent game) the creature before it reaches its target. It was super fun and I bet all the season 3-4 players can agree

So yeah, please Epic, if you wanna know how to get your audience and players back, this is how.

And before anyone comments, yeah i know you can swap out guns but what if you want the other gun back? Do you camp it out so no one snatches it or waste your time camping drops all game with the chance of getting the gun.

...and yet there's more to it than this even. The game just doesn't feel fun anymore, and the suspense that came in the form of in-game events and a loose storyline now feels particularly uncared for. The only part I enjoy of this season is the arrival of Blackheart; we got zero explanation or look at how the island transformed (which makes no sense considering that the rifts were responsible for the large transformation last time. Blackheart arrived on a rowboat, so how did that lagoon get there? and the aztec area?). It just feels like Epic Games is plodding through this season at the start of it all and I can't fathom why. The game just doesn't feel like the Fortnite that kept me engaged through seasons 4, 5, 6, and 7.

having said all of that, I do like the new locations, the various new mechanics (not enough. Cannons are cool but very circumstantially useful; I like geysers), etc. I just wish the game would run optimally without all the bugs, not to mention we need a solution to the ridiculous skill gap.

This is just toxic behavior. So, I wanted to lay out every popular idea for the game and both sides.

Skill Based Match Making~

Side 1: People who want it

The consensus is that the game is unforgiving to casual players who just want to have fun. They don‚Äôt want the game to just be grinding where they practice in playground and creative for hours just for a burst of fun. They want the burst to last for the ten- twenty minute matches of Fortnite.

Side 2: Why it‚Äôs not ideal

Fortnite is a game where you need to practice. You earn wins, not just getting them by chance. The game is about hard work and the amount of time you put in is just dedication. Playing to improve is to help in the long term.

Skins In Fortnite That Are Returning

Side 1: It‚Äôs just a skin

These are in-game cosmetics. OG skins like Recon Expert should get re-released for the people that want it. It makes sense from a standpoint where you want money and for most players to be happy they get an ‚ÄúOG‚Äù skin. People are also getting rewarded because they bought a skin. They get premium styles by chance and not by work.

Side 2: It‚Äôs a status symbol

OG skins should not be returned because the status they possess gets ruined. They are rare and that‚Äôs that. I earned purple skull trooper by buying him when Fortnite was new, showing how much of a fan I am. Skins like Nog-Ops and Red Knight are ruined. I also spent hundreds of dollars just for a skin I should be the only owner of to get released.

Planes Were Okay~

Side 1: Planes were balanced/just needed a bit of tweaking

Planes were extremely useful and I still find myself getting used to the fact that they‚Äôre gone. They were a lifesaver and just needed to get balanced by (so and so). They‚Äôre essential to playing.

Side 2:  Planes desentivise building and ruin the game.

Planes destroy buildings and kill hard working players with their OP guns. Players who use them aren‚Äôt skilled and 3rd party. They completely added a third mechanic to the game of looking out overhead.

Players Of This Game Are Greedy And Want Everything, Ruining The Sub~

Side 1: They are giving out constructive criticism on why we need things 

How would Epic know what‚Äôs best for the game without the fandom‚Äôs opinion? If we don‚Äôt speak out about problems, nobody will know. We need back rifts and need skill-based matchmaking so the game can be much more fun.

Side 2: Y‚Äôall need to stop complaining.

Epic made this game the way it is. You are all acting like children. They know what‚Äôs best/balanced and have never once made a bad decision. You should be grateful.

Those were some of the biggest ones and I‚Äôll add more. From now on though, please stop arguing with each other. Day after day some of the posts that are receiving awards are just hating on people who they disagree with. I know this post is a bit hypocritical since I‚Äôm about to say this, but people who just fight others on this sub make it horrible and unbearable. Stop making it toxic and unfun. You‚Äôre not doing anything productive, you‚Äôre just karma-farming by regurgitating the same opinion. ",FortNiteBR

Yeah, it's fine. Keep in TR for months and months. Driftin' mode comes out for the first time, TR gets removed, for like a day or 2. People cry on Reddit ""OmG wHy ReMoVe TeAm RuMbLe, BrInG iT BaCk"" and guess what? Ofc, they bring it back. And of course, they always cater the respawn modes. Always.

People want to enjoy other Large Team modes too that's non-respawn. Not everything ALWAYS have to cater Team Rumble.. It's really frustrating and unfair, imo. That's like pretty much all the Large Team mode we had for the past months. 

Gliding behind people, suiciding bombing yourself gets old quick. Good luck, getting your seasonal umbrella. Would be nice to hear a word from Epic, knowing them, won't hear jack about it.

1,pugwalker,1521668055,8662kw,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8662kw/pump_shotgun_omitted_variable_bias/,30,Pump shotgun omitted variable bias,"I've been seeing a lot of whining about the pump shotgun needing to be nerfed but I think people are forgetting a crucial aspect of why many feel the pump shotgun is overpowered. 

It's pretty clear that it takes a certain amount of skill to use a pump shotgun effectively which is why most inexperienced players run the tactical shotgun to start out.  This creates a weird dynamic where being a good player is associated with running a pump over a tactical shotgun.

What basically ends up happening is that people who chose to run tactical shotguns because it is easier to use end up losing more fights to players running pump shotguns.  They then jump to the conclusion that the pump shotgun is overpowered without considering that it might not be the pump shotgun but the players who run pumps being better than those who run tac.  **This is very clear omitted variable bias because it assumes the pump shotgun, rather than the skill of the player, is what won the fight.**

The pump allows you take more of an advantage from building and positioning which is why they are better in the hands of good players.  There is no reason to nerf this so that worse players can beat better players more often in shotgun fights.  Nerfing the pump to go toe to toe with the tac just lowers the skill ceiling overall which is bad for the game.  

TLDR: Pumps are associated with being better so pump players kill tac players more often, creating the misconception that the pump is massively overpowered. ",FortNiteBR

You get Destiny 2, a game dead within months of its release because every weapon sucked donkey balls.

Pump shotguns are not OP. Tac shotties if anything need a buff. If you die to someone rather than blame the game, blame yourself for not building or aiming well enough to down the person before they can blast you in the face. FortNite is so successful because of high paced gameplay, remove or nerf drop rates for shotties and it would be a horrendous campfest with people sat in bushes, on hills or in built towers. As the game is, all of those are perfectly viable options as a playstyle, just like being an aggressive builder/shotgun warrior is a viable playstyle. ",FortNiteBR

So why is Ninja claiming the record with 21 wins?  If he wasn't so big (currently 100,000 people watching him on Twitch) it wouldn't matter, but he shouldn't claim that if it's not true.  What's up with this?

Obviously you can’t place it when downed but I think it’s fair to be able to detonate ones you’ve already placed when downed.

I am a data analyst IRL and after seeing quite some post with titles like: ""Finally my first win after x games"" and ""I already played x games and still haven't won, am I a noob"", I wanted to see whether these people are just unlucky with their wins, are actually just bad at the game or that is statistically plausible that is just how the game works. 

To check this I will be looking at the average win% and the change of not winning a game for a long streak of games. And as we are not all the same people, I will check this for 6 hypothetical type of players.
 
First of all: the average fortnite player. When 100 people get dropped in a map and only one is victorious, our average player has a winrate of 1%. Normal distribution tells us that most players will be around this winrate, and as I do not have the exact data I will assume ""better than average"" to be at 1.5% winrate en ""worse than average"" at 0.5% winrate. The last 3 cases will be some extreme cases: a really good player at 5%, the Myths/Ninjas of the world at 30% winrate. The last case will be myself: at 0.3% winrate (actual s3 data), with a k/d of almost 0.89 (of which the implacation I might research in another post if this one gets anough traction).

Let's just jump into the actual data:

Disclaimer: This only works for Solo's. Furthermore this is purely hypothetical as A. You need to play a lot of games to know your actual winrate (f.e. if I (at 1 win in 300 games) would win my next 2 games, I would move up from 0.3% to 1% which has serious impact as we will see below) and B. Ones strength might change over time due to learning the game and becoming better compared to the competition.


Player|Winrate|10|50|100|250|500
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Myth/ninja|30%|2,8%|0,0%|0,0%|0,0%|0,0%
Fortnite Hero|5%|59,9%|7,7%|0,6%|0,0%|0,0%
Above avg|1,50%|86,0%|47,0%|22,1%|2,3%|0,1%
Average|1%|90,4%|60,5%|36,6%|8,1%|0,7%
Below avg|0,50%|95,1%|77,8%|60,6%|28,6%|8,2%
Pieke89|0,30%|97,0%|86,1%|74,0%|47,2%|22,3%


So this shows us that an average player has a 36.6% chance to not win a single game is they play 100 games in a row. It also shows that a ""below"" average player has a fair chance (8.2%) of not winning a game for 500 games in a row! And that for people that are lower skilled than that have a decent shot of not winning a game in the next couple hundred games. 

Conclusion: To go back to the actual reason behind this post. The people that have their first win after a couple of hundred (or even more) games: No you are not bad, statistically you could just be a completely average Fortnite Player

However a post announcing this had some pretty rediculous comments from some people. 

People on this sub jusy want to make the game easier for themselves. They displayed that when they said “Blitz should be permanent because it has way more mats and loot”. No, if you want mats and better loot, you farm kills and trees for a while etc, not just get given 100 by one tree or camp in a bush and get a gold scar.

If you don’t like shotgun battles, don’t get close! It’s really that simple unless you bump into someone or it’s a small circle. Any good player will realise they have to stop complaining and blaming the game and just adapt. Getting rekt by shotguns? Build higher and shotgun them back or avoid them in the first place. Getting sniped too often? Build and make unpredictable movements running across flat areas or don’t peek.

Coming back to when I said they want to make the game easier, it’s most likely because they are not good. You don’t see any of the top players in the community complaining about shotguns? And the game should be based around the highest level of play. Therefore, if it’s balanced at high level, it’s automatically balanced at any other level of play (many games follow this rule of thumb).

Another thing you guys forget is shotguns are meant to be bread and butter at close range, just like the scar at medium/long. 

Instead of calling for nerfs, how about we call for buffs of other weapons to counter it. Overwatch is a good display of this.

That is all.

Now I’m not saying pump shotguns should be taken out of the game, but I do think their rarity and probability of spawning should be changed for a more balanced experience. Other weapons in the game that can kill people in one shot such as rocket launchers and snipers are blue rarity or higher with lower spawn rates because they are higher powered weapons. The pump shotguns have the power to drop someone in one shot so it would only make sense that they should be just as rare as the other higher powered weapons.

This is just my opinion on the matter. Let me know what you all think. 

TL;DR: Pump shotties should be changed from their current rarity for better balancing. 

Edit: Not whining. I use a common pump over every other shotgun because it’s that powerful. I just think they shouldn’t be this common because of the power they have. ",FortNiteBR

I've contacted my bank and have gotten a new card but they can't refund it unless Epic Games does something. I've sent a support ticket and am hoping for a reply but after some searches it doesn't seem like lots of people get this refunded. I am unable to pay upcoming bills/rent without the refund so I am posting to reddit to hopefully get some more attention from Epic.

I would urge you to check your emails on this site; https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and make sure your account is secure by having two step verification, or just re-add your card info everytime you are looking to buy v-bucks.

Note; I've never tried signing up for free v-bucks or anything of the sort. I think I've just used the same password email combo too many times and at some point it was leaked in some data breach. 


edit; I got some emails confirming a refund (still waiting for it to process through the banks) and a password reset about 15 minutes ago, thanks Epic and another reminder you can't be too safe online.

I ended up created an excel file with all of the daily challenges, weekly challenges, and leveling up rewards to try and solve this problem. According to my spreadsheet, if you do everysingle daily and weekly challenge, you can reach tier 100 and only be level 37. This seems way low to me, so feel free to correct me!

Weekly Challenges (9 weeks) = 450 crowns,                                
Non-Battle pass challenges = 100 crowns,                       
Daily Challenges (68 days) 68x5 = 340,                           
Leveling up rewards to level 37 = 110,                     
Total = 1000,                    
Crowns needed for tier 100 = 1000

Edit: With 10 weekly challenges that level requirement drops the whole way to level 20.

He said they were a pain and basically only came to the library to torment and provoke him, but I was determined to change things. When I first came in contact with the disruptive students (mostly 7th graders) I noticed that they talked alot about Fortnite. So I started chatting with them about it, and they were slightly in disbelief that I played games. I'm 29, but I guess I look ancient in their eyes. They invited me to play with them and I took them up on it.

I'm so bad at the game, good at other genres but they're so incredibly quick at building stuff. My aim is pretty good but I'm always at a disadvantage because I try to avoid building as far as I can. They think it's hilarious to play with me though, and as a result they've started behaving better in the library. I guess it's not as fun to be provocative as it is to play games with the librarian.

This story doesn't really have a point other than that Fortnite has helped me connect with a bunch of disruptive students. It's not my favorite game to play, but it's actually tangibly improved my work situation and that's awesome.",FortNiteBR

My squad is called ""The gucci gang"" cause a buddy of ours started calling us the ""420gucciGaNgyoLOFORTNiTESquAD"" as kind of a joke and it stuck. We're now the gucci gang and its fantastic. 


I'm CDawg and im a frontliner. Usually when there's a fight im either on the ar or the shotgun but I can hold my own with just about any weapon :) 

Finn: Finn and I started to play Fortnite together. Honestly I think this is our first experience of a 3rd person shooter and we both have a cod background. Finn says he's a support guy. I think he doesnt take into note of how many times ive looked next to me and he's right there in the frontlines. Finn's a planner. He's gotten me many of wins by making sure I slow down and think things out first. Dude is pretty damn good with a shotgun too

JerBear: JerBear is a rusher. He's got a helllllll of a long distance shot with an ar. Hands down he may be one of the best distance shooters ive ever seen. Boy hates the sniper tho lol makes me laugh. Me and jer are currently tied with the highest kill game with 11 (not epic but pretty cool for us)

Rchet: Rchet is the newest to our squad and he's the sniper. He's been sniping from wayyyyy back in his cod days and its carried over. He's also our only pc player so know that the cross platform is real with us. I count on his snipes and I appreciate them so much when im in 4 deep with a pump that only does 9 damage to the face

This is my gucci gang. This is my fortnite squad. We're just a group of grown ass adults who have gotten together to chill, play video games, and get away from the ""too much-ness"" that is life. I couldn't imagine my life without these boyyos now and I def couldnt imagine a better squad to play fortnite battle royal with.

Find a way to keep some clips of your games, guys. One day you're going to want to look back and see how much fun you had with your friends.


With this post I wanted to give a little shout out to an old friend of mine.... He used to be my sniper teammate back in call of duty black 2 and some of bo3.

Hey Reddit! I believe we should have a “Lifetime” or “Career” challenges section, that is available to everyone and likewise, the same for everyone. These challenges would ideally be long, but not necessarily hard. 

For example, one might find themselves with a challenge of “Play 150 games as Jonesy.” We know that starting the game without a skin equipped gives you a random one, Jonesy being the blond “poster child” of Fortnite. Completing this challenge would unlock an Uncommon rarity skin of a modified Jonesy - perhaps he now has a beard and battle scars?  This idea could even be expanded on. Completing 300 games as Jonesy could unlock a more modified, yet unlockable and free, skin anyone could use if they’ve put in the hours/have the experience.

The same idea can be applied to weapon skins. “Get 50 headshots with a Pump Shotgun,” for example, could give us a shotgun with a light-colored wooden stock and a silver barrel. Of course, that’s just one of the many possibilities; Epic could implement it in a tier form, as well. 50 headshots nets you the silver-barreled, 100 headshots gives you another variant, 150 headshots gives yet another. 

Why do I feel as though it should be unlockable? Currently, I feel like once you’ve completed the weekly challenges, you don’t have anything else to work forward for a week. Yes, you have winning, the ultimate goal, but to me and presumably others, having a backlog of things to accomplish greatly improves motivation to play. 

In my opinion, the pros of this includes giving free members something to work forward (perhaps inspiring them to buy a battle pass), as well as adding in much-desired unlockable weapon skins that show you didn’t shell out $20 for, no sir, you worked your ass off for 150 headshots. It also expands the amount of skins we could have in the game and give free players an alternative they can grind for. This also, as mentioned above, gives the game more depth besides weekly challenges and the hunt to win.

This caused the use of the scoped AR to increase for about to week. Personally, i believe the scoped AR needed a damage buff where head shots do 50 damage instead of 48, and body shots doing 25 instead of 24. The gun takes 5 body shots or 3 head shots to down a full HP opponent. This becomes 10 body shots or 5 head shots for someone who is fully shielded. 5 head shots are quite rare to land consecutively, especially for FPS noobs, and also because of the building mechanic. Many players have already adapted to building walls the second a shot hits or comes near them. A damage buff of 1 to the body and 2 to the head will reduce the amount of hits it takes to down an opponent. This will Reduce the shots needed to take down a 100 HP opponent to 4 instead of 5 and 2 to the head, instead of 3. Of course this will also reduce the amount of shots it will take to defeat a full HP and full shield opponent to 4 head shots or 8 body shots.",FortNiteBR

**Previous reasons to why this hasn’t been added yet and why they are no longer (or never really have been) an issue:**




1) **R3/Right stick to be crouch while building which would move the rotate button.** Now that you guys implemented crouch while building without using the R3/Right stick button **this is no longer an issue.**


2)  **Unsure which button should be bound to which structure.** It is perfect how it is in the picture:

a. RT/R2 for wall: that what is is anyway when you open building if you have 'reset building choice' enabled

b. LB/L1 for roof: that what is is to get to it anyway after you open building if you have 'reset building choice' enabled

c. RB/R1 for floor: that what is to get to it anyway after you open building if you have 'reset building choice' enabled

d. LT/L2 for stairs: this would be the only one different then how it is now


Although these are the ones that make the most sense, it doesn’t really matter in the end because we will get used to it. **Therefore no issue.**




3)  **Y/Triangle wanted to be quick access to the pickaxe.** I completely disagree with this on so many levels. B/Circle is already exit build mode so triangle for changing materials makes perfect sense. There is no NEED for quick access to the harvesting axe. It is just a preference. Almost all would take this controller scheme over quickly switching to pickaxe. And if you don't want to give that up: you do not have to use this scheme! It would be a travesty if this controller scheme wasn’t added just because you guys wanted quick access to the harvesting tool! **This is no issue.**




The ONLY possible reasons I could see to why this isn't in the game is that it is not ready yet, there are issues with each button being both a 'select' and a 'place' command, or an issue with this controller scheme and the new turbo building.




I would love to see an epic response to this and given an updated reason why if this won't be coming to the game soon.


On a final note: if you want this new controller scheme as much as I do please upvote and comment for more visibility in hopes someone from epic reads this.",FortNiteBR

I mean seriously! Can we please get a ban or a major nerf on rockets. I swear it's the main reason I lose games now-a-days get into the top 10 or better, 3-10 kills already, and lose because some dude is spamming rockets at close range. 

I mean there is no skill involved with them at all!

Sniper duel = skill. 
Mid-long range aim duel = skill. 
Close range, frantic shotgun duel = skill. 
Build off = skill. 
Point and clicky, one shot inta kill with full shields even though it landed 3 tiles away
... = No skill. 

It's not like we even need then to destroy buildings anymore. Miniguns and grenade launchers are just as good. All rockets do now is ruin the game for anyone who wasn't favoured enough by RNGesus to pick one up. 

Can't we please just remove them until they are balanced already? I feel they just don't fit the game anymore.

If you've played the game long enough, you know that hearing that dink sound of a headshot when using a burst is oh so gratifying. However, I've lately been concerned about just how much damage the burst has the potential to do. There are times when I'm using the thing and I am just blown away when I see the amount of damage I've done. To me the gun just seems to arbitrarily give ridiculous amounts of damage at times. Please don't grab your pitchforks. I just want to hear some thoughts on the matter.

I'll leave a link below from moments ago that illustrates my concerns. I did not end up dying to this guy, but you'll notice a whopping 130hp come off of me from one shot. At the beginning of the clip you can hear a sniper shot miss me. So, we have the long range weapon doing a max of what 110hp or so which misses. Yet, a player can immediately switch to the burst and deliver 130 hp. And yes I'm aware that it can deliver even more damage... To me this is extreme considering the distance. Thoughts?

Each named zone should have a trait, or stationery ability that can spawn there.  Similar to a chest spawn rate.  Half the time the zone gets the ability, half the time it doesnt.

Here are some random ideas to give you a better idea...

1.  Flush Factory should have a machine that spits out 100 metal every 60 seconds.  Obviously, if no one claims the metal, it can pile up to 999 metal 10 minutes into the game.

2.  Pleasant Park should have a hospital with a machine inside that spits out 1 med kit every two minutes until it reaches 3 med kits max.

3.  Moisty Mire should have a magic tree that heals everyone within a large radius (I'm talking half the size if the swamp or bigger) with an additional 1hp per second.  Destroy the tree, destroy the effect.

4.  Tilted Towers should have a radar pulse beacon that gains one charge every 2 minutes.  You walk up to this terminal, hit a button, and it sends a pulse over Tilted Towers that takes a 5 second snapshot of all the enemies within range on your map and mini map.  They pop up as red arrows and fade away after 5 seconds.

And so on and so forth. 

I think this would give the map a ton more flavor and would allow players to make more meaninful choices while running towards next circle.  Plus, it would give players more interesting stories to tell.

•Bug with building took almost 2 weeks to fix in console, it got reverted back to its previous state.

•Console players have asked for better button layout and customization to controls and building order for months and haven't heard of it.

•People keep posting of lag, stuttering, and freeze in console and none of those post gets a reply from Epic (from what I be seen)

All other posts get reply; we just want to know if this are getting a potential fix.

But I will focus on a match I played yesterday which I can't get out of my mind.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was on Top 5 and I found an enemy. it was 1 vs 1 situation. I had a purple Scar and with my first few shots I did 1 headshot &amp; 1 normal shot. So I took his shield down. Until this time he didn't even hit me. He was just building walls in order to protect himself . Then surprisely with low hp and without shield he decided to rush me.

&amp;nbsp;

I was pretty sure it was an easy kill, he was low and I was almost full. So while he was really close to me I took out my Tac shotgun and I aim right on head. I heared the nice headshot sound (like Super Mario coins) and I see freaking 20 DMG. and guess what? He shot me with 2 lucky headshots in a row.

&amp;nbsp;

He was completed noob. I totally outplayed this guy and it was so easy kill.

&amp;nbsp;

Why I'm telling you all these??

&amp;nbsp;

This is what I call a totally UNFAIR game.I knew that Fortnite is based on Luck and not the skills but that was the biggest proof to me. He killed me just because the system decided to give him 2 freaking headshots in a row with full dmg while system decided to give me a freaking 20 DMG headshot.

&amp;nbsp;

I have doubt even if he was aiming on my head or just the spay of his shots decided to go right on my head.
&amp;nbsp;

So do you call this a fair game? Are the planning to make this game an Esport game?

&amp;nbsp;

Too bad I don't have the video in order to show everyone how unfair the game is right now and that 80% based on luck and 20% on skill.

&amp;nbsp;

When I first begun posting on Facebook, reddit and forum about bloom and Random dmg on Shotguns, there were many people keep saying the same stupid thing.

&amp;nbsp;

""Aim better, learn to build fast and outplay your enemies""

&amp;nbsp;

So my question to EPIC team and all those defenders of the Bloom system.

&amp;nbsp;

What do you mean aim better ? while I aim right on the head and I do a freaking 7-20 dmg headhsots instead of 100+ dmg, I will not even talk about AR &amp; Deagle accurancy...(That's a whole new thread) and how exactly can outplay my enemies when they have luck with their own side and their shotguns headshots do more dmg than mine or their AR spray hit double headshot while mine goes everywhere except their body or head.

&amp;nbsp;

No matter how good you are, the Bloom is a thing that shouldn't be exists and the shotguns dmg shouldn't be so random, especially when you hit head!!!

&amp;nbsp;

There is not other Shooting game in the WORLD that has Bloom, I just don't get it why they don't fix it. Where is Shooting Test 2? Does EPIC prefer to reward luck instead of Skill?

&amp;nbsp;

Epic prefer to bring new LTMs instead of bring Shooting Test 2. And yes we are talking about a TEST. What exactly they are waiting for?

&amp;nbsp;

Last season I had 1.20% win ratio, I was bad. My brain couldn't accept the fact that I was aiming right on enemy and bullets was going right and left. Every time I was like ""This is an easy kill, I got it"" that mistake had as a result to lose most of the 1 vs 1 fights.Thanks Bloom for this..!!!

&amp;nbsp;

On Season 3, I am averaging 2-3 wins per day and 6-10 kills per game. My win ratio jump to 5-6% but still that doesn't change the fact that BLOOM shouldn't be exists.

&amp;nbsp;

I will never stop hate and believe that Bloom shouldn't be exists or that shotguns random dmg shouldn't be happening. Even if I catch the 10-20% win ratio I will keep saying the same.
&amp;nbsp;
After all, All I have to say is this: ""Fortnite Battle Royale = Battle of Luck!""

&amp;nbsp;

First FIX the Shooting system and then do whatever you want. Add jetpacks, 10 different grenades, airplanes, boats, 100 new guns, potions, 10 new LTMs, make Fortnite Available on Nokia 3330 or do whatever you want!

&amp;nbsp;

BUT first fix the freaking SHOOTING SYSTEM! It's bad , REALLY BAD!!!!

&amp;nbsp;

P.S. 1) Sorry for the english, 2) yes, I'm mad with the shooting system 3) I love this game but Shooting system need to be fixed and yes I'm angry because they work on 100's other stuff expect shooting system, not even a single announcement about it.",FortNiteBR

On a side note, isn't this a dangerous policy if it is 120 minute lockout? I see how they want to protect accounts, but i would imagine trolls could just find somebodys email (like a popular streamer) and just lock them out for 2 hours at a time.",FortNiteBR

First off, lets start with an idea of what this would look like, shown [here](https://imgur.com/a/kJlwD). This is just an idea, its up to the epic devs to decide where they put it if it is implemented. It would be just like the pickaxe where you can select it with Triangle (Ps4), Y (Xbox One), or your keybind for pc, just a different button (I suggest one of the left or right arrows on the D pad) and once selected you can go back to items using the bumper, or keybind. 

#Why should it be implemented?

As of right now, grenades, c4, and impulse grenades are all usually going to be left behind after looting for anything better, which is most items you can find. Sacrificing one of your five slots for something simply isn't worth it to most people. They're not guns and they're not healing. They're essentially just extra items that you likely won't need, just like traps. However unlike traps and other items you collect in that slot, you will only be able to carry one type of grenade at a time. This allows for us to carry them without giving up anything that we actually NEED. This doesn't the game easier in anyway, it just makes it so the grenades aren't as useless.

#""Well if you just want more slots for more things, why not make healing ones too? You just want more space!""

No, You need healing and guns, which are the two remaining things. As more and more items are getting added we have less things we can pick up. Grenades reduce this further. This way we can pick up everything we do need, and have room for extra tid bits we could use as extras.

EDIT: Additional information

She was datamined a while ago, as we all know. When she was datamined, she was registered in Storm Shield as being of Epic rarity (costing 1500 Vbucks). However, when Drake and Ninja duos happened, Epic announced the Party Royale event and saw an opportunity to use her as the primary skin to release with it. They ended up changing the rarity of the skin to Legendary as well (costing 2000 Vbucks). You can see that at the Storm Shield website. So Epic was probably gonna release her soon but held on because of the event they announced.

KEEP IN MIND THAT IT'S NOT CERTAIN. She may end up releasing soon and I might look like a dumbass. I'm just saying it's unlikely that it will happen.",FortNiteBR

I take down three people in a fucking row till its just me and some other guy left, I keep moving, hide out in a house for about 29 seconds to listen for footsteps, move outside, I swear I hear gunshots coming from behind me, turn around, oh wait, it's some dude who's just decided to hole themselves up in their shitey wee brick tower instead of coming to face me like a man. Get shot from behind as I turn around,  instead of building like I normally would in any other situation, I try and shoot the guy with a shotgun. I had a rocket launcher, which I could have blown the base of the tower to smithereens with, I had plenty of wood to give myself some cover, I had a semi auto sniper, but what do I use? A fucking tactical shotgun.  

Towers might be the best way to get wins, but I feel there's just no honour in hiding from your opponents in a tower and shooting them while you conveniently have zone and then doing the L dance afterwards as if to say, ""yeah, look at how much of a loser you are and how skilled I am compared to you.""

 And yes, I know I'm salty, and yes, it is a legitimate tactic, but as silly as it may sound, I do care about honour and respect for your opponents in games like these, and sometimes I just can't stand losing at this game, it's irritating to put so much effort into collecting good weapons, getting kills, watching yourself slowly improve and then wasting it all away when the rush of adrenaline from being in second place puts you off. But, ah well, it is just a game, maybe one day I'll get my win. GG whoever killed me. Anyone got any advice as to how they cope with the pressure of being in the final 1v1?

Pump:
-High damage
-Jump and pump
-1 shot at 200hp capable
-Easy to hit the haymaker and swap to your second secondary
-Very little/ if any follow up aim required
-You’re a try hard...

Tactical:
-Still high damage
-Still jump and pump
-you are a little worse at aiming maybe
-best pump secondary
-When reloading it takes .157 seconds longer to shoot as you chamber rounds, basically not even effecting its usefulness while reloading (any non shotgun is 100% useless while reloading)
-still takes little follow up aim
-one shot capable
-you’re still a try hard but I get it you have no choice, shotguns everywhere

Yes, both shotguns occasionally hit for 7-9 damage, but if it really effected its effectiveness you wouldn’t use it. 

To summarize, shotguns are the biggest crutch in the current meta. Everyone runs them because it’d be foolish not too. This really does put a damper on diversity and skill. You’re seeking to take out the opponent as easily as possible, which again is understandable. I just crave an honorable death or KILL YEA I USE EM TOO, I am coming at this from both stand points. Have gotten many unjust kills on the enemy cause the opness 

I honestly don’t know what game you are playing if you aren’t dying to a shotgun 90% of the time and at least 50% of those aren’t just some bull and not getting out played. 

Non of this is about building. I’m a 6/10 builder at best and put up my best fight (which console building is A LOT HARDER PC PLAYERS, try a controller for yourself and tell me I’m wrong) but rarely get into intense build battles. Please don’t combat all of these points with “should’ve built” cause it’s not always that simple when you get one shotted before you have a chance. And thanks for doing it anyway. 

So, if anyone has any *actually thought out and good* objections to why shotguns are not OP, I’d love to hear them and have a not heated, not internet troll, not rust lord debate. Intellectual debate about the current meta which I’ve deemed “Jump N Pump”. ",FortNiteBR

I think I'm correct if i say that i'm not the only who is getting sick/tired of Fortnite. The bloom is getting out of hand. I'm sick of it, I'm done with it and it makes me want to stop playing Fortnite Battle Royale. It is so freaking annoying.

Shotguns close range low damage, bullets going to mars and beyond, rockets not doing damage(this is not bloom).

I switched over from CS:GO to Fortnite since it felt refreshing. As someone who is used to shooting mechanics that can be learnt or atleast that requires some skill to get used to, it was great playing CS:GO. Note : I think i'm (or was...) far above average in CS.

With Epic announcing Competitive play we surely need some skill. It is basicly RNG at the moment. You cannot make a competitve game with RNG in the most import mechanic. Whenever you shoot with the burst AR you must hope one hits atleast.

I'm mad and want to get this of my chest. I feel like if it doesn't change in a couple of updates the game is going to die off. Maybe not in a month, maybe not in half a year but it will go down. Player base will drop. We only had one shooting test, it was great and we need more of it.

I’m sure a lot of people know this but never do this. In my opinion the ideal base is 3 vertical walls high and the third floor has a roof and a floor. SO MANY people still have no roof and use stairs as the floor. The most common approach people have to this base is either to knock down the supporting walls or to build up to you and drop down on you. But if you have four walls and a roof this strategy is greatly weakened as they will not be able to rush you because they must break the roof. And if you hear them building you can even edit the floor and hide under it or pull out a shotgun and wait for them to follow you down.

## 1. Introduction  
    
---  

Coming out on top of a hundred players is no easy feat. You will have to battle your way through a torn apart battlefield and build your way up to that Victory Royale screen. There is, however, something you can do to improve your chances and that is reading and applying this guide. I have written it with the very intention of you getting your win rate up (or even your first win) and getting the most out of your games. This guide is of a very detailed nature and will hopefully help improve the game of those who read it.   
Before starting, I would like to make clear that this guide is particularly aimed at those players that struggle with getting wins and the tips and tricks I detail are focused on the goal of helping them win. It does still contain, however, a lot of good information for players that already win on a consistent basis.  
This is not a guide of the very basics, instead, it assumes that its readers have already played some games and are familiar with the fundamentals.      
As this guide is over 40 thousand characters, I will use two comments to complete it. If this is not allowed, just let me know as I am new to Reddit and this is my first post ever.    
This guide is original and written by me specifically for the benefit of players in this subreddit. Feel free to scroll down and jump to specific parts of the text if you don't want to read the whole of it.  
Feel free to comment and criticise this guide down below, I will try to update it regularly with the help of your best comments.

## 2. Dropping and landing  

---
### 2.1 Where to drop  

Before dropping from the battle bus, you should know where you are going. Nothing screams bad early game as loud as dropping from the bus and looking for a place to land while on the air. The best strategy to land in a good spot and start the game with some decent items is to have a mental list of comfortable landing places. The choice of these places is up to you, but if you want to get consistent you must stick to these. You want to have approximately four landing spots, preferably far from one another (to account for the bus's ever changing path) and get to know them as well as you know yourself. Having too many landing spots will make being comfortable in them more difficult. As I already mentioned, you can pick any spot you like as a comfort landing spot but I would like to share some thoughts on some of the best areas of the map as comfort landing spots, in my opinion.
 
**Anarchy Acres and Fatal Fields**      
Both these areas are perfect comfort landing spots. The amount of players that drop here normally does not exceed three or four (depending on the bus trajectory)and once you finish gathering gear and materials in these areas, you are usually well equipped to head into the mid-game. Personally, these are my personal comfort landing spots, and I prefer Fatal over Anarchy because it lets me farm more wood and is closer to more places.

**Pleasant Park**  

Pleasant is usually a bit busier than the farms but if you get to know it and rotate around it comfortably, it can be a great landing spot. There is tons of loot for you to get and is not too far from the middle of the map, which makes getting into the first circle easier.

**Greasy Groove**     

This is an underrated landing spot as there is a lot of collectable loot with relatively little risk as not much players use to drop there. I would definitely recommend it as one of your comfort landing zones.

**Retail Row**  
Retail Row is a common landing spot, but don't let that frighten you, if you feel that you have already learned how to handle early game, dropping in Retail Row will allow you to gather up a significant amount of loot and be in a center position in the map, which will make the storm move in your favour.
  
**Unmarked landing spots**  
These are the most underrated landing spots in the game. There is usually more loot in marked places (such as the ones mentioned above), but only because they tend to be bigger. There are, however, many unnamed places that make perfect landing zones. For example, the factory between Shifty Shafts and the Flush Factory is usually empty of players and has enough pallets to make you walk out with 800 wood and enough chests to give you full shields and decent weapons.   
  
These, however, are only examples and it is up to you to find the areas you are more confident landing in.
### 2.2 Dropping fast    
Once you get your comfort landing places down, you should aim to drop fast. Having comfort landing spots will help you know when to start dropping and when to open your glider. You should wait until the very last moment to open it, in order to land faster and beat other players to the first weapon. If you can, just drop and wait for the glider to deploy automatically. The best piece of advice that I can give to land faster is to take into account the terrain below you. If there is a mountain underneath you, your glider will auto deploy faster that if there was a valley below. Think about this when dropping. You should not blindly just wait for the glider to autodeploy in all situations. If your landing spot is a bit far off, you should deploy your glider and let it get you on top of your preferred building in order to get to the first chest without any delay.  
Another tip is knowing where to land inside your landing spot, that means that you should have a couple of go-to building where you know you can get your hands on a chest or weapon and be ready to fight any closeby players. This leads us to our next point, spotting players.   

### 2.3 Spotting other players   
It is very important to watch out for other players dropping in the same area than you. You should map how much players will land near you and in what exact house or building they drop. Once you have this information, your first movements will be much more safe and confident. Before jumping into the next point, we shall address what to do if someone lands at the same house or building that you do. If you can't avoid it, you will be stuck with another player on a roof. What you want to do is try to beat the other player to the first weapon or chest and start blasting bullets at him. This, however, might prove more a feat of luck than of skill. That is why I do not recommend landing in the same house as someone else as it turns into a game of luck rather than skill. If you can avoid it, do, if you can't, just try to get to the first weapon you locate faster than the other player. If you see him grab a weapon before you, try to run out the house to the next one to find a weapon of your own.

## 3. Inventory management and weapon choice 
---   
Here I will try to lay out the different items that currently exist in Fortnite BR and establish some kind of priority list amongst them, to show you exactly what should you drop and what should you take.  

### 3.1 Items    
First, let's get to know every item currently available in Fortnite BR. We can divide these items in four categories; traps, grenades, shields/healing and weapons. There are four different rarities in items, represented by colors (the differences amongst which we will discuss in the next point), which are; common (white), uncommon (green), rare (blue), epic (purple) and legendary (orange). Let's start sorting;  
**Traps**  
Traps are fully stackable, which means that whenever you see one, you should grab it as it will take no space in your inventory. Further discussion in the use of traps will be held in the building department.  

*Launchpad*  
The launchpad is the most valuable trap and comes in epic rarity. It allows you (or other players) to jumpad if you step on it which makes it very useful when pushing someone or when escaping the storm or a lost fight.  
  
*Campfire*  
The campfire comes in rare rarity and heals you and everyone in your surroundings for 50 hp over 25 seconds. It is a very useful trap as it lets you drop medkits in favour of weapons as you don't have to worry about healing.   
 
*Spike trap*  
The spike trap comes in uncommon rarity and allows you to do 125 damage to any unsuspecting players who come by.    

**Grenades**  
Grenades take a space up your inventory and generally will have to be dumped in favour of healing or weapons. That said, there are certain grenades that can come in handy in specific situations.    

*Damage grenade*  
The damage grenade is an explosive which deals 105 damage and blasts through any buildings. It is good to have if nothing else is available if someone is hiding in a house and you can see an opening through a window, for example, but, generally, you will leave it in favour of other items.    

*Impulse grenade*  
The impulse grenade does just what its name says, it impulses whoever it impacts upon. It can propulse people up or sideways be it foe or ally, or even yourself. It can be used to throw people off of bases or to get you up there taking anyone by surprise. It can also be used to escape the storm if it is closing by by throwing it right below you and letting it propulse you towards safety. I would generally prefer having an impulse grenade over any other, except perhaps C4.    

*Boogie bomb*  
This thing is really good early game. If you find a boogie bomb at the start of a match and you have a player nearby, just make him dance while you line up your shotgun headshot to take him out without taking damage. Just be aware of the time it lasts, which is not much and also of note boogieing yourself. However, I would drop it in favour of a weapon or other grenade.   
 
*C4*  
C4 is exactly what it sounds like. It will come in packs of four and will allow you to place charges anywhere but on players and remotely detonate it. 3 charges will kill anyone (as each charge does around 70 damage) and it is a good grenade to keep to demolish bases of unsuspecting players.       

We can then conclude that, in grenades, the preferred order is C4 &gt; Impulse grenades &gt; Boogie bomb &gt; Explosive grenade. This is however, very personal, but if you have no idea how to go about prioritizing grenades, this should be a good orientation.

**Healing/Shields**    

*Bandages*  
Bandages come in packs of 5 and will heal 15 hp each up to a maximum of 75 hp. This means that you cannot fully heal even if you are fully stacked with bandages. Bandages should only be in your inventory if no other healing item is available to you.  
  
*Med-Kit*  
The Med-Kit heals all your missing health over 10 seconds. You can stack up to 3 kits. Med-kits are really useful when the storm is eating you up as they let you fully recover. You should drop 15 bandages in favour of 1 Med-Kit, generally. 
  
*Small shield*   
Small shields give you 25 shield very rapidly, up to 50 shield. You can stack up to 10 minishields. Late into the game, the best consumable to have are shields, because only taking up one slot, you get 250 shields, which is more than twice as much as the next best alternative. Plus, it takes a relatively low time to take.
  
*Big shield*   
The big shield gives you 50 shield points over 5 seconds, up to a 100. You can only stack up to two, which normally means that you should give them up in favour of minis.  
  
*Slurp juice*  
The slurp takes two seconds to use and gives you 25 of each shield and hp overtime. You can stack up to two. If you find a slurp, are full health and don't want to give up inventory space, you should drink it in case you get in a fight, as it will heal you overtime, also, that denies it from other players.   

*Chug Jug*  
The Chug heals you for all your health and for all your shield. It is a legendary item and a very good one at that. The downsides are that it is not stackable and it takes 15 seconds to drink it, rendering it useless in a fight. Because of this long drink time, if you find one and you already have some minis stacked, you should drink it on the spot and keep the minis, which come much more in handy in a gunfight.  

Now that we have talked about the different types of healing items, an important notion to have is to not be conservative of healing items. If you have 75 shield and get a big shield, don't wait to lose that 25 to drink it, just drink it right away so that you don't have to carry it and you are more likely to survive a sniper shot or an unexpected gunfight. Same goes for health and medkits. If you are clear of the storm, just use the medkit for that 20 health you lost when you fell down the mountain, you never know when someone might shoot at you and drop you really low, just think that a med-kit won't do much if you are dead (same for shields). We can now establish a priority in healing items, although, as with everything else, it depends on personal preference. This priority means what you want to carry if you are out of slots, so, as I remarked, if you can't bring it, drink it.

Small shields (5+) &gt; Chug Jug &gt; Big Shields &gt; Med-Kit &gt; Slurp &gt; Bandages  


Shields should always have preference over hp healing items because that is what you lose first on a gunfight and being able to quickly regain shield will allow you to win more fights. Plus, bandages and Med-Kits are more common and will generally be carried by other players so you can heal up after killing them, while shields are more scarce as they are more likely to be used by players and because of the rarity difference. 

**Weapons**

I would like to establish a priority right away, just to give you a general idea. First, there are six weapon categories, let's start with Assault Rifles. As a note, and to avoid controversy, these are MY preferences and it is not necessarily what you should run. Again, this priority list is for those that don't know what to take in a situation when they are faced with a weapon choice.

*Assault Rifles* (I will count the Scoped AR as a sniper)

Scar &gt; Blue AR &gt;  Blue Burst &gt; Green AR &gt; White AR &gt; Green Burst &gt; White Burst

The Scar is undoubtedly the best assault rifle in the game. Little drawback, great precision and even greater damage, if you manage to get your hands on one, you will have a good advantage over other players with inferior rifles. The blue AR is similar to the scar, with lower damage and worse stats overall. It is, however, a very good weapon that you can carry over to the end of the game. I prefer it over the blue burst because of the ability to spam bullets to break fortifications, which can be difficult with a burst weapon. Next follows the blue burst, which is actually amazing. If you can manage to line up a clean headshot (which, thanks to the weapons precision, is not extremely hard), you will one shot anyone. It is a great mid-long range weapon but falls off in short distances and that's why it is ranked below the automatic blue AR. The same goes for the other side of the priority list. Regarding the burst vs AR discussion, while it is true that the burst can laser anyone if you hit a good shot, and AR is generally more versatile because of the fire rate and the damage loss is not that significant. That said, the purpose of this weapon ranking is not to establish some absolute truths, just to orientante those players who do not know what to choose. Every player should use the gun they are more comfortable with.
  
*Shotguns*

Purple Tac &gt; Green Pump &gt; Blue Tac &gt; White Pump &gt; Green Tac

The Purple Tac is, in my opinion, the best shotgun in the game. The ability to shot multiple times at someone at close range compensates the possible misses you may have and due to the amount of damage it does, you should be able to one-hit headshot most people. The possibility on headshotting someone is increased as multiple shots are fired, which is why it outweighs the pump. Next we have the pump, which can one shot people in the head. The only problem is that the time between firing each round is pretty large in the context of a close combat which forces you to change to your automatic weapon after firing just one shot, and if that one shot is a miss, you are in a huge disadvantage. This is compensated with its sheer output of damage, almost a 100 to the chest. Next, and for similar reasons come the Blue Tac, White Pump and, at the bottom, the Green Tac.    
A great strategy regarding shotguns is carrying two. If you carry a Pump and a Tac, you can fire your Pump for a great amount of damage and quickly switch to your Tac for an increased firerate. This way, you bypass the limited fire rate of the Pump while accessing its damage.  The downside is obviously that you effectively lose one slot to carry two weapons but if you like being overaggressive, I recommend trying it out.

*SMGs*  
  
SMGs are underrated in Fortnite BR. These weapons can dish out a ton of bullets in a split second and demolish bases on their own. That said, if you had to choose, an AR is generally better for its versatility.

Purple SMG &gt; Blue SMG &gt; Blue Silenced SMG &gt; Green SMG &gt; Green silenced SMG &gt; White silenced SMG &gt; Minigun (any rarity)

The reason the minigun is down there is because it is to useless in most situations. When you fire it, you have to wait a moment before it starts dishing out bullets and when firing, it leaves you to exposed. Although I reckon it has its uses in certain situations, I would not take it over another SMG.  

*Pistols*  

Pistols are generally not a good choice of weaponry. However, there are some situations when you might want to have one at hand. There are four variants, the normal pistol, the revolver, the suppressed pistol and the handgun. The normal pistol is useless and only should be used if nothing better is available. Same goes for the revolver, which at a really low fire rate, can't compare with a shotgun, while it offers the same relative utility. The suppressed pistol, however is a good substitute for an AR when paired with an SMG. I would take a orange or purple suppressed pistol over any white AR or burst or even above a green burst. Suppressed pistols are very precise, make little noise, and dish out a decent amount of damage. The only downside is fire rate which is why you should pair it with an SMG. The handgun, on the other hand, acts like a sniper mixed with a shotgun. It is good to finish off players after you damaged them and have to reload and also to snipe people at mid range. It is however, not worth it to give up meds or other weapons to have a handgun in your power.   
To sum up, you should only consider carrying a suppressed pistol if you don't have a good AR and a handgun if you have a spare inventory slot.  

*Snipers*  

Legendary Bolt &gt; Purple Bolt &gt; Blue Bolt &gt; Purple Scoped Ar &gt; Blue Scoped Ar &gt; Legendary Auto Sniper   &gt; Epic Auto Sniper  &gt; Hunting Rifle &gt; Crossbow  

At the top of our list we have the legendary bolt-action sniper. It is awesome. If you manage to hit someone, he will die or be so low that a couple AR hits will finish him off. The only downside is that you have to be able to aim properly because of the low fire rate. Same goes for the other bolt action snipers. Then we have the scoped Ar which is often overlooked. It is basically an AR with a sight. You would be surprised how much damage it can output to people at the other side of the map. Plus, you only have to reload every 20 shots, compared to the 10 of the Auto Sniper. I would rather take the scoped AR than an Auto Sniper. This leads us to the Auto, which is good but not great. It does not do much damage and, for a Sniper rifle, that's what you need as, most times, you will only get one clear shot. The Hunting Rifle is not too good as it is not very precise and its low fire rate makes it inferior to any other sniper, except the crossbow, which is by far the worst one of all. It is useful only if you want to joke around with your enemies, but for any other purpose, use a proper sniper.  

*Explosive weapons*  

Rocket Launcher &gt; Grenade Launcher  

If you manage to get your hand on a Rocket Launcher, you are set on to win the game. It is a rather versatile weapon. You can use it to demolish bases, as a shotgun and even as a sniper. You should almost never renounce to a Rocket Launcher if you see one, maybe even if you already have one as double Rocket Launchers is really hard to counter for your enemies. It is superior to the grenade launcher because of the delay on the launcher explosions and the limitation on range. The only advantage on the grenade launcher is the fire rate. Explosive weapons, because of the building mechanics of Fortnite, are a really powerful weapon and having one puts you in a good position to counter other strategies. To effectively use the Rocket, you should not just spam it at other peoples' fortifications as they will just build up the walls you exploded and you will waste amo and be exposed to potential sniper shots from other players. What you should do is pair Rocket shots with AR shots so that you can destroy walls and let either your ammo or your rockets hit the enemy.     
We shall now mention counter strategies to both explosive weapons.    
In the case of the grenade launcher, you want to move a lot. The strength of this weapon is its fire rate. It can easily slip grenades under your structures faster than you can rebuild them. What you want to do is to leave your position using the chaos caused by the explosions and reposition yourself. You should move either to a spot were the low range of the launcher wont allow it to hit you or you should push directly using a disengaged double staircase. A disengaged double staircase is a double staircase that you build up to two stairs high, drop to the floor and then, before you hit the ground, build another set of double staircases two stairs high and you repeatedly do so until you get near enough the enemy as to make launching grenades dangerous for him. Using disengaged double staircases will allow you to push while avoiding taking fall damage if one of the grenades destroys the first stairs. It will also act as an effective cover of incoming bullets.    
To counter rocket launchers the best strategy is to push. Staying still will give a massive advantage to the enemy as all you will be doing is rebuilding walls and all it takes is one mistake for one rocket to send you to the login screen. You either want to escape to a higher ground to get an angle using disengaged double staircases and walls or to directly push using the same kind of building mechanics. You have to be more careful when pushing than in the case of the grenade launcher as you may have rockets inbound directly aimed at you while on top of your stairs, which is why you should move really quickly and try to put the enemy in a position of close quarters. Also, you should use the time between each launch as a window to push more aggressively as it takes about 2 seconds to reload a rocket launcher.


### 3.2 Differences in weapon rarity    

Most weapons come in different rarities. If you have a green weapon X and find a blue weapon X, you should change gear. But, what exactly changes from every rarity? Well, if you want to know exactly, you can check at https://db.fortnitetracker.com/weapons, but in summary, more damage, more precision and a lesser reload time.  

### 3.3 Inventory setup and order  

Now that you know every item in the game and how it ranks with its own category, what should you be running?   
In Fortnite BR you have five inventory slots which can be filled with the items mentioned above. The ideal setup would be a mid-long range weapon, a close-range weapon, an explosive weapon and meds. Sometimes, it is wise to renounce to some meds in favour of another weapon but you should try to have at least one slot dedicated to healing as you never know when you might get into a fight.
If I had the choice of dropping somewhere and finding any loot I wanted, without counting traps or double launchers, I would choose a Scar, a Purple Tac, a Rocket Launcher, a Bolt and 10 minis. With this setup you should be able to beat anyone in the late game. This kind of setup, however, is normally only possible towards the end of a game, if at all. The common setup you should run consists on an AR, a shotgun, a sniper and some meds. The sniper, if you have a hard time aiming at long distances, should be substituted with something else but keep in mind that this limits your game to mid-short range. It is possible to run double tac renouncing to a med slot to get more shells per second but most times, you won't need to do that to kill someone. On that topic, at the present day the only weapon you should consider running double time is the Rocket Launcher or the shotguns (Tac-Tac or Pump-Tac).   
The minimum core for dealing with most situations consists of an AR and a shotgun, and you should not give that up. The shotgun, in exceptional situations might be substituted with a Launcher, but it is not common that you will need to do that.   
Now that you know what to run on your slots, you will have to order them in a way that it is easy to switch from weapon to weapon. This is especially important in console where you cannot bind weapon slots. You should put your shotgun next to your AR in order to be able to rapidly change between these two midsfight. Generally, you have to think of your AR as the cornerstone and the rest of the weapons as the pillars. Your AR is the most versatile weapon and you should be able to access it at all times. That said, you should find your own setup and order and always run the same. That way, you will build muscle memory and will be able to change weapons with ease.

## 4. Movement  
---
### 4.1 General considerations  

Running is what you will do most in a game of Fortnite BR. You should learn how to do it properly. First, you can run, crouch or sprint. That said, you should never run. It makes you an easy target and gives you nothing in return. The only time you should do it is when shooting at mid-range, to be able to rotate while dishing out bullets. When moving, you should sprint. In BR, you can sprint forever. Sprinting takes you from A to B faster and makes you a harder target to hit. Crouching is good for long-mid range shooting but makes you easier to hit and slower. You should only crouch when in cover and de-crouch as fast as the other player starts shooting at you.  
When running through the fields of Fortnite, you don't want to be an easy target for snipers. That's why you jump while running periodically but unpredictably and why you don't run in a straight line but rather move in a Z shape. This is not exclusive to Fortnite and for good reason. You want to make yourself a hard target to hit so that you can avoid damage if someone starts shooting at you. When sprinting, you should always be trying to cover yourself up with trees or rocks or whatever you can find in order to avoid being hit if someone starts shooting at you. The combination of these two practices will let you dodge incoming bullets that would otherwise give the advantage to your foe. Also, you should try to use the hills as cover and, when given the choice, try to go in the higher ground. If you are higher than your enemies, you can see them while they can not and you can cover while they can not. It is vital that you actively search for high ground when moving as that will avoid being surprised by other players on the field.  
Also, when collecting resources, you should not stand still pickaxing but rather jump or move around.    
Lastly, my recommendation is that you always keep moving. Camping will not allow you to have good enough loot and materials to survive in the late game. Plus, moving is more fun. This leads to my next point and that is, be aggressive. As you become better at the game, you will see that this will come naturally. An aggressive player has more control over fights and the map in general as he gets to set the pace. Also, people do not expect you to put up an offensive early which may let you land some easy kills. That said, if you are still learning, it is okay to be more defensive in some situations as you are still learning building and other useful mechanics but, in the end, you will see that being aggressive will just come out naturally and will give you a good advantage over other players.
  
### 4.2 Sound    
Before playing Fortnite, buy a good set of headsets. Sound is really important, REALLY important. If you have good environmental headsets you can echolocate every player around you, if not, anyone can locate you and you can't locate anyone, you will die before you even know who hit you.  
When traversing Fortnite’s fields, you will hear gunfights. Most of the times (if you have enough health and the you are safe from the storm), you want to go to the source of the gunfire. This will let you get the jump on people as they will be focused on killing another player. If you arrive late, there is a high chance that the remaining player is low on health and you can get a free kill.  

### 4.3 The Storm    
The Storm is a double edged sword. It can be detrimental to you but, if you know how to use it, it can also work for you. First of all, you should always know where the circle is closing in and the time it would take to get there from your position. You have to keep in mind that the first circle closes in the fastest but does the least amount of damage, the second moves a bit slower but does more damage (2 when it settles), etcetera. From the third circle onwards, you can outrun the storm.  
To make the circle work for you, especially in mid to late game, when the circle has a lesser radius, you can ride the storm. Keeping the storm right behind you or at a lateral will allow you to catch people off guard and low on health as well as serving as an effective angle coverer.
Another tip about the storm is not to fear being inside of it if you have a healing items. Being inside the storm will allow you to shoot at enemies before they notice.   
In the earlier parts of the game, you should try to stay always moving towards the circle to avoid getting caught in a fight and having to endure the Storms' punishment.  
The last advice regarding the storm is that when you come out of it, before healing up, you should box yourself so you don't get shot at while healing. This will save your life countless times so do it.

### 4.4 Be aware of your surroundings   
When you move through the map, you have to have eyes everywhere. Check bushes, dark places and every mushroom because a player may be there. While you move, you have to constantly rotate the camera to your surroundings and, once in a while, do a full spin and check that no one is creeping up behind you.   
Also, you have to always think of the terrain as something you can use to your advantage in advance to the initiation of a gunfight. Are you near a mountain?, think how would you get up there if someone started shooting at you. This way you will be able to magnify your chances of surviving fights and getting closer to the win. More on this topic later on the guide.

## 5. Building    
---  
If there is something unique about Fortnite, it is its building mechanics. It is impossible to get good at the game without building. Building is what you have to think when Fortnite is mentioned so let's get right down to it.  

### 5.1 Basics of building    
We all know what building in Fortnite is. You can build walls, stairs, pyramids and floors to build yourself some cover or to overcome some geographical obstacle. You just need ten pieces of materials of any kind to be able to build any of the available objects. In order for you to become good at Fortnite, you need to flawlessly transition between building and shooting. The basic difference between a good player and an average one is its ability to build quickly and efficiently in every situation. 

### 5.2 Materials   
We have wood, bricks and metal. Wood is collected mainly from trees, house furniture and wood pallets. Bricks are collected from stone constructions and metal, from cars and containers, mainly. Wood is the fastest to collect while metal is the slowest, and bricks are in between. There are three variables that change from material to material. First, building health is the health that the structure has while it is in the process of forming (when it is half light blue). In that department, wood has the most health while brick and metal have less. If you are getting shot at, the best material to pull out is wood as it will take more bullets to destroy it in contrast with the other two materials. Another variable is forming time, and again, wood is the quickest, metal the slowest and bricks are in between. The last variable is health at full build. Here, metal has by a large margin the most amount of health, wood the least and bricks are in between.   
So, you want to always have selected wood as the default building material because it will resist more in a panic building situation. If you want to build a base, metal and bricks might come more handy.   
The easiest material to gather is by a large margin, wood. You should always be cutting trees down and breaking pallets in order to be able to defend yourself efficiently in a fight. Try to never be lower than 250 overall materials and, going into the late game, you will most likely need about 600 total.
### 5.3 What to build in different situations   
I will now list a series of situations and explaining how and what you need to build in order to overcome them. More specific situations are explained below.    

*Suddenly getting shot at in the fields*    

This is the most common situation. You are running and suddenly some shots pop your shields and you are helplessly left to die. Well, not anymore. The next time, you will know that as soon as you hear shoots coming your way, you will build a wall in front of you, in the direction of the bullet, if you see it, and then three more walls in every side of you. Now, you will build a stair in the middle and you will have your little box. You can even build higher by placing four more walls on top of the four bottom ones and a floor and a stair or only a stair. Now you can look around and identify the enemy and shoot back or heal and shoot back.  

*You are in the low ground and you see someone shooting you from high ground*  
Although this is a disadvantageous situation, you, as a building prodigy will be able to respond. If there is no terrain around you and you are in the open, you should place a wall and then a floor above your head, to prevent yourself from getting shot in the head. Then, place 3 more walls and box yourself in. Now, identify some natural cover nearby, such as a mountain and create a door in one of your walls and run to the natural cover while creating floors above your head. This should allow you to reposition and gain a better angle at your shooter.  

*Someone is shooting you while you run from the storm so you can't stop and box in*   

In this situation, what you have to do is to keep running, maybe zigzag a little while placing walls between you and the shooter not only where you are in the present but also where you are going to be one second later preventing the shooter from killing you. Once you are clear of the storm, box in and try to gain the high ground.  

### 5.4 The importance of editing   

Once you get your building down, you want to practice editing. You can edit walls to make doors, windows, arches, or even horizontal pillars, stairs can be rotated and you can even create a spiral staircase, floors can be opened up and pyramids can be turned into stairs and opened on some side. There are multiple possibilities and you have to learn them. It is very important that you get down as that will allow you to take your game to the next level. Just to put an example, if you box yourself in and place a roof on top, and the enemy gets on top of your floor and starts shooting down you could wait until he shoots it and you down and die or you could edit the piece he is standing on and make him fall confused while you shotgun him in the face. Or, another example, in a building standoff, you end up boxed in below your opponents stairs and he starts shooting down at you. You could just wait up and die or you could edit one of the walls, make a door, then place a floor in front of you, some stairs, and boom, you have regained the high ground and are now in a position to kill your opponent. If you had pickaxed your wall, you would have been rendered vulnerable and have gone much much slower, allowing your opponent to finish you off. 
Editing is important when getting up your base after going down without placing new stairs, it is important to make a fast escape, it is important for every reason you can imagine and you have to learn how to do it. There are many tutorials on reddit and on youtube such as https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/84xvar/fortnite_editing_walls/, for example and you should really look into them.

### 5.5 Traps    
Traps are an interesting mechanic. We have already gone through the different traps that exist in Fortnite so let's explain now when to place them down and how. Note that you can not place traps on other player's fortifications.   
The spike trap should be placed down where it is hard to see, preferably facing downwards and right after a door. This way, unsuspecting players will get killed and you can go back and grab their loot. Also, when building a base, it is often wise to place some traps at your sides to work as a welcoming gift to any unrequested visitors (especially for dealing with people who jump pad onto you), as traps do not damage its placer.  
Campfires should be used on top of a floor and you just have to wait around to get healed. A good strategy to heal yourself while you shoot is to box yourself, place a floor on the bottom, place the campfire and then place a stair on top. You will get healed while also being able to respond to enemies by shooting them in the face.  
Lastly, we have the most fun trap of all, the launchpad. Place it down on a floor and when you or any player jump on it, you will fly across the sky. It is a very useful trap and very versatile. You can use it to escape the storm, to escape a tricky situation or to push your enemies. A good use for it is to push bases of unsuspecting players, to do so, just go to a high enough place, place your jump pad and jump behind the enemies. If they don't turn, just shotgun them in the face, if they do, place a floor by their wall and then use stairs to push them.  
It should be noted that traps cannot be picked up once placed and will be destroyed if shot at. The only trap that does not have unlimited uses is the campfire, that extinguishes after its use.

Yes, winning is already super satisfying, but I feel like there should be a better way to show off your wins besides a single umbrella for the season....  Here’s my pitch:

Victory Tokens - or what ever, more clever name you may have for them - could be provided at the end of the game with your Victory Royale. 

- You would get x amount of tokens per win.
And maybe get an additional x (smaller) amount of tokens per kill in the games that you win. 

- Make a permanent store that doesn’t have a rotation, but tiers of rewards that cost more Victory Tokens the higher the rarity. Collect all of the cheap rewards? Or save up for that expensive, legendary skin?

- Change the content in the store every season.

- Show off said rewards in game (that cannot be otherwise bought with V-Bucks).

I’d love to hear the community’s suggestions as well, as this is something I thought of the other day after accumulating some wins!

One of the ways that would make it way more fun is if you could choose or bet (not actual money but for XP or battle pass stars) who you think is going to win the match. 

Your options would be:

- The player you’re currently spectating

- All other players (the field)

If you pick the player you’re currently spectating, the reward for guessing correctly is much higher than if you pick all other player and guess correctly. 

Some specifics:

- The rewards would be XP or battle pass stars.

- The amount of the reward would be calculated in the following way:
  
   - Picking the player you’re currently watching and guessing correctly: 100 XP or 1 battle pass star multiplied by the number of other players remaining (not including the player you’re spectating). For example, if there are 10 total players left and you pick the player you’re currently spectating and they win, you’d win 900 XP or 9 battle pass stars. 
     
    - Picking all other players (the field) and guessing correctly: always 100 XP or 1 battle pass star

- You have to spectate until the end of the game to receive your reward.

- If you choose the player you’re spectating to win and they die, you can’t choose again for that match. 

- There could also be some sort of risk like losing XP or BP stars if you guess wrong but that could also be technically gambling so maybe not.

I know that the console is way past its prime, and because of miss steps from Sony, this is never going to happen.

But, the Vita, is capable of proper multiplayer, is a proper portable games console, and best of all, has two sticks for shooter style games!

I think when Blitz leaves and Epic, inevitably, buff resource gains from trees etc to some happy medium in base game; we're going to see an overall increase in skill across the community and the building battles we love will become more frequent.

I end up running around with Mini Shields only as health regen options. I think this would work well. Also I think if they reduce the materials to 500 (per material) instead of 999 and with the back bling you can increase to 999.

- Blitz mode to the be the main game
- Make the loot spawn in the main game the same as Blitz
- Make the resource farming rate the same in the main game as Blitz

I think we're all riding the hype right now with Blitz mode. It's really fun, fast paced, and cool. But I think if the main game played at the pace of Blitz Mode and it was all we had... it would lead to massive burnout.

Something that makes the insane moments in Fortnite feel so amazing is the time between those moments. In Blitz mode there isn't any time between fights, it is one long fight. There isn't any time to bullshit with your friends because you're constantly fighting, pushing, fighting. There isn't any time to relax, take a breath, and prepare for the next fight.

And as far as the resource farming rate goes I think we should be careful about requesting TOO many resources in the main game. I wouldn't mind getting a few more resources per hit, but I also don't want to stand outside of somebody's 1 by 1 for 5 minutes trying to break through their 3000 material supply.

Aim assist isn’t helping you while you’re in the air. Definitely shoot in the air if you know you can hit your shot and it’s giving you an advantage. 

• Aim down sight right before you shoot. 

Aim assist really locks onto your target when you do this. 

• Build before you engage. 

You’ll throw your enemy off and you get to choose when to engage. Most of the time people will try to run around your building when you do this and they become really predictable.

• Aim with your movement. 

Once your crosshairs are in the vicinity of the target, aim by moving left or right. It’s much harder to move your gun than to take a couple of steps to the right or left. Especially if you have a higher sensitivity for fast building. 

• Go to Tilted and get into as many shotgun fights as possible. 

Sometimes you just need the experience. A lot of people might know what to do but they just need the practice of doing it. 

I’d love to hear tips that helped you! I’m not a god by any means. These are just things that helped me to stop sucking as bad. If you find this stuff helpful, I was thinking about making a video with all of these examples.

Bundle + S2 BP = 30 Tiers.

55 By that logic. However daily quests of 5stars each for ~32 days, = 16 tiers.

16 + 25 + 30 = 71. Most avid players could be at Level 50-60. Average that on 5*10 [5 stars at 5,15,25,35,45 levels] + 10*10 [10 stars at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] + (2*8*5) = 150+80 = 230 [16 stars for every 10 levels excluding 5's and 10's, multiplied by 5]
 = 23 tiers.

Therefore, by that logic uptil now most people could be Tier 90-95, assuming They do all their daily challenges, bought the bundle, have finished every weekly challenge and are above Level 50 of the Battle Pass.

2. I don’t like the idea that if you don’t insta kill someone you’ll then have to shoot though 20 walls to kill them (I’m  exaggerating but you get my point)
3. I like the more realistic over the cartoony look.
4. I don’t have a lot of free time and I need to know if my first 3 points would cause me to not like the game no matter how long I played it.

Also, Please give it at least a week or so to see if you will actually get sick of it or not, how anyone can come here after the mode being out for 23 hours, claiming they want it to replace normal mode, just chill.

I feel every time a LTM comes out, everyone is quick to be like ""OMFG MAKE IT PERMANENT PLZZZ"" only because its a change from the normal, We all play the normal that much we like a little change when it happens, but god damn, making it anything other than an LTM will ruin the novelty IMHO.

The top 5 players (based on kill count in that game) are put into a single team, they remain wherever they are. Their weapons are all upgraded to Legendary status with extra ammo and resources. They get full health and Shield. If they have empty bag slots these are filled with random weapons/items of Legendary level.

The remaining 45 are all placed into teams of 5 as well, but with the sole aim of taking out the top 5. They get no special buffs and if they kill one of the top 5 only one of their weapons drops.

So effectively 45 vs 5

The best against the rest.

I think it could prove challenging for both sides, the best players (by kill count/aggression) would have the weapons and tech, but the rest would have the numbers. You could either play to conservatively to make sure you get on the team of 45, or go all out and go for Legendary status.

One change that would help this

Change eliminate opponent with ""weapon"" challenges to need to knock them, not eliminate a down opponent with said weapon.

We find it fun and interesting, I’m sure. But it’s not healthy for the game in the long term if it is brought back.

I’m going to use another game as an example. League of Legends. They have a limited time mode called “URF.” This mode essentially negates the need to manage your mana/energy resource, and allows you to cast spells really damn often- 80%CDR. It also gives you some extra attack speed and some other minor buffs.

However, the mode was deemed unealthy for the game, as after the mode was over, players would quit, many of them not coming back, which was attributed to being the fact URF was too hyper of a mode and left players burnt-out.

Now let’s take a look at Blitz.

The rounds last 15 minutes; you get extra materials and extra launchpads. Everything is quick. It’s not very healthy for the game though, as even though we don’t have any statistics yet, we can see from League and its large playerbase something like this is likely to happen after Blitz Mode.

Safe to say, I'm here to stay!  

So I have a squad of 4 and we are all relatively good considering we have only been player for 2 weeks. So far we have 28 Squad wins. This game suits my play-style as I grew up with Quake and Unreal Tournament, and I fancy myself as an above-average Overwatch player. 

So we learnt quite quickly that this game suits the aggressor. And as a team, when we push another team we normally come out on top, unless we whiff a couple of shots or they rocket our feet (which really upsets me). But 9 times out of 10, we win the fight. However, we found that as the defenders, we pretty much lose every time.  

So I was wondering if any experienced players can tell me what we're doing wrong. As the team being pushed, do we leave the fort we built and try and turn the table, try and become the aggressor as such? Or do we hold our ground and learn how to defend. I just feel that every time we get pushed we lose. What do you do when your fort is being pushed by another squad?

Sadly, that wont be good for the game. Imagine trying to fight a guy in a city who's opened 3 chests and now has 200 resources. That's 20 walls you have to get through with maybe just a common AR that has 48 shots and your green pump with 10-15 shots. It would just make for a very frusturating early game based on whoever gets the most chests. 


In my opinion, epic should simply make the materials gained from harvesting ramp up with the circle getting smaller. Theres many reasons that I think this would be good for the game. Firstly, as the circle gets smaller hitting trees becomes extremely risky. Snipers start to line up shots and if you accidently knock down a tree that has already been harvested to (50) then everyone looking in that direction just found you. That is why the risk should match the reward. If you are on say the third circle and you hit down a tree that normally gives 50-60 wood you should now be rewarded with 150-180 wood. In addition, as the circle gets smaller there becomes inherently less things to harvest. If the circle is closing in a place like tilted towers theres almost nothing to farm up and if you find yourself in a few building battles you may be completely out of resources. However, if you make a wall give 30 brick instead of 10 brick, there becomes real value in just hitting something close to you and going from there. 


Either way, I think that materials are becoming more and more scarce with the last couple of nerfs to trees and what not and this may address the mid game issues people are running into. I know some people prefer less resources but they probably camp bushes and build 1x1 bases on top of mountains.",FortNiteBR

I must be one of the very few people who doesn’t want a separate build sensitivity. I spent a *very* long time getting used to a higher sensitivity (7/7). It seems unfair for them to add a separate build sensitivity just to cater to low sensitivity players (5 and under). Use a low sensitivity for better hipfire, but slower building. Use a higher sensitivity for faster building, but more difficulty hipfiring. It’s that simple. Those are the pros/cons to low/high sensitivity. If you want to build faster, get out of your comfort zone and up your sensitivity. A separate build sensitivity would make all the time we’ve spent adjusting to a higher X and Y sensitivity go to waste. I’m sure everyone else who plays on a higher sensitivity can agree with me here. Besides, let’s be real, if a build sensitivity is added, literally *every* console player will be on an X and Y sensitivity of 5 or less. The result of this? You can bet your ass you’ll be getting insta-killed by shotguns much more often.

I landed on the grocery store and picked up a green tactical shotgun, I entered the door to my left and instantly saw a guy down the stairs, I ran his direction and gave him a full shot to the head, killing him immediately. I looted his body and got 50 shield, upon hearing some gunfire towards the building next to mine I ran up the stairs and saw two people in an intense firefight. I ran towards one of the guys and he one-pumped me to 30 health I shot at him with my only weapon and being the lucky guy I am, got a headshot and killed him. Meanwhile the other guy he was fighting had run off and waited for our duel to end, he rushed towards me, but I quickly finished him off with an AR I had looted from the other guy's body. At this point I was still around 30 hp but luckily there was a chug jug in the pile of loot, I drank up and went through the remaining loot, picking up a blue bolt, grey pump, some bandages and a blue AR. I saw a guy towards the houses and made quick work of him with my sniper and ran towards salty. Along the way I saw a dude peeking out of his base trying to shoot someone opposite me, I whipped out my bolt and one shot him for 210 health. Immediately after I sniped him I started getting bombarded with shots from what could only be a scar, I built a quick base and started shooting back. Meanwhile the guys who was shooting me got caught up in some other shenanigans with some people trying to flank him from the sides, he made mince-meat out of them quickly picking up 3 kills with his green pump, needless to say, I was scared this would be my end. I hail married in his direction and saw that he was busy healing up, I got the jump on him and killed him quickly. The 4 bodies there were a gold mine for weapons and resources, I picked up his golden scar, purple bolt green pump and stacked some more bandages. On my way to the next circle I came across a supply drop and it gave me the only thing anyone could want in a top 10 situation, the golden RPG, I was so hyped because I rarely get to use RPGs and they are one of my favorite weapons. I built up around me and saw a guy instantly start firing rockets at me, we were in the middle of the worlds longest rocket battle when I heard a guy coming up from behind me, I do a quick 180 and one shot him with a rocket. Back to fighting the guy across from me I guess. After another 10 rockets I hear something else from behind, I whip around and one pump a dark voyager behind me, but not after he could bring me all the way down to 17 health. To my surprise he had 2 chug jugs on him, I quickly trade one out for my bandages and start chugging. Half way through my jug I remember that the last guy's rockets will kill me if he gets lucky and hits the stairs behind me, to my relief I finish my chug jug and get back I to my base. The next circle appears and I notice that the other guy sees too, its closing around him, but he puts down a launch pad and shoots up into the air. While he is gliding down I pull out my scar and shoot him out of the air. #1 victory royale.

PS: Sorry that this is so long, I wanted to get it down since it is still fresh in my mind. Hope you enjoyed.

A similar thing happened in League of Legends with a game mode called 'URF' where they removed every champs resources, removed death timers, reduced every skill cooldown by 80%, increased gold income by 5x etc. This created super fun and fast paced 10-20 minute games rather then the usual 30-40.


This mode would be implemented for weeks at a time and everyone including my group of friends would binge this non stop over the traditional game. The problem with this was that when it was over the traditional game was way too slow and grindy so we'd stop playing for weeks, and in several occasions id had friends that never played again.


This problem is very real as it was even acknowledged by Riot themselves 
https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/12/ask-riot-urf/


""Every time we ran regular URF, we’d see a huge spike of games being played, and then the numbers actually dropped back down to a level that’s lower than it was just before we ran URF.


It’s normal for new players to join League and for some longtime players to leave—this happens all the time. But when we turned on regular URF, it was different. In NA, for example, whenever we ran URF we’d usually see over twice as many longtime players leave the game compared to what we would’ve normally expected.


In other words, some people binged on URF, and then suddenly stopped playing League. And the size of the dropoff indicates that it’s not just people coming back for URF and then leaving afterwards. Despite spending a lot of time investigating the reasons, we aren’t actually sure whether URF causes some sort of “hangover” effect or if it makes regular games feel slow by comparison—maybe it’s because URF feels like playing League with cheats turned on. Regardless, after we turn on URF, total games played go down, as do overall game hours. And they don’t recover for a long time, if ever.""


So yeah, i love this game too much for it to suffer like this


tl;dr - URF mode (a fast paced version of the game like Blitz) in League of Legends led to a large amount of players leaving the game due to the traditional games being extremely slow and grindy in comparison",FortNiteBR

I already had an Epic Games account and simply installed Fortnite there and played Save the World. Fast forward a few months and I purchase a PS4 to play Battle Royale with my friends (almost none of them had PCs). After installing it and booting the game up, my friends were eager for me to join the lobby and play, when prompted to sign in with an Epic Games account, I chose ""No thanks"" and began to play. On this account, I purchased a Battle Pass as well as some skins here and there and way surpassed what I had done on PC. One of my friends who did have a PC was able to ""cross-progress"" if you would say between the accounts, meaning the Battle Pass he purchased on console could be used on PC and all of his wins saved onto PC. I wanted to do this as well, I went into my Epic Games account and attempted to link my PS4 account but was met with a message that said something along the lines of ""Your PSN account is already linked"" or something like that. So basically, I fucked myself from the start by not logging in with my Epic Games account. I went looking around the internet for an answer, and most of them told me to upgrade it with a different email from the one on my PSN, which is an issue because my PSN email is the same email as my Epic Games account that I'm trying to link. I sent Epic Games an email about and was linked to a page that suggested the same thing about using a different email.



**tl;dr - Had an Epic Games account on PC with Fortnite and bought stuff, created a ghost account on PS4 and bought stuff, now unable to cross progress and use stuff that I bought across platforms.**

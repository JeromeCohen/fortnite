Or more accurately, I'm terrible at the combat in this game.

To be honest, I'm not a huge gamer. I mostly stick to sports or wrestling games and do local multiplayer with a few friends. I defintely wouldn't usually consider myself a fan of shooters, but something about the battle royale concept was very intriguing.

So I start playing fortnite because it's free and I honestly love it. It was pretty thrilling being 1 of 100 random people with no markings on the radar where people are. It didn't matter that I wasn't good, I was new to not just the game, but shooters or battle type games in general. I figured I'd improve over time.

Well I've played 400 matches of this game in under 2 weeks and my God am I amazed at how awful I still am at the combat. I can honestly count on one hand the amount of times I've killed somebody in a 1 v 1 battle. I have like 75 kills total and 95% of them are either luck or stealth.

It seriously baffles me how people are so accurate at this game. I just had a dude with no weapon (I had 3) jump around 5 feet away from me for over a minute while I wasted all of my ammo trying to kill him. He then killed me the kick axe because I couldn't manage to hit him with that either.

I'll run down a hallway, there will be someone crouched with their back to me, I'll shoot them twice in the back of the head with a shot gun and they turn around and kill me with a couple of shots. Doesn't matter if they have a pistol or whatever. I die.

I seriously have no idea how a person can do anything over 400 times in under 14 days and get literally no better at it, but I've managed to do it.",FortNiteBR

- Building bug is still an issue (where you cant build for no reason), are you fucking serious? i remember the building bug being around well before Christmas and its still not fixed? c'mon epic...

- I won 3 squad games today and not one of them is showing up on my stats, not to mention every other game wasn't being accounted for in my stats / both in game or on Fortnite Tracker. As i'm trying to keep a track on my K/D... had a 15 kill game where i died and finished 6th but according to the stats it never happened.

- Cant pick up weapons for no reason whatsoever

- crosshair randomly disappears and then just as randomly it decides to come back

- Building feels really laggy, I don't know if this is because of the general server lag but sometimes when i press a building hotkey it takes half a second longer for the build to actually come up - i've found this to be a real issue especially when putting down floor builds.

- scrubs still running around with double pump like they own the place... seriously fix this.. If you're going to make the pump one shot kill don't allow players to carry two or at least make it so that you actually have to cock the gun and not just bypass it by switching weapons. I refuse to use double pump shotguns. Why would I want to run around with two of the same gun when I can easily use up that slot on a sniper or heals/shield. you want a fast firing shotgun? that's what the tactical is for. 

I've spent way to much money on this game to have a shitty gaming experience like I have been having since the latest update dropped and yet epic are still force feeding us new skins in the item shop. Skins no one asked for but yet they're ignoring all the game breaking bugs that are plaguing your servers right now.

I'm seriously considering going back to pubg even though that game has its own issues with bugs and glitches its NO WHERE near as bad as Fortnite has been since the last update. Rant over.",FortNiteBR

Let's start with the negatives of this change because it's easy: **There are none.**

Now for the pros:

* All of the grenades are cool. Even the smoke grenades. No one will use 3 slots for all three grenades. Hell, good players probably can't justify one slot unless they are trying to get a cool clip with the impulse grenade.

* if you make a good player choose, they will take something better than any of the grenades. If you just give them the grenades anyway, the crazy plays would increase exponentially. 

* The main thing(IMO) that sets this game apart is the feeling that you can weasel your way out of almost any situation. All it takes is skill, creativity, and improvisation. Having assorted nades will remove any doubt that you could have played better if you die. 

* skill floor stays the same, skill ceiling rises=always a good thing.

Last but most important in my opinion(with a lot of speculating)

* As the general playerbase gets better, we are going to see more and more defensive camping in towers mid-late game. All the grenade types give the attacker more tools to push a camper on the high ground. All games that give the defender a better overall advantage than the attacker is a design flaw. (*We don't know for certain whether the defenders actually have an advantage yet, so I could be way off base here*)

Specifically how would it look? I don't really care. a grenade button with a right click cycle like materials would work.

They destroy structures way too quickly and you don't need to put yourself at risk by using them at all while they provide an insane amount of pressure, another weapon in the game that does the same thing as rockets is the minigun which destroys bases but you need to expose yourself to do it, it puts high pressure on the enemy while you're tearing down the base but you leave yourself open so they can either try to take the fight with you or attempt to build through the shots which is impossible if they have a lot of ammo, RPGs on the other hand are able to do the same amount of damage while staying completely safe and do insane amount of damage to structures and players and it's really unbalanced and gives people with them way too much power. The only argument that I could think of for having them is that they are rare so people don't have them often but I think that's a terrible way to design items in any game because if you have one you're almost guaranteed to win if you have a brain, I've won quite a few games just because I had an RPG and all I had to do was shut off my brain and spam rockets at the last guy until he ran out of materials and was forced to try to engage me in my 1 by 1 tower which was basically impossible because he cant build up to me because I keep taking his shit down until I finally kill him. RPG's are essentially free wins to anyone with an OK level of skill and the damage should be at the very least heavily nerfed against players so you're not able to spam rockets into someone for 2 years while they can't do anything against it and they will at least have the possibility of trying to engage you. Personally I'd rather it just not be in the game at all because it's a really dumb weapon that gives people too much power and pressure over players.

The main disadvantage pump shotty supposed to have is it's lower fire rate, so you can't have a second chance with it in a close firefight compared to tac shotty.

But, double pumping **glitch** eliminates this disadvantage and makes you a literal death machine. The counter-arguments are complete bullshit as well, let me break them down to you both of the main ones.

1)It requires skill

No it does not. No it does not. No. it. does. not. How hard do you think it is to press a key after you shoot? It's not hard. It doesn't have a high skill ceiling or anything, you're just trying to make yourself look better by saying that, so you can use the glitch call yourself skilled at the same time.

2)It takes 2 inventory slots which puts you a big disadvantage

There are 5 slots. AR/Pump/Pump/Bolt/Minis is enough for EVERY firefight in the game, you have AR for medium range, pumps for close range, and bolt for long range. inb4 ""oh no, no explosives"" You don't need explosives 99% of the time, you can always build your way out and in a firefight, so it's not a big deal. 

And some people are gonna be like, ""lmao look at this noob all angry about double pumps I bet he never even had a win xd"", let me show you my stats so that you don't think that way. While I'm no ninja, myth or svennoss, I can hold myself fairly well and have played lots and lots of matches so I think my opinion is relevant. 

Thanks for listening, and Epic, please stop ruining the game any further with every new update, and fix double pumping while you're at it.

Before you tell me ""Use boogie bomb"" or ""Camp the whole match"". No. Fuck off, I won't stoop to a level such as low as that to get a win. It's not victory, it's bitter cruelty.

All I need is one win, and I can finally decide whether to continue playing or not. But as it stands, I'm gonna be enslaved to this game until I die. I'll probably reinstall the game in a few hours.

The problem is you don’t actually get your +1 bullet until a second or so after the animation finishes (im on Xbox btw).  Watch next time you reload the sniper: your character puts the mag in, cocks the gun (at which point it should be all ready to go but it isn’t), then there’s an extra second or so before your character twitches slightly (end of animation) and you get your +1 bullet.

For me this is really frustrating because realistically the animation should finish the moment the bullet is loaded in the gun.  You should be able to switch guns as soon as you hear the click that your character cocked the gun, but if you do that, when you switch back to your bolt later expecting it to be loaded, you’ll find that there’s nothing in the chamber and you have to do the whole reload over again.  This happens to me too often!

This definitely needs to be fixed somehow.  For the record, I’m not suggesting that the reload time be shortened.  Just that you should be able to have a ready-to-fire gun as soon as you see/hear your character load and cock it.",FortNiteBR

And you can be sure that if you finish one of my mates for no reason, then I will do everything to finish one of yours as well. Now both teams are screwed, bravo.

Now I get that you would want to kill that person to get their loot (especially in early-game), but there are definitely instances, where people are fully looted or in the middle of a fight, so that argument does not always work.

So why not give players an incentive to not purposely screw up games for others? That could be either a penalty for doing it or a reward for not doing it.

**Some ideas** (I'm sure we could come up with more reasonable things):

If a player is finished, before his team is downed:

* only half of his ammo and/or materials are dropped
* one or some of his weapons aren't dropped

Or if a player is finally eliminated, because his team is as well as opposed to him being finished before that:

* have him drop an extra small potion/slurp
* have him drop more ammo/materials

Wouldn't such a small thing make this game more enjoyable for all of us?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this!

Now, this store i'd like to be seasonal exactly like the battle pass. The credits you get after a win, idk, maybe 10-20? With skins costing around 100 credits (rough ideas). Yes, people will argue ""Why not just buy the skins"".. But for me, a £20 purchase of 2800 V-Bucks to get ONE skin just isn't great at all and will not be affordable continuously for others too.

In this store, would be gliders, emotes, skins, pickaxes just like the normal store. I think this would be great for many reasons, which in my opinion I don't even think it will decrease Epic's revenues from purchasing V-Bucks. It brings a more competitive aspect to the game, more people want to win but some will just give up and just buy a skin anyway.

The store, i'd love to stay the same during the entirety of the season, maybe have some higher priced skins which look even better than purchasable skins, just to have something more to aim for. I'd also love if the credits/currency from the wins, would be generated in the next seasons store, so you can keep saving and ultimately, keep winning for more credits!

Feel free to add suggestions and feedback, it's a very basic yet I believe a very efficient idea. With more work on it, I can really see it evolving in any direction it possibly needs to which in turn could even bring a huge competitive outlook on the game, more than it already has. 

Thanks!

Recently with the reactivated bandwidth Hud we can all see that most of our Pings are way to high, mostly doubled which causes delays and unsmooth gaming experineces (delayed dmg and building etc..)

Packet loss is insanely high, causing Rubberbands and Hitmarkers (Dmg not counting) which is gamebreaking at this state as every 3rd guy experiences lags. This is also the reason of lag spikes and stutters which lets you teleport back or forward, let you fall of edges and jitters jumping animations.

For stability: alot are complaining about Fps drops, Audio issues, some other bugs like game freezes, crashes, crosshair bugs etc..This should be taken for granted to fix in the next patch!

So, as the title says, I’m fairly new to the game(I know I’m a bit late lol), and after playing for about  week or 2, I just have a few things I’d like to say:

1. This is probably my biggest concern about the game. I love the game so far, it’s fun, and addicting, but they REALLY need to add some form of training in the game. I started a bit late, so I had no idea how to play, what buttons did what, how to build, nothing, and there are players who spend their lives playing and can build a 10 story sniper tower in 1 minute sniping you from a mile away. I had to go through multiple different rounds, jumping in and getting killed, having to start over, and repeating this multiple times before I understood all of the controls, and even now I’m not that great at then builds. They should add a stage where you can just go in, practice your shots, practice building, etc. I would really like to practice building towers I’m seconds without struggling when switching between walk and stair and jumping while watching my back, but you just can’t do that in the middle of the game without dying and having to start over. It’s just kind of sucky that they just throw you into the game with no clue how to even switch between weapons and walls in a game where newbs and elites are all in 1 map. When there are players who are just way too damn good, how are you supposed to learn?

2. There are too many glitches on PS4. When switching weapons, if you do it too fast then it automatically goes back to the previous weapon when you get to the one you want, which sometimes causes you to shoot a gun when you’re trying to heal, giving away your location. Or the auto run not turning off when you try to heal or pick something up.

3. PEOPLE ARE TOO DAMN GOOD! How the frick do people build so fast?! xD okay, maybe I just suck here, but seeing people build an entire god damn city in a matter of seconds while I struggle just to build a simple tower makes you feel cruddy! I haven’t even won a single match yet, I can consistently make it to 10th-5th place, have gotten up to 3rd, but once we get to the last few people and it comes to building, I fail and die really quick trying to defend myself.

4. This ones not that important, and it would be hard to implement because there would be people taking advantage of it to get easy wins, but a stage for newer players would be nice. You basically just have 1 option separated into 3 categories(solo, duo, and squad), all of which have players who have been going since the beginning. It would be nice to have stages for lower ranked people so we can just battle each other while we rank up and get the hang of the game, then when we get into the real matches with the better players, we don’t feel like shit getting shot within the first few minutes of the game.

All around though, I do enjoy the game. It’s definitely different than any other game I’ve played and I’m sure once I’be gotten the hang of building quickly, and being able to switch what I’m doing without thinking, I’ll enjoy it a lot more. ",FortNiteBR

He is an avid Battle Royale player on PS4, however, he got interested in playing the Save The World part of the game. He went to the epic website and created an epic games account (forgetting he had already created one when he first played Fortnite BR on PS4). He made this new account and entered a game key for ""Save The World Standard edition"" that I gave him. The problem is now he has two Epic games accounts. One is linked to the PS4 (which has all his purchases from BR), and the new account he created has the save the world content. 

This is very unfortunate as he wanted to play both games under the same account so that he could share V-bucks between them. He hasn't played any game on any of the accounts since this happened, in hopes that the problem can be solved. If there is anything you can do to help it is greatly appreciated. 

I'm writing this here in hopes that the Fortnite devs may take action as soon as possible, I did send a support ticket but we all know that this subreddit is checked more often than tickets.
His old Epic games account (currently linked to ps4 and containing BR purchases) is: ****_5@hotmail.com

His new Epic games account (containing the save the world purchse) is: ****56@gmail.com

If you need to validate any information pertaining to the accounts please tell me.

I consider myself to be pretty tech-savvy. I know my ins and outs of networking and computers. For weeks my best pals and work buddies have been let down by my failed communication in game, getting them and myself killed numerous times. I have a friend who no longer plays the game with me because I can not make crucial call-outs in game. You surely can understand my frustration.

I use a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 with an audio technica XLR microphone. Both Fortnite and Win10 have their audio device set to my interface, the Focusrite. Voice chat is ON, and I have tried both push to talk settings. My microphone does not register in game, in any lobby. I looked up COUNTLESS forum posts offering their solutions that worked for them, however, none of them has worked for me. I play on PC, and my in-game name is Jinxa. I am located on the east side of the United States.

I beg of you, I LOVE this game and I would love to enjoy it to its full potential. I have lost SO MANY games simply because I can not communicate with my team and or friends..this bug has made my recent time playing Fortnite stressful and rage inducing. Do not get me wrong, I haven't enjoyed a game this much since I was a teenager. Which is why this bug REALLY hurts me. Please tell me how we can make this right. I appreciate it in advance.

 - Make your game into window mode, Apply.  

 - Make all the video settings back to what you normally use and put your resolution back to fullscreen, Apply.  

 - Remember to still lock your fps to whatever your screen refreshrate is, haven't tried with unlimited FPS!!

There is apparently an issue (that I am now experiencing) with trying to register your PSN/XBL account to EPIC Games' website if when you first launched Fortnite, you selected ""No Thanks"" when they asked you to register.  

This, apparently, is because for some unknown reason, instead of just keeping you unregistered they assign you with a ""ghost account"" to register with.  So, now, when I go to link my PSN account with my newly created EPIC Games account, it says that my PSN is already associated with a different EPIC Games account.  

Not only is there no easy fix for this by any means, but even the convoluted and difficult fix for this leaves you with no items, your levels reset and basically starting from scratch should you choose to link YOUR PSN account with YOUR EPIC Games account.  

Something doesn't sound right here, does it? It is my understanding that one of the wonderful features added to this amazing game was the ability to play cross platform with all of my PC gamer friends.  So, I set out on a mission to get it to work.  Now, I am finding that the only way to do this is to basically reset my entire account, lose all the $ and remaining v-bucks I'd spent, and begin leveling back to 70 from 1.  

Maybe there has already been a fix and I just for some reason haven't been able to find it, but I'm guessing that is not the case.  

**Can somebody from EPIC comment here so with some clarity? This really isn't cool at all.  Why can't I just switch my email associated with my PSN without losing all of my hard earned useless skins and emotes?**

I have some feedback I'd like to share, and I wonder if other Mac players are experiencing the same things that I am, after this past update.  
  
* There has been a huge increase in in-game lag. Every 60 seconds, my game completely freezes for 10-15 seconds. I've timed it and the problem persists every single minute while I'm playing.
  
* There is a terrible sound delay. Footsteps, gun fire, weapon sounds, etc. are delayed 2-3 seconds AFTER the action. I have been playing with the game on mute because the sound lag becomes too confusing.
  
* Overall, this past update has made the game extremely sluggish. Prior to this past update, my Mac (which is the newest, top of the line 27"" 5K iMac with fully maxed out specs) was running this game incredibly smooth. After the update, even after I set all video settings to the lowest possible, the game is nearly impossible to play.
  
Are any other Mac users experiencing these problems, or any other kinds of problems? Please share, and please share any solutions.
  
Thank you!",FortNiteBR

243,OwenOnReddit,1518813057,7y1oer,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7y1oer/how_does_the_storm_work_planning_how_and_when/,88,How does the storm work? Planning how and when you'll move towards the circle. A Guide:,"Storm Damage
-the storm doesn't take off shield HP, only health HP
-the first storm wave will take off one damage per second
-the second storm wave will take off one DMG/second UNTIL the third circle is released on the minimap, then it will do two damage per second. 
-the first and second storm are faster than you
-now the third wave will do two damage per second UNTIL the fourth circle, then it does five damage but is quite slow, you can easily outsprint, as are the rest of the circles in the match. 
-fourth wave is five DMG/sec until fifth Circle released, then becomes ten, permanent till rest of match. 

How to Heal during the Storm
-the bandage takes four seconds to use, and it's crucial not to move to reset the time needed to bandage, it can be a fatal mistake
-the med kit takes 10 seconds to use
-the slurp will only add 1 HP per second, any higher-DMG storms will only take off one sec/DMG per second for the 25 seconds 

You NEED to take in account how long it takes to use a consumable in the storm, if the storm is taking off 2 DMG a sec, the medkit needs to be used at 20 or above health, etc.

Using a launch pad
-Launch pads are a high risk-high reward way of escaping the storm
-you need to build a high stairway for max effectiveness, but this stairway can be shot down easily, you need to work quickly
-this stairway can also dwindle your resources or be used by others, likely following you to your destination, so watch out

The ""short side"" of the storm
-when seeing the new circle, it tends that one side of the map will have to run longer than another, if you have to run less than the side opposite to you, it will take longer for the storm to start moving towards you. 

Also, never engage with people in the storm unless you seemingly have far superior loot, they start shooting at you, or you can kill them quickly as you are behind them. 

Plan accordingly, and don't screwed over by the storm because of yourself. Fortnite is a fast-paced game and you have to keep up with it. 

Hope this helps!

When everyone drops, it's just like Solo (teams of one). If you knock someone down, you can revive them and then that person would join your team. You can continue to grow your team by knocking and reviving additional players (any of your teammates can 'recruit' players also by knocking/reviving). 

If you are knocked once and revived, then you can no longer be revived (any knockdown on you is an immediate elimination). 

If your squad leader is knocked down and revived by another squad, than your squad merges with the other squad.

Adding a dedicated grenade slot would allow for even more grenade variety, without having to sacrifice an essential weapon or defensive item.


The obvious drawback to adding a grenade slot is the potential of constant grenade spamming, but unlike other games (CoD), you don't start the game with grenades. This can be easily controlled by adjusting drop rates.

The complaints i see on here are sometimes so minuscule to the point where they shouldn't have even been brought up. Now don't get me wrong, i am guilty of doing this my self, but please, let Epic do their job before we confuse the f*ck out of them and have them break the game even more. 

This last update has really hurt the game and makes the playing experience 25% as fun as it used to be. Whether its building bugs, getting shot through closed doors, or gigantic heads floating around in game.. This game is the buggiest it has ever been and i must say, it is our fault. 

Moral of the story is, stop complaining about such minuscule bugs. Coding games and developing games is NOT easy. Somethings take time to fix..  So please, give the game some patience and all the kinks will be worked out. You can not rush perfection. Let the developers DEVELOP the game.. 


EDIT*: Some of your are disagreeing with what i am saying and responding with things such as ""How about EPIC test the patch before releasing it?""

Its great shooting someone 5 times with a tac because they have full shield, i'd be faster just shooting them with an AR.

Honestly its so annoying, everyone always has shields. You tap them with an AR they build and pop mini's straight away. The only way you can close a fight is pushing and running in with a pump and hope the shotgun RNG is in you're favour.

It's annoying that most fights come down to a shotgun fight. ARs seem to be just for opening and making them waste some of their unlimited small shields. ",FortNiteBR

Sure there are balancing issues with some of them and others are exploited (my ass hurts from getting DPed a bunch but that’s another thread).

The issue I want to address and I am sure many others have, is that there seems (to me) to be way too many rockets in game endings. Getting spammed by one guy with 30 rockets is not only annoying and frustrating, it’s unfair. I am not a good player, I am aware of this. The unfairness I’m talking about is things like when it’s 1v1 and the guy can be with in point blank range and rocket the ground and just kill you. I feel that it should come to a point that the RPG shouldn’t be intended as a main weapon in the end game, but more as a tool that should be utilized carefully. 

My suggestions are any of the following: increase RPG reload time; decrease rocket carrying capacity to something like 10 maybe - we can’t carry more than 10 grenades per slot, no idea if there’s a limit to boogie bombs etc, but a rocket is arguably more useful than all of those; decrease rocket ammo spawns - i already rarely find the RPG itself, no reason to change that, but watching streamers get to the end of the game with 50+ rockets tells you how much of it gets to the end. I’d like to discuss this. Thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

The storm speed and SMG's are crap. No one wants them.,"I find myself running to multiple buildings finding only ammo. It seems pretty BS that luck plays such a huge role in the game. I shouldn't land, run to every point of spawn and find only ammo. Instead of bringing out patches that ruin the look of the game focus on the content and scaling. Get rid of the shitty SMG's as well. No one likes them and they remove the likelyhood of something else, anything else being there.

The zone and the weapon spawns are completely luck based. 8 minutes without a gun of any kind is an absolute joke. Don't be lazy and spread out the loot. Remove the tendency for only ammo to be there.

The zone should not move much faster than a player can run, when spawning across the map from the circle you spend 80% of the game running in a single direction. Where is the fun in that? At least battlegrounds has transport.... Maybe increase the jump pad spawning outside the circle? 

Also you should have thought about all this already...... Smg's are the most hated weapon. Probably time to get rid. 

Bonus games shouldn't be an every 2 month thing, they are fun and you seem incredibly lazy at rolling out bonus game modes. 10v10v10v10v10v10v10v10v10v10 hasn't happened yet for some reason. I assume it's because EPIC games spend to much time on the look of the game. Now all green weapons look grey at night. Also you can now barely see balloons. Ruining what was good.

-Went full from 200 to 0 real quick. 3 second hitch with no frame drop dumped all his AR rounds on me at once which felt like a 2,000 damage crit.

-Tried to build walls. The server don't care. His bullets ate me alive while I aggressively spam my trigger so fast the return spring is giving way.

-While ramp rushing for victory my ramp decided to rotate and clotheslined me. I tried to make another ramp. I was too fast. Flat plat aka the plate I served him victory on. In what felt like a heartbeat he double pumped me 6x.

-While dropping after dealing with several frame drops and hitches after leaving the bus as the map slowly loaded below me I thought I saw a pistol on the roof. It was bandages. Love the new look of the loot. I got double pumped. Back to the lobby.

It seems like people kill me right away after they down me nowadays, and I feel like that never used to happen. 

Plenty of times I get downed and they rush me right away, completely ignoring my teammates. They'll finish me and then get melted by my teammates. 

I feel like it's better to leave someone downed and focus on their teammates because a downed person can't kill you, but their angry teammates will.

The only exceptions I can think are if you are out and need the downed persons ammo/resources, or if you have ample time to kill them and aren't in a fight with their teammates, or if you heard me shooting you with a SCAR/RPG/Sniper that will immediately help you win the fight against my teammates. 

It doesn't make sense to me, if you down a guy in squads and his 3 teammates are close by you can just kill their teammates and then the downed guy will pop anyways and give you all his goodies + his buddies goodies. 

It just doesn't make sense to me why 7/10 times I go downed and finished immediately, only to have my squad kill you right after you finish me off. Kamikazes, WWII was 80 years ago no need for this.

Been really enjoying Fortnite's BR lately!  It's lots of fun and I recommend it to anyone that's interested in the BR scene.

I like to challenge myself and set personal goals when I play these types of games.  On this particular run, I was lucky enough to snag a **29 kill solo game win** this does currently satisfy a world record for most solo kills in a single game.

Thanks to everyone who supports me and supports this game.  I hope you enjoy the run as much as I did.

I’m a casual fortnite player, and while I do consider fortnite as one of my favorite games, I do not have the financial capability to pay for skins as I’m a college student who’s already financially struggling. I don’t mind because Epic allows us to all have an equal playing field no matter the cosmetics, which I greatly appreciate.

However, considering I am not able to buy skins, someone went on my account and purchased (4) $99.99 V-Bucks. Meaning a total of $399.96 was charged onto my account. I emailed Epic approximately 8 days ago and requested them to take away anything that was purchased and refund the charges, but I have not received any updates to this case. So if any members of Epic games see this, please, please help me expedite this process, as I am in dire need of getting my money back.

Thank you so much.

And another thing- I think this person transferred the vbucks to their account, because I have 0 vbucks on my account. If Epic could track this person, it could stop someone else from being put in my position.",FortNiteBR

How many times have you hit for 90, 65, or 9? When you opponent turns around and hits you for 120 and your dead. I know most of you just say “aim better” but I’ve been in battles where we both headshot each other but he’s given better damage, it seems completely based on luck. I’m personally in a pickle, I don’t want to use shotguns because of how inconsistent they are but the fact that they have a chance at a 1 hit kill immediately make them better then the SMG’s and pistols because of their bloom. 

.




Solution: Make a shotgun headshot max out around 75-99, it should be a one hit kill, but also do something about this 9 damage nonsense. Ideally the range for a weapon shouldn’t be 9-120, but more like 50-99.

The basis of the idea is it takes up and inventory spot just like anything else, and while equipped, your character would hold an umbrella above their head, and while in the storm, the umbrella would take damage rather than yourself. 

I came up with 3 tiers for it. 

Rare Umbrella (blue): 30 HP

Epic Umbrella (purple): 40 HP

Legendary Umbrella (Gold): 50 HP

I think it could have some decent uses. Obvious one would be to use it as the storm is coming to be able to hang around a bit longer and loot, or maybe to pull off a flank route by going through the storm that could catch someone off guard. 

You also wouldn’t be able to fight while holding it, and you’d have to put away your umbrella to pull out your weapon. 

Also each umbrella would have a set amount of health (tiers listed above) and once the health of the umbrella is gone it immediately destroys itself and you start taking damage again, and once dropped from your inventory would not be able to be picked up by other players, unless it has some health remaining. 

What are you guys thoughts? Could it work? Would it be too strong/weak?",FortNiteBR

I have one major complaint and suggestion for any EG developer possibly reading this. Could you make it easier for some of us to earn the skins in the store? I’m not saying too easy but I, myself, can not afford to spend extra money on the skins that are in game. 

I understand that this is a major way that EG makes money off of FBR but maybe give us some V-Bucks at certain levels or so? I’m level 36~37 and have only 100 V-Bucks which makes it nearly impossible to get in-store items.

My suggestion is that we can either earn V-Bucks by:

1) Level-Up (maybe every 10 levels or so could be approximately 250-500 V-Bucks)
2) After completing “x amount” of objectives while in-game

I figured I would put that out there and see if people had the same opinion.",FortNiteBR

1: Then I’d have 2 guns using the same ammo (obviously doesn’t matter... USUALLY... late game. 
2: More damage long range and I consider myself pretty good with snipers after putting a good bit of time in with them

With shotguns being the best overall weapon in the game and being a solid builder maybe take the scoped over the regular AR but not a scar. Since any close-medium range I can build and close the gap to shotty them in the face. 

Just curious if you’re guys opinions! If the scoped has no bullet drop I can see myself using it a little more but still not sure. ",FortNiteBR

A pouch you could find (maybe supply drop only?) would give the user a tactical advantage over his enemeys in a non op way. You could maybe apply it like a bush and when you die, you dropp it.

But after consistent updates bugs came and the bugs never got fixed and people left. After bugs killed its population many people left again after shotguns became the only used gun! Does this sound familiar? H1z1 is dead now. Fortnite is making the same mistakes, like the updates are nice an fluid but the previous bugs are not fixed and every patch adds more. PLUS. NOBODY LIKES THE FACT THE ONLY GUN USED IN FORTNITE IS PUMPS. The pumps should not be able to wipe a full health player + shield. ESPICALLY if “Double Pump” is in 90% of people’s inventory. Plus when I say I only ever see pumps, I mean that people that are decent and know how to place theirselves much prefer to carry pumps around than snipers; or other high risk weapons since the pump has way much higher one shot kill potential than all other guns.",FortNiteBR

A little context... I am a 30+ male married with kids and a great job but still crush this game late night. I sometimes want to screen shot my stats and send them to friends/cousins/brothers, but I don’t because I don’t want them to see how much playtime I have racked up. We could all feel better about our stats if we didn’t have to feel the guilt of the ridiculous playtime that we have put in.

Business reason for removing it... Players will play longer if they don’t have that hugely embarrassing time played stat staring us in the face in the main menu. When I see that stat sometimes I want to throw up thinking about what else I could have been doing with that time instead...

So instead of fighting in the comments I would like to know this: 
-what do you think counts as BM in fortnite, 
 
-how often does it happen to you and how often do you do it,  

-when (if ever) do you think it’s justified, 

-and if you do it, why?

I know this has been mentioned multiple times in comments, but a post for it is definitely needed.  I can honestly say, a ""operation health"" type Stoppage of adding new content and fixing what is already there is in dire need.

We need the bugs first guys.

Roofs in Lodge? Broken again.

Building? still not snappy.

Guns still disappearing? still a thing

Colors are bland and washy again.

PS4 pro Framerate uncap is not what it used to be. (im scared to go home and try it later)

the big bug list is large. i could list at least 20, but this is not what this post is about. We do not need an update EVERY week.  how about 1 a month.  Fix bugs, go from there.

Please epic.  From a Super dedicated player, to you, fix whats broke first.  I know you guys listen, Please hear what I am saying.

I used to make Fifa content until the game became absolutely horrendous and unplayable. Now I make videos about stuff I enjoy and I currently really enjoy Fortnite. I am by no means a pro but I think I can help people with these tutorials. A lot of tutorials on YouTube are long with minimal useful information. From a YouTuber perspective, this is because people want to be first on search engine and they want longer view times so they can run more ads. This usually means sacrificing the quality of the video. I hope to make effective lessons on topics like; how to land quickly and effectively, 1v1 engagements, map movements and awareness, building, sniping, etc … Here is an example of what a lesson would look like:


&amp;nbsp;


**Lesson 1 – Everything You Need To Know About Landing**


&amp;nbsp;


**1. KNOW THE CHEST LOCATIONS.** The first and most important thing you need to know about landing is where the chests are located. This is your best way to get quality items and give yourself the best chance to survive the early game. /u/KevinSpicyy (great username) has blessed us with this [map]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7t7t9v/all_chest_locations_on_new_map/) that shows all the *possible* chest locations on the map. I strongly recommend printing this out and keeping it around you. It will also come handy later when we talk about map awareness and movement.


&amp;nbsp;


**2. UNDERSTAND POPULAR LOCATIONS.** Once the game has officially started and the bus is moving, you need to understand the risk/reward and your comfort level in the location you have chosen to land at. I have created this [map](https://imgur.com/oT1ULkJ) as an example of a typical game.
As you can see, named areas closest to the bus path will usually have the most people. If you are uncomfortable with a lot of people at the start, try a less crowded spot. Keep in mind that the further you go towards the outskirts of the map, the more likely you’ll be outside the circle or really far from the circle. There are many places on the map that have great loot and offer much less risk [map of no name places with probability of less people]( https://imgur.com/2ercqag). If you have been to a certain area before, for example: the prison, you’ll get to know where all the loot is, how to effectively move around that area and where potential enemies could be coming from. Lastly, the longer you wait to jump, the less people will be left on the bus. This means areas towards the end of the bus path will probably have less people. 


&amp;nbsp;


**3. LANDING TECHNIQUES.** Ok now that we’ve talked about understanding the map, let’s talk about how to actually land. Mark a spot on your map where you want to land and be aware of where the bus is at all times. You want to jump out at the earliest time possible that will allow you to glide directly to your exact location. Quickest way to the bottom is to nose dive to the lowest altitude. You’re parachute will auto deploy at a certain height, so that means if you nose dive onto a mountain your parachute will open sooner than someone that nose dove into a river. This took me a few hours but I managed to get 3 similar bus flight paths and try different approaches to the same spot (in this case it’s on top of the middle building at Supply Depo) (Video in comments below). One of the jumps is overshot and I’m left hanging in the air waiting for the parachute to come down. This is not ideal as someone could have jumped out earlier and already landed on the spot that I wanted to go to. One of the jumps is undershoot and I have to run to the desired point. This is also not ideal as someone could have landed right in front of me if they jumped out later or deployed their parachute slightly earlier. One jump is timed really well as I land right on the spot I wanted to. It’ll take some practice before you figure out the perfect timing but you should always be one of the first to land in your desired location if you understand the basics. Don’t be afraid to change spots if you see someone already landing at your location before you. Do a quick 360 turn before you land to see where your enemies have landed and where you can go next.


&amp;nbsp;


So this has been an example of the kind of lessons I’d like to do. I originally wanted to make these for my friends because they aren’t great at the game and I want more of them to play with me. I thought I’d put in more effort and share this information with other people that might find it useful. If I have missed anything, feel free to let me know in the comments. Would love feedback from experienced players as I’m always looking to improve my game as well.

If you're gonna report a bug, use the damn megathread first of all so that epic actually has a chance to see it.

But secondly, it's only been like 3 hours since the update went live. There are gonna be bugs, but stop freaking out and just calmly report them to Epic so they can be recognized and fixed.

Seems like so many people fail to realize how complex it is to make a game, and that bugs can and will arise from the smallest little misstep. They aren't wizards, they're people. They have a great track record of fixing bugs so let's give them more than a handful of hours to do so before we try to kickstart a riot for goodness sake.

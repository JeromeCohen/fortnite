As a 3rd party dev I have a lot of ideas that would help the community in general and the competitive scene specifically, but I can't implement any of these ideas because data isn't publicly available.

Things such as specific game meta data, specific player meta data, map meta data and more is missing. Making applications that would help solo snipes, custom rankings, and players get better isn't possible because there's no API for the Fortnite data.

It would be great to get a push going to get something that would help 3rd party developers make more than just another stat tracking website (which aren't even that robust).",FortniteCompetitive

Patch after patch, Epic are adding items that supposedly ""counters"" the building meta. However, all it does is encourage spam building. What do you do when you have C4s/minigun fire raining down on you? You try to build as many structures between you and the enemy to avoid damage. It's simple as that! 

What I think Epic didn't account for, was that whilst these new wave ""building busters"" that they released does do a good job against structures, they are way too good at exhausting the enemy's resources. Ramping up against an opponent with a grenade launcher is simply too costly to be effective, when one nade is enough to knock down your double wall + ramp. That is already at least 80 mats gone if you went two tiles up. They can do that 6 times per clip without peeking out of cover at all.

If another enemy team engages you right after a fight with someone decent, you are going to be dead more often than not if they are carrying splodes/minigun even if the enemy team is not as skillful as you. Let's say you have 300/100/100 mats after a build fight (which is actually normally what I have left after running into a strong opponent in mid game), you are going to be using at least 200 of that defending against the first wave splodes spam. Then you rebuild after a few AR/drum gun barrages, you pretty much have nothing left to fight with.

Like it's fair enough if you want to give players who can't build a chance (not something I agree with), but carrying splodes alone should not exhaust that much of your opponent's resources to the point where you are basically handed the fight on a plant (especially considering how easy and spammable they are). A buff in mats is needed to balance things out.

I’ve been playing since season 1 and have grown rather comfortable with the building aspect of the game but I feel like the primary thing holding me back is poor aim.

My pc (old, not custom) can usually run at 60 FPS on the lowest settings with a resolution of 1027 x 642. My mouse spins out sometimes, and my mousepad feels too small for my current sensitivity which I’m comfortable with (1600 DPI 0.07 in game). No matter what practice I put in, I feel that my aim just isn’t improving and is very inconsistent.

I was wondering if upgrading the mouse and pad would give me much more room for improvmemt or if my pc is really holding me back.

The simple fact that shooting 33% on threes is the same as 50% on 2's has largely eliminated the worst shot in basketball (long 2's) for all but the most elite players in basketball. This simple math took more than 2 decades after the introduction of three-day point line to be accepted. So what I'm saying is those who are interested and good at math should stay ahead of the curve.

Fortnite as a pop culture phenomenon, with so many streamers and good players competing has a huge sample size in which to record data, and while most strats can be attained simply by playing enough, new ones seem to pop up every week, especially after new updates. TFue and Cloak are so much ahead of other players, but if we could deduce what the best players do with empirical evidence, the ceiling for what players can do is infinite. BRs seem to be more predictable than irl sports since everyone is on the same playing field and things such as genetics don't play as much of a factor in one's ability.

Proposal: Analytics must encompass every part of a game(e.g. Basketball analytics=shooting, drafting, free agent signings, offensive/defensive schemes). So what does this mean for Fortnite? Analytics must encompass every facet of the game that can have data.

Where to Drop: record the first area players drop, materials collected before rotation, kills, and loot in conjunction with the path of the bus. 

Rotations: Record coordinates of first circle, enemies encountered on the way/at second area, number of kills, etc. This combined with the previous data could eventually give insight on how to encounter the most people given a certain bus.

Weapons: Taking a players accuracy with a certain weapon+the DPS could give data on their True DPS and possibly give insight on which weapons are best in certain situations that doesn't rely on ""feel"" alone. 

This all very basic, and the nuances of data collection still need to be sorted out. Someone who is better versed in Statistics would be much better than I for actual number crunching, but the idea to start is here.

I'm fine with the devs making the game easier, within reason, but to me it feels like good players are not being rewarded for putting in the time to get good at the game anymore. 

Epic has continuously altered the meta of the game, and to me it seems like the game was at its prime balance wise during season 3. Many of the adjustments made by Epic since then have very often been in favor of the casual playerbase, and stuff like material nerfs, hop rocks, weapon swap delays and explosive weapon buffs were not even asked for by a large majority of the community. 

I more often see streamers losing to players that are both statistically and performance-wise below the streamers skill level, because of stuff like C4, turbo building and so forth. I can't help but wonder what Epic is trying to achieve here? Are they not knowingly going down the same path as H1Z1 did, or are all of these changes eventually going to make everything feel like these many changes actually made sense?

I am asking because I under-perform in solo mode compared to duo/squads. When I played duo/squads exclusively, I am getting a weekly K/D in the range of 6-7s and a win rate of 35%-39%. I have held those statistics for a good half of the season at 50+ matches per week. I started playing a lot of solos the past 2 weeks because my mates are off for the summer, and my weekly K/D dropped to 3.12-3.5s with a winrate of only 17-19%.

I have no idea why there is such a difference in performance. It's not like I am getting carried in squads because my friends have similar stats and I can handle myself in 1v3-1v4s. The only reason I can think of is that I find solo boring. I'm used to team based FPS like CS:GO and A.V.A where there is a lot of communication and teamplay.

First, what resolutions would you recommend? I've tried 1600x900, 1440x1080, and 1280x1024, and they all feel very different. 

Second, is there a way to toy with the graphics settings to make it easier to spot people/things at distance? I think 1440x1080 was the worst with this, but they were all pretty bad.. Like to the point where if someone was maybe ~75 yards away with just their head peaking over a wall, I wouldn't be able to spot it. Not sure if I set something up wrong but yeah it was pretty bad at range.

And third, which is possibly the most important. I've noticed that when in stretched, if I do quick 90-180 degree turns like the ones you make when you jump and look behind you really quick mid-rotate, the game almost skips/drops frames or something. It's very noticeable despite running consistently at around 250-300 ish frames. Is there something I might be overlooking that is causing this?

Tfue/Cloak: 39

Sypher and Jaomock: 39

Svennoss and Tinny: 38

FunkBomb and Nateehill: 36

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does this mean? 

Basically, it shows that Tfue and Cloak are above most Fortnite Friday or NerdOut players by a good bit. They had 7 more kills on average then the next best team in the tournament AND they did it over more games (consistency!!). They also had 18 more kills per game on average than the other winners bracket semi-finalist. You can lump the other players into a huge group and they will trade spots and occasionally win or place high, but they won’t be able to keep up week after week with Tfue and Cloak.
 
That second tier is easy to spot, it’s the 23-28 kAVG range where most streamers, entertainers, players, etc. reside. This includes Sypher, Ninja, Vikkstar, Svennoss, Tennpo, SpaceLyon, etc. This tournament didn’t have the data for Myth and Hamlinz, but I have a feeling that they would be above this group, but still not on the same level as Tfue and Cloak. I’d like to see Fortnite Friday keep track of kills to make it easier to evaluate average kill per round numbers. 

Lastly, I would like to see more of FunkBomb and NateeHill, it’s hard to tell if they are incredibly good or if they had some good/lucky games. For now, they have the second-best average, but they were eliminated in one game in the loser’s bracket, so it’s hard to give them full credit for it.

Now I am not saying that EU players are better, we just won a lot easier that day on NA - so that's why I'm asking if anyone has more experience with playing on both EU and NA and maybe noticed a difference. If it was to be true, I could imagine that the NA playerbase is bigger and thus it is easier to get matched with less skilled players. ",FortniteCompetitive

Ever single round this tournament (so far, finals are still happening) has been a 2-0 win. In general the team that has the lead after the first game ends up winning the round. This way we would see more exciting game threes, people wouldn’t resort to lame tactics like following the other team to prevent them from getting kills, and people supporting the losing team won’t mentally check out when they’re down, increasing viewership. This format is too RNG to essentially have the entire round hinge on one game. (As I stated statistically speaking the player who had round 1 advantage has a near 100% chance of winning be round)

A common concern is that games would be too long (at least longer) than the current format. The great thing about this proposed format is that once the other team dies and has less kills, the other team can quit out of the game and the next game or round can continue.

Also losers bracket can be one game if necessary as you have more chances to move on/keep t close in the winners bracket",FortniteCompetitive

I played very little in Season 2 (could aim simply from 3,000+ hours of CS:GO and competitive e-sports in that franchise, but couldn't build.)

Lately, within the past month probably I've began to actually take the game serious and I'd say I'm a decent player. Not great, but decent. Even before playground mode came out, I wasn't necessarily focused on winning, I was focused on improving both my game sense and my building. As of the past few weeks I've been doing a lot of solo duos, as well as playing with my friend in solo duos who's of equal skill level I'd say. Together we average about 18 kills a game, sometimes 20 or more.

My overall stats aren't the greatest as prior I wasn't serious, but within the past month I've bumped from an average K/D of like 1.3 up to a 3 just before the other day. My win % went from like a 3% to around 10%. 

Mind you, this is within 7 day stats but for starting half way through the season, am I making decent progress? My building is pretty solid as well, I win the majority of my build battles and I know when to reset.

TL;DR:
Started playing halfway through Season 4 and my K/D is around a 3 and my win percentage is around 10% usually. Is this decent for only getting into Fortnite not long ago?",FortniteCompetitive

Tfue typically carries C4, as do some others.  However, I rarely see pro players opting to carry RPGs or GLs over double shotgun, double heals, even like Tac SMG AND Drum Gun.

It doesn't really add up.  I figure the answer is that professional players specifically are more *effective* with, say, double shotgun, but that doesn't add up to splodes being OP.  It simply means that splodes are too good for how easy they are to use, which is very different than being objectively overpowered.  I almost *never* see the best players in the world pick up even a gold RPG, even if they have a green Drum Gun in their loadout, and yet they whine incessantly (as do many people) about the splode buff.

In my personal opinion, I think they’ve done a bit too much to these weapons though. 2 well placed pistol shots can drop you 160 hp in a tenth of a second.

I love the accuracy on the MP5 but think they may have given it a bit much damage. Tommy Gun is great as well but think it could use slight damage nerfs. It does the same damage as a white burst AR after all with a fully automatic 50 round drum mag.

I think the actual system about Stats are pretty bad. Most people care about KD but it shouldn't be like this. Kills is a game is something that someone can just steal your kills or you have a pretty bad game and you can't finish anyone. So that's why I think ADG (Average Damage per Game). this option exists in View Match Stats that is the Damage you gave in that game and this should be the most important Stat and not KD. Damage can't be stolen by anyone and you can make a 0 kill game but give damage to many people. this is used in many Battle Royale games and it should be used as well on Fortnite.

The gun really favours pressuring your enemies to build and even countering shotgun in close combat fights. 

The unique horizontal recoil is acceptable, seems to be purposely designed so players won't use it for long range, hence the absent of FSA. 

I also realized LMG are rarely being used now ever since the Drum Gun been added. The comparison between the gun on how efficient they are is just a landslide. 

LMG's recoil is just insane, reload time too long, ammo is too large (even used like a disposal gun, where it is only going to be used one time before the ammo runs out). Reloading it is just a waste too.

What matters IMO is how well you can play in the current competitive format, and how often you can win when it matters during tourneys/ scrims. 

For example, there seems to be a general opinion among people that Hamlinz is the only one in TSM who hasn't fallen off. I watch Twitch daily for hours and that does not look like the case to me what so ever. Myth put it best in one of his streams, we will know who the best player is by the end of 2019 when we know who has the most tournament/competitive earnings.

First off, Ninja is one of three streamers I watch for Fortnite game play, so this discussion isn't meant to bash on Ninja. He states that he doesn't like how 1v1s are set up in playground mode due to no one shooting out each others build? His reasoning doesn't sound legitimate and comes off as an excuse to not lose matches versus other streamers. Ninja is no doubt a pro level player, but I feel other top tier players that may not be as good, catch up to his level and surpass him. I only can see positives out of versing other streamers and testing out new strategies.

We've all seen and experienced bloom fucking us over in certain situations. The front page literally has a post about shit bloom everyday. However, the bloom is consistent, and shots usually land where they should. Fortnite without bloom would make having high ground an insane advantage, while also causing many more incidences of ""lasering"" people from 100 metres. Different guns have different roles; a shotgun or smg should be used up close, an ar should be used at ranges of 30-125m, and a sniper/scoped rifle should be used for anything further. The aim part of this game is balanced based off everyone having bloom and everyone having the tools to work around it. Bloom is only really an issue with headshots, as a lucky headshot can determine a fight. Bloom in the majority of cases is not determining a fight, unless the two fighting are literally just on the ground and ar spamming each other without building. Every player has the tools to work around bloom, and shots can still accurately hit at a range where the AR excels.

I would say the addition of first shot accuracy is enough for this game

I'd like to hear some of your opinions on bloom and have a discussion

As of right now there are two main sections that fortnite competitions fall into: 

1. 2v2s where whichever group has the most kills wins

There have been multiple tournaments in this format, and while entertaining, I personally believe they aren’t a good base for a competitive esport scene. They are extremely luck and RNG dependent, relying on random players to provide a scoring system. One team might perfectly run into a bunch of easy kills one after another while the other gets attacked by multiple well organized teams that draw out the fights for a long time. 

2. Custom matches where everyone in game is competing. There have been a lot fewer of these, but I believe they are a much better and more fair assessment of skill for a competitive environment. Its a regular game, just one where everyone is trying their hardest to win. There are still a lot of problems with it unfortunately. Even though these matches often have less players than a normal game, commentators and camera operators seem to have a lot of issues placing the camera where it needs to be at important times, often not even having a replay of what happened to a fan favorite (seeing myth die to fall damage from the kill feed instead of being able to see a replay of it). This is a big issue and hurts the enjoyment of spectating a “professional” event. If i might as well just be watching a regular stream of that single player, why even pay someone to operate the camera

The Future

With the recent release of playground mode, many players first reaction is setting up 1v1s and 2v2s. Personally I think this is the best bet for an actual competitive scene. No need for a camera on 70+ people, no reliance on randoms from public games, just two people/teams fighting it out. 

There are many different implementations of this that can happen, ranging from there being a specific 1v1 map made by epic, to players being able to choose a loadout before spawning into a specific section of the map with the storm already closed in. 

Whats your opinion/hopes? Am I an idiot and the “compete for most kills” method is obviously the best thing for a competitive scene? Are 1v1s a stupid idea? ",FortniteCompetitive

But for actually training or improving it's lacking a few things that I'd like epic to consider

1. Spawn with full shields: simply put it you're doing constant battles it's very hard to have enough shields to keep it fair, especially big shields, this would level the playing field 

2. Loot doesn't drop. I don't know why this isn't already in the playground but it's extremely annoying doing 1v1s and having to pick your stuff up Everytime you die, especially since most of your deaths would be in build battle towers

3. Can't edit other players structures. 

4. Unlikely this one would ever be implemented but it would be awesome if structures that haven't been built on or edited in the past 5 minutes would break so that the map isn't cluttered with massive battles

5. Chests respawn after 10 minutes so you don't have to spend half of the hour looting different places

If you have any more suggestions feel free to put them in, this is just my opinion after 3 hours of training.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Quick tips:

1. HOLD THE TURBO BUILD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BUILD!!
2. LOOK downwards a bit before you start. This allows the under ramp to be built
3. Timing is crucial when you execute the FLOOR to WALL to RAMP (FWRAP), it has to be done fast enough so you dont phaze through your ramp and not too early

* The Drum Gun is a hybrid weapon that combines the stopping power of a rifle with the suppressive ability and fire rate of an SMG.  
* Available in Uncommon and Rare variants.
* 26/27 base damage.
* 50 round capacity.
* Uses Medium Ammo.
* Can be found from floor loot, chests, and Vending Machines.

The Uncommon variant has 26 damage and the Rare has 27, both with 9 fire rate, for a total of 234 and 243 DPS (values similiar to the Tactical SMG), respectively.What's your thoughts on the weapon? How will it change the current meta? Maybe people will start using Drum Gun as AR (instead of the Suppressed SMG) and a Tactial SMG for close range fights? ",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve seen a few tweets from multiple pro players/streamers and how everyone wants the old shotguns back, and I tend to agree. I’d just like to hear what the general community thinks about the current state of shotguns. 

*My personal opinion* - I think the recent nerf was overboard, and being able to one shot should be a thing, especially with buffs to other weapons (SMGs). My ideal changes would be to revert the changes to structures or at least tweak them to make it a big easier to break walls with shotguns in general. Revert the damage changes, and maybe tweak the pump pull out time slightly to make it a big faster. 

Like I said I just wanted to hear some other opinions and what the general consensus is about shotguns in the current meta.",FortniteCompetitive

Xim allows MnK to emulate a controller, so fortnite still thinks you are using a controller and therefore you still have to use builder pro (equivalent of Circle (binded to my mouse) to open the building menu, left click for wall, right click for stairs, Q for pyramids, E for floors). Still have to hold equiv of circle to edit, its not instant like on PC. 

Still have to use the equivalent of L1 and R1 (Q and E for me) to change weapons so cant go from weapon 1 to weapon 4 instantly.

For those 2 reasons above is why I am saying Xim does not have a building or weapon switching advantage over controllers

Only advantage is aim- once you find a good sensitivity you can hit a lot more shots (especially shotgun) while still having quite a high sensitivity which can help with building

I dont think people using Xims is such a big issue as people make it out

Usually you wouldn't really care if you had them and using them in build fights did not really help. All you could do with them was trap bots in 1x1, but now traps are really useful. I think like 30-40% of my build fights end with me getting a kill using traps.  

Different uses: 
1) The trap glitch - someones turtling in a 1x1 you break the floor above him replace the floor and then spam the spike traps. It still isn't fixed and it is really strong.. It puts one trap ontop of the 1x1 and one inside. 
2) When someone ramps over you - When someone ramps over you, you just quickly place a pyramid ontop of the player and then 3 floors around followed up with a trap or 2 to get a quick and easy kill. That works on even really good players if you do it quick enough. Only way to escape it is to edit the ramp down really fast or just start AR spamming the pyramid as soon as someone places that over you.
3) When you ramp over someone - Sometimes in a buildfight when someone edits himself out of a 1x1 and you put a ramp over him, he gets stuck between his building and your ramp. Then you follow it up with 3 floors and a trap getting you another easy kill.
4) When you want to turtle - Also while turtling putting a trap in your 1x1 can save your life quite often. When someone is AR spamming from above trying to jump into your 1x1 or if you edit someone inside to get the kill on him.

I probably missed alot of instances where traps could be used but, I really feel like traps should stay the way they are. I always get excited when I see traps laying around.. Before I had 17 of them a game and didn't really bother to use them. Even if you take a look at Martoz and his new scrim video alot of the kills he gets are thanks to smart use of traps. Another example could be when SypherPK trapped Camills getting him an easy kill aswell. People were giving Camills alot of shit for that..

Now is my time to showcase my findings from the silenced SMG after its godly buff. I will break this into pro's and cons, then write a small paragraph about it.

Pros:

Great Damage

Incredible Accuracy

Amazing Firerate

Astounding Versatility in a setup

Often forgotten, but the gun is in fact silenced (wow who would've guessed??)

Cons:

Sucks at breaking structures.

Doesn't always give the damage you would receive or like in a quick peak fight if you were to be using an AR instead .

After running the silenced SMG in place of an AR for most of today, and using it in place of a burst weapon most of the update, I have found that this weapon is incredibly versatile and can be used in tons of situations. I only found myself in a deficit a handful of times, when me and another player were base camping and trying to quick peak eachother, and there was a bit too much ground between us to have a successful rush without putting yourself at serious risk. I also found that  when you are against a player who is ramping too early, breaking the base of their structure can take a bit too long. However, it certainly has earned a spot in my setup. You guys all know and have seen the accuracy and the damage, but one thing I haven't noticed people talking about, is the usefulness of the silence in medium to long range combat. A situation I was in just a single game ago, was when an omega was pushing to the zone, and was being sniped at by the other player left. (3 alive currently). He was pushing closer to my base, but hadn't seen me. I peak out, and laser him. I was confused when he didn't block off my side and kept running at me. I then peaked again and finished him off. I watched again in replay mode, and from first person in his perspective, you cannot hear the bullets at all. He assumed the player that was sniping him had hit a lucky shot, and never even noticed me. I overlooked this feature, as it has never really been talked about. Overall, this gun is incredible, and can take the place of any weapon besides a sniper IMO.",FortniteCompetitive

I tried dual barretas but I can't find a good spot for them in my inv. They can't replace shotguns due to the very slow reload time, ROF and the inconsistency with them being burst. They cant replace M4s due to them having a shorter viable range which means I only found them 'okay' as a secondary to the shotgun but even then I sometimes may just throw them for a sniper rifle as I find that much useful.

They should be an interesting team considering that they both play a hyper aggressive style and basically land Tilted every game.

From watching my VODs, I've noticed a few bad habits I have are:

\- I often get flustered when build battling good players, often getting stuck underneath and completely disengaging.(still somewhat getting used to keybinds and the pace)

\- I take fights I probably shouldn't, I'm probably over aggressive at times

\- I die a lot in the early game, my shotgun aim could definitely use work

\- I bunny hop a lot in fights, to the point i get 'stuck in the mud' often (PC Overwatch habit, mashing space bar)

\- If i get pinched or 3rd partied I struggle to disengage

I watched Ninja and realised how much I had to learn which was exciting.

Fast forward to now, I’m battle pass 100 and level 95 in season 4. I have over 500 wins and a 6KD which for me is alright. 

But the problem is I find myself getting tilted so easy now. When I die to a good player I accept that I was outplayed and move on but I feel like I’m getting tilted with the amount of inconsistencies in the game and in the end I just decide I won’t play which sucks as this is my favourite game and I want to play it.

I’m struggling for motivation with solo queue as everyone is getting decent, fights take longer, mats take longer to farm and in the end I get a little #1 banner for my efforts but I like the killing aspect so I play for kills. It’s just a shame I seem to spend 80% of my games bouncing around trying to find someone to fight due to the first circle having 40 people left before it even finishes closing.

Basically, TLDR I find myself getting tilted with things that never used to tilt me and I can’t seem to find motivation to play solos any more. My friends all quit to go play Realm Royale but I want to play fortnite. 

Any advice? ",FortniteCompetitive

361,ToM_ttv,1530326387,8uytw9,47,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8uytw9/how_can_people_call_ninja_best_player_in_the/,0,How can people call Ninja best player in the world? Just look at this clip dumb decision slow building looks like a bot. It's mindblowing to me that some people consider this guy best in the world,,FortniteCompetitive
362,Wyleyb,1530320769,8uyacm,18,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8uyacm/ranked_mode_idea/,1,Ranked Mode Idea,"there has been a lot of different people trying to think of a competitive way to have a ranked playlist for people to que for in fortnite. i spent a strong amount of time trying to think of the most competitive way it could be done and wanted to send my idea to you guys and see what you think.

the type of system that i think would work the best for a battle royal type of game is a ""Based Line System"". the way it would work is every team that ques for this playlist would have to earn X amount of points (lets say 30) from both kills (1 kill = 3 points) and where you placed in the match ""survival"". break the match up into 4 different brackets. your top 25,50,75, and 100. if you die within the 76-100 zone you are awarded no points. if you die within the 51-75 you are awarded 5 points. if you die 26-50 you are awarded 10 points, and the top 25 players finished will be awarded 15 points. now on top of that you would also award additional points based on where you placed in said bracket. so lets say 2 players finish in the top 25 brackets, both players are given 15 points for that. but one player died as #24""lets say +3 bonus points"" while one finished the game as #1. the player that finished as #1""lets say +12"" would get more bonus points for finishing higher in their said bracket. (input numbers for each other player inside each bracket). now because its a ranked game type you would need to be able to rank up and rank down based off performance. so if the base line is 30. any player that doesnt meet that base line will be counted as a loss for that match, and will derank ""-10 points for a loss"" but any player that meets the base line will go up. ""+20 points per win"" giving players a chance to progress in case they drop and instantly die. players that go well above the base line of 30, ""lets say gets 40 points from both kills+survival"" will be able to earn more than the standard +20 for a win. giving players an incentive to continue to try even after reaching the goal of 30. with this playlist there should also come ranks. IE ""bronze,silver,gold,plat,diamond,challenger,Top 500"". type of ranks. each rank would require X amount of points to go up. for example ( Bronze would be 0-200, Silver 201-400. and so on) so when you earn that amount of points youll rank up into the next division. there will be no point cap at the end. so the top 500 players would just be fighting for whoever can go the highest at that point. there would be 2 playlists. a solo que and a duo que. if playing with a teammate youll combine your total scores to = out at that base line. so if one of you gets 5 kills and the other gets 6 you would = out as an 11 kill total for your team. on the other hand, from the surviavl aspect. the score will only count for how high your team placed as a whole. so if one of you died in the top 50, and one of you died in the top 25, the one who placed higher ""top 25"" will be the bonus points your team will get, meaning that survival points do not stack.

now that was just how i would think the rank system would be based. i also believe there would need to be some balance changes for the ranked mode.

1. All players will spawn in the match with a Grey Tact-shotgun that has a total of 12 shots. (gun isnt strong enough to 1 shot a full health target, doesnt have the range to shoot people while they are still falling. but gives you a fighting chance so you no longer run into a house and die without a gun).

2.all players will spawn into the game with 30 wood.(could live without)

3.all players will spawn with 50 shield. ""so full health, 100. and half shields, 50"".

(lets say 6 players drop in one location, at least 3 of them will find mini shields. which can be an unfair advantage within the first 3 minutes of a match for the other 3 who didnt get any shields. allows a little bit more wiggle room from RNG).

4.the first circle will always drop in the center of the map, but also be big enough that you could reach it within the time limit no matter where you decided to drop on the map. after the first circle, you can go back to its RNG randomness for the rest. ( no more dropping risky but the first circle is at fatal. gives you a more controlled variable when youre deciding where you want to drop. also will make it where half the lobby wont drop and die within the first 3 minutes of the match. this will open up the whole map as a ""doable drop"".

5. no challenges are going to be doable to the ranked mode

The reasons for these balance changes is because a battle royal game (typically the first 3 minutes) has was too much randomness that can happen to you. these updates would give every player a fair fighting chance from the start of the match.

the numbers of course can be changed to build the best playlist around this style. it just needs a Base line point system. where you earn points on both kills and survival. with both a way to rank up and rank down.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;nbsp;

**Should I get a Scuff or Xbox One Elite Controller?**

Xbox One Elite is a great controller that I have used for quite some time. It is very easy to remap buttons as it has an options natively in the Xbox settings. I believe for scuf you can remap using the EMR key. Both controllers are highly reputable and whichever you choose will increase you gameplay. Although Xbox has more flexibility due to stick changing, removable paddles; I think Scuf is a reputable brand.

&amp;nbsp;

**Do I need a Scuff or Xbox One Elite Controller?**

Absolutely not. Both will help you improve your game but will only do so much. If you play CLAW the controllers will help even less. The most advantageous thing about the controllers if you play CLAW are the trigger stops and different stick configurations.

&amp;nbsp;

**What sensitivity should I play on**

Whatever feels the most comfortable for you. A good reference is having your sensitivity as high as you can while CONSISTENTLY hitting your shots.

&amp;nbsp;

**Should I switch to Builder Pro?**

Please for the love of god YES.

&amp;nbsp;

**Is keyboard and mouse on console fair?**

This an opinion but:

PS4: Yes, since everybody has a chance to use it

Xbox: No, since you have to buy a 3^rd party adapter

&amp;nbsp;

**Will there be pro scene for console?**

Epic hasn't announced one yet, but it is assumed if there is it won't be as big as the PC scene

&amp;nbsp;

**How can I find teamates?**

Use the official Fortnite [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fortnite). It has an LFG for all consoles where you can post your requirements you want in your team.

&amp;nbsp;

**Who are the best console players/streamers?**

**Xbox:**

Silenced SMG, yes, has a tighter spread now so theres a lot of talk about it being more accurate without bloom, and since it has a good fire rate, it ""melts"" people. However, I just can't seem to wrap my head around what you'd do at medium/long distance as the damage dropoff feels more significant on the s/ SMG than the AR. What do you think?

This is done presumable to save their wood because it's slightly more effective in fights due to higher initial HP and faster assembly. It will frequently lead, however, to mats looking like 999/0/0 and potentially leaving some wood when looting bodies, essentially reducing their max resources in many cases. Just now when watching said player, he was worried about running out of mats after following this pattern all game. 

So I've been wondering, is this trade-off really worth it? Or should one stick to always using wood first in order to maximize potential mat gain?

* 1600 x 1080
*  1440 x 1080

I am also seeing players scale down the HUD size to about 70 or so. To me, the HUD scaledown makes sense becaause it gives you a lot more room to focus on gameplay, aim, and spotting rather than having all corners of the screen be covered up by the HUD. 

***Furthermore, can anyone actually explain the advantages of resizing your resolution for Fortnite?*** I just did it and tested it for about 3-4 games. Things are a bit blurry in the distance but I did not test long enough to see if it helps.

-Pencil warriors sitting in a box, hidding and peaking through their wall with the edits.

The main problem with the new opaque editing is

-Unability to outplay your opponent by placing a structure on him, quickly editing it, seeing where he is, confirming the edit, and making your move. One the main cores of build fights is gone. 
Some are saying that having the editing is already an advantage, IT IS NOT. Right now, you place your wall, edit, can't see where your opponent is, meanwhile he can see through the wood and preaim you.

One of the solutions is: to let you see through tiles for a few meters away. But that solution won't correct the turtling is scrims and it will be hard to implement.

The best solution is to let tiles be clear for maybe 5 seconds after you place a wall down. That solution fixes all problems while keeping the ability to quickly place walls and edit them in built fights. Easy to implement.",FortniteCompetitive

If I edit a wall I just made, my opponent can just look through the wood wall (which is transparent since it's newly built) and see my quite clearly. On the other hand, I have to look through small cracks to see them since all the blocks become solid. This is problematic, it removes a lot of the advantage blocking your opponent with well placed structures gives you. 

The solution would be to have editing opacity scale upwards with how much the wall is built. So, a fully built wall will look like what we have now, but a newly built wall will look like what we had before the nerf. This way, camping is still countered because once your wall fully builds you won't be able to see through it at all any more, but quick edit plays are unaffected. You also wouldn't be able to circumvent this because too much if you quickly edit the wall and then reset it to get full opacity back, you're lowering your structure's health and giving away your position.",FortniteCompetitive

It now takes 3 pump shots to break a wooden wall (50 structural damage), so they are completely useless against structures. This means you can no longer throw your opponent's tempo off with a sudden one pump on their fresh wall after AR spamming. Nor can you interrupt your opponent's attempt to ramp up on you in a build fight before they place a wall in front. 

I feel like the damage nerf last patch already put shotguns in a good place. 

* The tac faced a headshot multiplier nerf, so a full head shot only does 134-148 damage. This limited it's use even further to close range fights. 

* The pump was nerfed the hardest. Without one hit kill ability, double pumping is now a preference rather than an unfair advantage like before. Landing your first shot is more important since your follow up shot cannot save you from the fight. 

* The heavy wasn't touched, and now remains the best shotgun in accordance with it's rarity. The only thing that needed tweeking was double heavy. 

I just don't think nerfing shotguns again is the right direction to encouraging weapon diversity. After the last nerf you could already see the playing field between SMG and shotguns evening out. ",FortniteCompetitive

His positioning and accuracy is top notch on console, while his sensitivity is ""only"" 6 5 and 0.5 &amp; 0.5 [(source)](https://clips.twitch.tv/BravePatientMelonPhilosoraptor).

Furthermore, I see a lot of people complaining on all his vids, not just this one, that the people he's facing are bots/noobs that don't build. Some guys even state that the players on the server he's playing are so bad because it's NA and not EU. I have a few different questions that hopefully lead to a discussion.

1. What do you think is more important, being able to build fast and suffer with aiming or have better aiming and therefore lower sensitivity?
2. Is the level of skill really that different from NA &amp; EU on console? Some guys state that the players they are facing are better than the players Nick is facing. Could it be that he just makes them look bad, but they are just as good as the players everyone is facing?

Sypher and ninja talked about it when playing today and ninja said it could actually speed up the tournament because as soon as you beat a team in kills that died early you could back out and start the next one as the match is won.

This could buffer some of the problem where going down early essentially loses you the round because the other team can simply stay alive and get a huge lead.

The whole video is worth the watch. The tl;dr is essentially, without an incentive to win all pro scrims, solo snipes etc. is very boring to play and watch. 

He proposed two specific things that he thought would change this:

* First, a point system something like the following - 1st = 100 pts, 2nd = 90, 3rd 80, etc. and 25 points per kill
* Second, have structures decay and break in the storm. This would prevent players from building gigantic multi-tiered structures, and stop endgames from consisting mostly of people sitting in bases with campfires &amp; medkits &amp; trying to see who lives the longest in the storm.

I think it's a great proposal. The first point is pretty much non-negotiable long term, I think. The only thing that I've watched competitively that's really been entertaining has been the friday fortnite tournaments, because you get to see the best of the best have to truly push themselves. I wish they could fight each other as well, and have incentive to do so, but it's the best, and it's because kills are incentivized.

It completely defeats the purpose of a ranked mode on consoles, most controller players  are just going to get steamrolled by any decent keyboarders.

It’s a shame that it was such a huge problem in Overwatch, and now it’s probably an even larger problem in Fortnite..

Microsoft claimed ages ago that they give developers the ability to block people using adapters, so why haven’t Epic done anything?

The high ground concept to get the shooting advantage on your opponent is crucial. I'm honestly okay with a pyramid blocking someone so you get another opportunity to regain high ground and I could see a nice meta spawning from that, however...  


The way the game used to work is if you boxed yourself in while your opponent held the high ground you were basically dead or at least in an unfavorable position you had to work your way out of. (Edit out, ramp above and below, turnaround 1x1 etc.)  


Now with the pyramid block your opponent takes high ground and gets trapped for 150 or more if they boxed you in all the way. I'm okay with a smarter meta where you have to make good decisions and be aware, but the counterplay to this seems to head towards a meta in which you have to keep high ground, but also cannot get too close to really enforce your advantage.

This will be a thought out, wrote up piece of things we are planning for the Fortnite Pro League. 

Earlier today [we announced](https://twitter.com/FPLnewsfeed/status/1011342834375458817) our staff which consists of a genius marketing and operations director with Paul Taylor, and two pro players with [Mystic](https://twitter.com/WBG_Mystic) and [Fuda](https://twitter.com/itsfuda). I also have a former EU Pro player helping me out named [Berg](https://twitter.com/lilBRG). If you’re from Twitter and reading this, you already know, but if you’re from Reddit and just know figuring out who we are, we just wanted to let you know that. Now, to the stuff you are actually wanting to know. 

# Announcing Kaysid as our NA Coordinator:

This was in the talks for some time but we wanted to make sure NRG didn’t have a problem with it. We’re super happy to announce that [Kaysid](https://twitter.com/KaysidFN) will be our NA Coordinator. Basically anything he can fill me in on, he will. I pretty much know all the intel that needs to be known so I have a trust with the players that I’m not just telling some random person it. Kaysid has been a huge help to me personally, and I couldn’t me more excited for his future in this game as a player. He's honestly a top 10 player.

# Announcing Fiery as our GFX

We announced a lot of staff today but held off from [Fiery](https://twitter.com/FieryFN) because we were sorting out the details. This kid is mean when it comes to edits, and with eSports being a hungry department for edits, we had to get who we think is the best guy out there. He will make our page/company look professional and presentable. 

# FPL 2v2 Showdown NA V1:

We formally announced our tournament to the Pro Players, but no we’re coming out and letting everybody in the community know that we are hosting a KEEMSTAR-like tournament for Pro/Legendary League players only. We definitely want to give back to the 1&amp;#37; of players who have fought hard to be that 1&amp;#37;. 

On June 30th, we will announce the first 16 captains and their team names, along with their seeds. Then later on we will surprisingly announce the other 16 teams. There will be 32 teams competing in the tournament. 

**We want to let everyone know that the prize pool will be split up 3 ways (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and will AT LEAST be 4 digits.** 

We will announce the ruleset on June 30th. Trust me, it’s unique and different, and **will be the go-to ruleset for Fortnite tournaments moving forward. We strongly believe that.** 

# Actively recruiting for FPL 2v2 Showdown EU V1 starts today:

Super happy to announce that we are actively recruiting 32 teams for the EU tournament. You must be a BP player. We are getting better and better everyday with the EU scene. That entire scene as been so good to us with communication. 

# June 30th

On June 30th, we will be announcing who the teams are and get ready for the countdown of the FPL 2v2 Showdown. We will also announce a date for the tournament. July will be the month of competitive Fortnite. 

# End goal and moving forward

Moving forward we have a bigger announcement on June 30th, but we wanted to let players know what we were up to right now. A few things:

* Announcing our ranking system/points system for tournaments 
* Announcing changes in the community (roster changes, org pick ups, team name changes)
* Keeping the FPL Board updated with Pro Discord and Pro Bush teams, as well as FA's. 
* Posting power rankings of teams, and players in the Discord. 

**Our entire End Goal is the most important thing to us as a company. It's what we think about every time we come up with an idea, or a strategy. Meshing the NA and EU scenes together to create the Fortnite Pro League is what our end goal is.** 

**We are super happy to announce that the Fortnite Pro League will be created, and strategized strictly around Squads, but we aren't straying away from Solo/Duo play. We are in talks with many organizations. But we need Epic's support and for them to contact us back. It's the last thing we need. The timeframe for Season 1 will be Fall 2018/Spring 2019.** ",FortniteCompetitive

Here’s my thoughts on how to accomplish that.

**Health &amp; Shields**
- Players spawn with 50 Shield on top of their initial 100 Health
- Players gain 50 Health &amp; 25 Shield as a reward each time they eliminate another player

*These settings will reward skilled players who win fights and help eliminate some of the random outcomes seen in early-game battles*

**Looting &amp; Farming**
- Chests spawn 100% of the time
- Floor Loot spawns 100% of the time
- Wood farming buffed 50%
- Brick farming buffed 25%
- Metal farming buffed 10%
- Chests and Floor Loot never spawn Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, or C4

*These settings will allow Players to spend less time looting and farming enabling them to get into more fights and help reduce random outcomes in battles*

**Supply Drops &amp; Loot Llamas**
- Supply Drops and Loot Llamas are marked on the Map making them visible to all Players
- 1-2 Supply Drops spawn after every Storm shrink
- Loot Llamas drop 1200 Materials with guaranteed Shields, Meds, C4, and a Launch Pad
- Supply Drops only drop Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, Scars, Heavy Shotguns, and Bolt Action Sniper Rifles with guaranteed Shields, Meds, C4, and a Launch Pad

*Supply Drops and Loot Llamas being a higher priority will force Players to either fight over them for the guaranteed rewards or avoid them for safety*

**Removed Weapons/Items**
- Clingers
- Mini-Gun
- Port-a-Fort
- Bush
- Any LTM Weapon/Item
- All Gray &amp; Green Rarity Guns
- Blue Tac SMG, Blue Bolt, Blue LMG, Blue Scoped AR
- All custom Skins including Back Bling, Gliders, Pick Axes, &amp; Contrails

*These Weapons/Items being removed from play will help keep the game purely skill based*

**Miscellaneous**
- Bloom nerfed 50%
- Fall Damage nerfed 50%
- Jump Stamina nerfed 50%
- 80 maximum Players

*This will allow for more skill based outcomes in fights*

——————————————————————

**Storm**
- The 1st Storm Circle is shown on the Map from the beginning
- There are only 7 Storm Circles
- Maximum Match Time is 23 minutes
- The first five Storm Circles are slightly smaller than their normal game mode counterparts
- The 6th Storm Circle is the size of the 7th Storm Circle seen in the normal game mode
- The 7th and Final Storm Circle is the size of the 8th Storm Circle seen in the normal game mode, but shrinks slowly

*These Storm Circles will allow players to make a more skill based decision as to where to land and help eliminate the mid-game slowness experienced in the normal game modes*

**Storm Times &amp; Damage**
- 1st Storm
    - 0:30 Delay Time
    - 2:30 Shrink Time
    - No Damage while shrinking
    - 0.5 Damage after shrinking
- 2nd Storm
    - 3:00 Delay Time
    - 2:00 Shrink Time
    - 0.5 Damage while shrinking
    - 1 Damage after shrinking
- 3rd Storm
    - 2:00 Delay Time
    - 2:00 Shrink Time
    - 1 Damage while shrinking
    - 2 Damage after shrinking
- 4th Storm
    - 2:00 Delay Time
    - 1:30 Shrink Time
    - 2 Damage while shrinking
    - 2 Damage after shrinking
- 5th Storm
    - 1:30 Delay Time
    - 1:00 Shrink Time
    - 2 Damage while shrinking
    - 5 Damage after shrinking
- 6th Storm
    - 1:00 Delay Time
    - 1:00 Shrink Time
    - 5 Damage while shrinking
    - 10 Damage after shrinking
- 7th Storm
    - 1:00 Delay Time
    - 2:00 Shrink Time
    - 10 Damage while shrinking
    - 10 Damage after shrinking

*These Storms will make for faster gameplay, allow Players to fight without taking massive Storm Damage early on, and give the surviving Players more time to battle in the Final Circle without worrying about taking Storm Damage*

**Scoring**
- Winners will be decided by a point system. Players receive one point per elimination (Elim-Points). An Elim-Point multiplier is given to players who place in the top 3 with additional points added after the multiplier depending on initial placement.

Elim-Points = 1 point per elimination
1st Place = Elim-Points x 5 + 16
2nd Place = Elim-Points x 3 + 7
3rd Place = Elim-Points x 2 + 1
4th-80th Place = Elim-Points x 1

*This point system rewards Players who can both win fights and make it to the end, will help discourage people from camping, and keeps the game both skill based and fun to spectate*",FortniteCompetitive

I would like too see a discussion about screen size, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate. I'll leave you with 2 questions.

1. What are you currently using and why?

What would you use if you had unlimited money and cared about the game exclusively (don't take in consideration streaming or your daily job. ^(Keep it viable, 4K 240Hz G-SYNC HDR isn't viable!))?

**Personally**

1. I've been using a 28 inches, 2560x1080 (Ultrawide 21:9) with 75 Hz and FreeSync. I don't care about the refresh rate and frame sync technology (I use a NVIDIA graphic card), I only bought this monitor because I'm studying computer science, so a bigger (and larger screen) is nice for programming.
2. I would probably buy a 32 inches, 2560x1440 (16:9) with 144 Hz (and G-Sync).",FortniteCompetitive

I am asking because I feel during some encounters the AA is a lot stickier than other times (e.g. out of range, looking through a window).

Is there any way to manipulate the Aim Assist mechanics or is it more or less just binary, it’s either on or off when a player is within range / near reticule? Is it stronger when ADSing or when hip firing? ",FortniteCompetitive

I don’t have an issue with building, shooting or any other game mechanic, the only issue I have is with map rotation, understanding where people will be from the bus line and finding people mid game.

I’ve tried looking at videos from Sypher and watching other streamers, and it has worked but not that well.

I play on the Xbox, my stats are here if you are curious:

I haven’t given it a shot yet because I know that I hate losing so going into a game with a very high chance of losing doesn’t have the highest appeal to me",FortniteCompetitive

It took me back to MW2 days when I would get online with my friends and just clown around and have fun. The beginning of Fortnite gave me awesome memories (and thrown controllers/mice).

I was talking to one of my buddies about the state of the game now, and he brought up a good point. Epic caters to the whiners and wanters.

Obviously there‚Äôs no problem in playing a game, reading a book, or watching a movie and wishing it had gone a different way, or someone would have not done what they did, etc. Everyone thinks these things, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs where the problem lies.

Games, along with other forms of media, are created FOR people. If there‚Äôs a skin on the battle pass that you don‚Äôt like, don‚Äôt buy the pass. If there‚Äôs a gun that sucks in game, don‚Äôt use it. Maybe i‚Äôm simplifying things, but it seems like Epic will change something in the game when the players, aka THIS SUB, whine about it. I think this game is dying, and it started to go when it became obsessed about what the players thought about it.

What if Rowling rewrote the series because too many people complained about dumbledore dying? What if Bethesda remade skyrim and made all the dragons two feet tall and bright pink because people thought they were cuter? Both of those things would suck. Maybe it‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration, but I think my point still stands. People will always complain about something, but when will the changes to this game stop? Fortnite isn‚Äôt getting better with constant changes. 

All i‚Äôm saying is if the cat woman gets her pony tail removed because some guy got a bunch of people to press an orange arrow at his photoshop job, Epic really is showing how little respect they have for themselves as a game maker. ",FortNiteBR

WTF, how does the patch suddenly become about QOL improvements like that? Explain! If and when it is released within the next 48 hours, then NO, absolutely not was it ever meant to be a QOL patch.

I‚Äôm not saying there should never be a time to thirst, maybe you need mats, or minis or something, but the standard nowadays is that the person that downs you will thirst you, even as the rest of your team pushes them. This makes squads and duos much less fun, and makes it so that there are always 5 or 6 different squads left in a circle with 10 people alive. This is also frustrating for the players who get thirsted as they then have to spectate for a 15-20 minute game, assuming you die early and your squad wins.

Just refund the people who bought all of them and make them selectable styles. 
The NFL skins are 1500 per with 32 Styles. There are only 4 male and 4 female. The only difference being skin colour/hair (which you can't really see). 
The soccer skins are the same except they're 1200 per with, yet again, 32 styles. 

I just watched some guy spend $200 buying all of the winter set skins because he thinks that one of the styles will become rare. It should be $15 to buy a male with 8 selectable styles not $120 to buy 8 versions of the same skin.

This is just my opinion and I believe that with the amount of skins coming out now that have multiple selectable styles (all with more detail) that these should be updated to be the same too. ",FortNiteBR

It's overpowered early game because if they get the first swing off theres not enough time to finish breaking the roof you landed on and open a chest or even loot any weapon at all before you are eliminated. Although I do like it for mid-late game situations, it's a cheap way to get a kill early game. When it was 10 dmg per swing you at least had a chance to loot what you were going to loot and get the best of the person who landed on you. The way it is now my only defense is to completely leave the chest I was going for and let the other player loot it while I have to rush to find different loot while also being at 60-80 hp depending on how many swings they got off on me.

If or when they add the 50 hp per elim pickaxing players at the start of the game will become an even more viable strategy because there wont be much of a downside. If you swing first, even if they swing back at you you will get the elimination with at least 20hp left plus the 50 you got from the elimination putting you at 70hp and 1 elim + the loot + one less player in the town to worry about.

Maybe a possible solution to keep it at 20 dmg per swing could be to make it so that your first pickaxe swing of the match on another player doesn't deal damage so that they have a chance to react before it's too late. Or just make it 10 damage again but I do like it being 20 for mid-late game.",FortNiteBR

If it was stretched it would be a 1024x768 fullscreen resolution that fills up my screen. I tried every solution I know: I tried going into the usergamesettings and making the Fullscreen spot ""0"" and I was recommended to go into the Nvidia Control Panel but I'm on a laptop top so I don't have the Custom Resolution settings.

There is little punishment for using them and on top of that way are way too powerful. Here is my suggestion how to fix this. Usually my post don‚Äôt get a lot of attention but hopefully this one does because these fixes IMO would make the game more enjoyable.


**Remove the  built-in turret that is in the plane**
Honestly there is no reason for the plane to have this and this just makes it easier to builds to be broken. Not to mention that the plane already has a boost that sends player flying and destroy builds as well.

**Remove the boost mechanic from the plane**
As I mentioned earlier the plane allows you to boost through builds and send players flying. This is a terrible idea and was the worst feature implemented into the plane, possibly the entire game. It is so incredibly easy to kill players by either crushing them, knocking down from their builds, or send them flying off a mountain. I won‚Äôt sugar coat or defend this mechanic because nothing good comes from it.

If these fixes just so happen to be noticed and implemented into the game, then I feel like planes will be not only still be a valid option for fast rotations, but will also be balanced. 

TL:DR
**I feel like the plane should only be used for rotations and transportation and not as a weapon of mass desturction**

Cant find anyone...,"FOREWORD: While this title might sound like a complaint post towards season 7, its not, its my attitude towards the game in general that im trying to assess.

My Fortnite journey began the same as many others, started playing this game at launch last year. This was my first BR game and those first few wins were pure ecstasy for me. I was immediately hooked, this might have been the greatest feeling I have ever had in gaming.

I would say the feeling carried through until summer when I slowly started losing interest due to encountering game after game where I find nobody until the last couple circles and the first person I encounter is some insanely skilled player who landed tilted and has at least 15 kills. This person usually kill me so fast I have no idea what even hit me, I try to watch their plays and I simply cant comprehend their decisions, they just play like gods on top of their game and im just playing like trash. And I hate landing Tilted because it just feels like an RNG fest of who picks up the closest gun first, not fun at all imo.

This slowly started to wear on me after seeing how bad my stats were going downhill compared to the first couple seasons, and I eventually decided to give the game up for a while in hopes that I just needed an extended break.

Well I came back recently (start of season 7) and ive gotta say I still run into the same issue: game after game in solos where I believe I pick warm drops like pleasant when its near the start of the bus, and ill get legit one guy that lands there and is a complete noob who barely knows how to loot (no offense to him or anything, but I would just like someone who is at least decent so I can get better). Ill then proceed to literally find nobody until top 10 where some guy with an insane amount of kills swoops in from god knows where and absolutely humiliates me with a trap play or something. Oh great, spent 20 minutes looting up and running around for literally nothing, cool...

Does anyone else find themselves in this purgatory with solos on a daily basis? Like I want to fight people and get better, but I dont want to land Tilted because I hate getting killed right off the bat to a guy who just landed and picked up a gun a second before me because half the server is there... Like where can I land to find some people, but not ALL the people, you know?",FortNiteBR

This applies to the end game as well.

2 - The planes are great but they added a lot of scavengers. Again, this makes passive play a better option.

3 - There is already too much RNG when finding shield. I have games where I find two big pots right away. Other games I dont find shield untill end game, even with 8+ kills. Getting shield from kills takes some of the RNG away.

4 - New players will finally have a reason to try to find fights, especially in start game.

5 - The current material gathering rate is horrible. It was great in the start when no one were building. But at this point, every fight consume atleast 200 wood, unless you got some natural cover. The current farming rate is made for season 1-2 Fortnite. This was a year ago. We need a change.

But considering I played this game for 8+ hours a day from launch through mid-season 4 I usually get baited back at the start of new seasons to try and see if maybe this game has returned to a playable form. Turns out, yeah this game is playable again imo. Weapon balance seems nice, shotguns are solid again, building seems to be in a good spot. But then, for no fucking reason other than because they can, they add in tanks with wings. Why? What exactly are planes in the game for? They are completely broken and have no purpose other than to please an increasingly youthful playerbase. They have too much health, they carve through any and everything, and you barely take damage even when you facefuck the ground at full boost. Why are they in the game. This season without planes would be amazing. Not S3 amazing, but it would be the most bearable season since then imo. If there is some type of storyline implication or purpose then *maybe* I can stomach a temporary WW2 Airforce invasion. But if these things are permanent then this is the exact reason why the Devs are killing this game. They add shit in because they can and not for balance or necessity.

By it's nature, BR was slower paced, more tactical, more strategic.

Now tomorrow we're getting another mobility item that's going to speed up the game even more.

I feel the path Fortnite is on is for players who want non stop action and not for players like me who want more interesting choices to make.

I predict sometime in the next two or three years, a slower paced more tactical Fortnite competitor will release and steal a percentage of Fortnites players.

There's no doubt about that and they were done right where they don't feel too crazy overpowered, but I think a couple adjustments need to be made to complete the balance. Most recently EPIC added a 25 dmg explosion dynamic which was a great start, but I don't think its enough.   


In tourneys for example, people land somewhere remote - loot up as well as needed and hop in planes and just circle around the map in the air until late game for free points. There isn't enough incentive to get out of them for people to care about the 25 damage they will take if you were to shoot them down.

&amp;#x200B;

I've talked with several people about this and so far the best two suggestions I've heard are the following....  


1. Increase the damage from 25 to 75. That would be enough for people to jump out as their plane is damaged enough.
2. If you don't jump out before the plane is shot down and destroyed, re-deploy is disabled. Sort of the same mechanic already implemented in the game that there is a risk building up high - so people are cautious of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you guys think - and/or if anyone has any better ideas to keep the integrity of the game in tact. I don't think planes will ever get vaulted, nor do I think they should, but I do think slight adjustments and elements to them should be taken into consideration on top of the 25 dmg previously added.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all!

Building is currently underpowered, I didn't fall in love with a farming simulator back in Season 2. Any player who played before Season 4 will agree that the game was alot more fun when everyone had a decent amount of mats. The battle is no longer building, because epic wants to appeal to mobile players and 5 year olds.

Shield and Materials on kill is obvious. Fighting people I currently useless, you'll just loose your health and materials for a few mediocre items. I should be stronger after a fight, not the opposite. This would also make 3rd partying less annoying and add a better flow to the game in general.

They make Fortnite look extremely cheesy and silly. I propose something: an update/patch in wich fortnite as a whole will fix major bugs that make the game less enjoyable, and as little as much for the new content. I also belive that they should stop releasing so many new skins and possibly rotate the older ones into the shop. They are working too hard on producing content rather than making the game experience more enjoyable. I absolutely hate it. There are tons of bugs that should be dealt with:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. the zip-line rift bug (important to say I don't know if it's still in the game but I saw it in a video that was uploaded \~yesterday so it's safe to assume): I litteraly saw a player try to use a rift but couldn't because there was a zip-line above it. When he tried to get into the rift he couldn't because the hitbox would hit the zip-line first, making the rift unusable.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Walking in a direction while not pressing the key: I died to this bug \~10 minutes ago when playing a casual match, it is frustating enogh as it is often. When build-fighting in playground I would've died twice if I hadn't deactivated fall-damage as a whole because of its frequency. I have noticed that it is quite often met when editing.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. No pump shot / shots connecting to a player but not dealing damage: The title is quite self-explanatory but it is annoying as hell. I thought I killed a player once because it showed that all my shotgun shells/slugs got into his head, but when I spectated the game I saw that the shots trough the player, not dealing any damage. Also when looked from another POV it showed that the shots didn't even connect at all. I admit that my aim is not perfect. I miss shots but atleast don't show me that the shots were connected.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Auto-building bug (not sure if it's intended but I will list it here): I am not sure if it even exists, but  I feel like I can't depend on auto-building anymore. I feel like I can't shoot then build so fast anymore, and the problem is even more met when doing 90 degree turns. I  feel overall that my builds are slower.

My son streams his game play and has gotten quite a little following.  I can purchase him better streaming equipment and get OBS running so the stream looks and acts better, which I did.  But there is one thing I would need help on, and that is a few more subscribers. The threshold of reaching 1k is within reach, and all it takes is a simple subscribe on YouTube.  And really, this would probably be the best xmas present he could get, it is honestly all he talks about.  So, if possible, please help a kid get an Xmas miracle and subscribe to

*Hello, had to upload this a thrid time, because I did not know that I would need a desrciption, so here it is:*

The main concept of the skin is a **bee**. She has a helmet with a black visor and antennas. As here Backbling I¬¥ve chosen some simple **bee wings**. Comment below if you got a name for the backbling.

The pickaxe of the ""bee set"" is called ""**Stickaxe**"" and it is a beenest on a stick. On my previous post people came up with the idea that it could leave some honey behind and make ""bzzZ"" sounds if you hit something.

The helmet could be an **edit style** so you can remove it (maybe even only the visor), if you prefere it without one and the **skin rarity** should ""bee"" blue or purple.",FortNiteBR

Epic if you are reading this, please leave the planes as they are, if you feel a tweak is needed please only make it minor and not change the entire mechanic. Me and my group of about 6/7 friends are largely casual players who used to play most nights together but stopped for the majority of s5/6. Just recently we started playing again and it was the planes that made us have fun again. Take from that what you will as I'm sure my and my friends make up most of your player base.

So last year around December, I was very depressed. So depressed I almost committed suicide. But I didn‚Äôt. Why? Because one day as I was playing fill squad, I found a nice guy. He was very kind and reassuring, so we immediately became best friends.

From there on me and him started playing Fortnite nearly everyday. And as the days were passing, slowly but surely I noticed my depression fading away. Through the help and wholesomeness of my friend ‚Äîas well as this community‚ÄîI managed to get rid of my depression.

So today I wanna thank this community for being so nice and wholesome. You being the way you are saved a life, and who knows‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôve said thousands of lives?

All I ask of this community is to continue being wholesome. Hopefully together we can all help put an end to suicide. Once again, thank you all very much.

As a Fortnite player, let me start with this. The game is fun. I‚Äôm trash at the game, but I‚Äôm getting better, and it‚Äôs fun to do so.

HOWEVER, as a Fortnite Switch player, I‚Äôll say this: we‚Äôre getting the shortest possible end of the stick in terms of the game.
 
I‚Äôll start with the most common problem: Ramirez lobbies. 

Now, I know people love their default skins, but even I know when enough is enough. All jokes aside, HALF OF THE LOBBY IS A DEFAULT RAMIREZ SKIN. This problem is only present on Switch to my knowledge.

The only skins that load are battle pass skins and the occasional holiday skins. Other than that, everyone is a Ramirez. 

I remember playing with my cousin on Xbox and he was spectating me. I died to a default skin, but on his Xbox, it was a Blue Team Leader or whatever the girl with the blue hat‚Äôs name is. 

But the point is the same: skins aren‚Äôt loading up on this game. And it sucks, especially when you buy a skin only for someone to not even see it. 

Secondly, frame rate.

CLEARLY, we‚Äôre not Xbox or PlayStation, or PC, but we run at, what, 30 FPS on a good day? 

Even then, when we get into a fight/build battle, or even one of the LTMs Like 50v50 or Food Fight, our framerate takes a nosedive. It‚Äôs so laggy, the only way for it to stop is if you get killed. 

EVEN MOBILE HAS BETTER FPS THAN US, AND SWITCH IS AN ACTUAL CONSOLE! (no hating on the mobile players btw; y‚Äôall get enough crap as it is)

It‚Äôs hard for me to enjoy the game when the performance is so bad that I can barely play it.

Thirdly, where‚Äôs our careers tab? The other consoles have it! PC has it! Why can‚Äôt we?

Another post summed it up beautifully: if you guys can track how many shield mushrooms we eat, why can‚Äôt you let us track our wins? Even If we look online, we still can‚Äôt see our wins!

Plus, I‚Äôd love to go into replay mode and see how exactly I died and learn based off of it.

Finally, and I don‚Äôt know if this is just for Switch but I haven‚Äôt heard any of the other console users post about it, our music cuts off in game and in the home screen.

What‚Äôs the point of adding these cool tracks if we can‚Äôt even listen to them for five seconds without hearing nothing?

I‚Äôm likely missing a lot, but these are MAJOR issues that we need fixed.

‚ÄúOh, but why don‚Äôt you just go to PC/Xbox/PS4?‚Äù

Because I don‚Äôt have access to either of those. I can play on PC, but I have an i3 core; due to that, my PC Fortnite is for Save the World only. 

But anyway, if you simply search ‚ÄòSwitch‚Äô in this subreddit, you‚Äôll see some posts about the switch‚Äôs problems and what needs to be done for the game to be fixed on this specific console.

I hope Reddit sees at least ONE of those kinds of posts and starts working on a fix.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

easiest solution is to nerf the damage vs structures down to something like 50-70  


A much better solution is to add a cool down between swapping any weapons and shooting again, similar to the cool down between swapping shotguns. This should also be added between editing and shooting to even out the playing field, and not have it just be a battle of who has the better ping. There should be some inherent risk to doing an edit on an opponent. As it currently stands a player can edit, shoot, and re-edit before their opponent can do anything. This would also remove ""edit delay"" because there would be a fixed delay between editing and shooting.",FortNiteBR

I love this game and it's about the only game I've played for the last year+, as I'm pretty busy with work and don't get to play as many things as I'd like. I've had a lot of fun in this season, don't get me wrong, I've had some of my best finishes and ""plays"" I've ever had in any game during this season. However, it has gotten to the breaking point where I just can't do it anymore. 

Planes are ridiculous, as much as Epic will want to ignore it. They're fun for the people that are in them, and a pain for anyone who isn't. I've had my fair share of frustrations with the planes, but I just spent an entire game racking up 9 kills from landing at Retail to making my way to Paradise. I was feeling pretty good and thought it could very well turn into another win to add to my column. I loot up, get the mats I think I'll need, and hit a rift. I land on top of the huge hill next to Paradise and start scouting the area looking for where I should make my next move.

I hear the rift go off right next to/above me, and realize that someone is coming down towards me. I whip out my hunting rifle and hit him right before he lands, then proceed to connect a couple of scar shots and he goes into turbo build mode.

In comes the problem; two planes decide they're just going to divebomb us over and over. We're sitting there trying to fight each other as we're both posing a pretty serious threat to eachother, but these planes just keep circling and flying right through the build battle we're trying to have. I finally break through and kill the opponent (which was a good fight just in case you're reading this) and not 1 second later, the plane comes through my builds and sends me flying off the side of the mountain to my death. I spent all game playing well, racking up a total of 10 kills, making smart plays, and doing everything right just to have it all ended by a vehicle slamming through my builds over and over and over again while I can do nothing about it.

Epic, how many deaths have occurred from other vehicles you have put into this game? Sure, there's the occasional funny clip of someone ramming a quad into buildings and hitting people, but that's a 1 in a million thing. Planes directly kill multiple people every single match. If you look at that and don't realize, or fail to acknowledge, that something is wrong, then I don't even know what to say and it makes walking away from this game a little bit easier.

So I've greatly enjoyed it. It has been a fun game and I've had an absolute blast playing it, but it's time for me to pick up something else until they make changes to make the game fun again.",FortNiteBR

Something needs to be done.,"I can‚Äôt do squad games anymore because every time I get close to the top 30 people, I see a plane and if they see us, they shoot infinite amounts of ammo without dying and if we shoot them down, they land on us taking barely any damage from the plane explosion because they have full shield and health and then they throw down port a fortresses and camp their ass off and rush us with pumps and we die. The plane is too overpowered and there is literally no downside to being in one. It can fly through structures without taking any damage unlike the quad bike where it takes fall damage and damage from collision. It also has a turret on the front that is just as powerful as a mini gun but with a longer cooldown. Also they are WAY to common in this game. There are 2-3 plane locations for every section of the map and that‚Äôs all I see every game. I‚Äôm seeing it more now because they removed the IB and people want something new to exploit.",FortNiteBR

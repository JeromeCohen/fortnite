The sled would be best used to quickly ambush people that are at the base of your hill, and to move to the circle a little faster, depending on how big the hills are (the hills on the west side of the map are huge, but the hills on the east side are tiny and wouldn't give you enough time to build much speed, for instance).

Her aim is alright in shooters, but she's not great at controlling her character or aiming really quickly. Anyways, she loves Fortnite, she started by watching me play it, then she insisted she try, now I made her her own PSN and Fortnite account that she plays on. She's played about 30 games so far, and she finally got her first win. She started out landing at a house with one other person. She grabbed the only weapon in the house, an smg, and opened fire while he hit her with a pickaxe. She got the kill and survived with 6 health. Luckily, she got a medpack and a shield potion from the house so she was still good when it came to HP. She then heads out from the house and encounters the wooden covered bridge on the south side of the map near flush factory. She got stuck there for 3 minutes trying to get both the chests. (She kept falling from the bridge) she doesn't get the idea to hightail it out of there until the storm literally overtook her. She started to quit but I told her she could make it. For the next 5 minutes she was running to make it to the eye of the storm. As she made it to the next eye, it was already starting to shrink again. She finally made it out of the storm with no bandages, and 24 health. As she went to hide behind a tree, she started hearing sniper bullets wizz by her head so she ran for a house. Luckily, inside this house she found bandages and got up to 75 health, and 50 shield. The circle, at this point, is enclosed around tomato town. She takes shelter in the tunnel. She stays there for another 2-3 minutes while the amount of people alive drops to 5. Finally, the eye forces her to move, as it has closed around the red house outside of tomato town. She sneaks all the way to the house, hugging the hillside as long as she could. Finally she makes it to the house and decides not to go inside of it, but to hug the wall outside the door because she didnt want people to hear her open the door. She had her back to a corner where two outside walls met so she was pretty well defended. At this point there were 3 people alive, her and 2 others. Then a miracle happened and the eye closed in a way that the remaining people would have to run essentially right in front of her. So she sat and waited, ready to light up anything that moved when she started hearing explosion after explosion behind her, then suddenly: ""Victory Royale!"". My girlfriends hands shot up immediately as she screamed ""yay!"". I look at the death feed and one player died to the storm and another blew themselves up. Now, I don't know what the Fortnite gods concern themselves with, but I'm positive they had something to do with giving my girlfriend her first win.",FortNiteBR

Compared to call of duty and other shooters where aim assist only slows on target, this game has a really wide aim assist. It makes it hard to snipe and hard to aim at people running because the cursor is really slow while trying to catch up. 


Also, the aim assist on downed players is annoying because when they are at your feet it they will pull your aim down and off other people in front of you.

I think the option to disable it would help for now, but overall a total system revamp would help a lot.

It never feels good backing out after winning your drop with a man or two down.

It also never feels good making them watch you play out the rest of the match.

The way I think it could be would have 2 states of being downed.

1st state: the current down position where you are extremely immobilized but your items are preserved

2nd state: this would just be the dead state, your items get dropped for your enemies or allies to pick up, but the little drone that normally takes you out of the game would stick around until your squad is wiped, it can revive you or an ally at some cost

-Can only be found in chests 

-It can be used to bait enemies, or for yourself, opening up some unique possibilities

-Fire into the air to create a vertical arc, so that it drops somewhere in front of you.  The flare goes very high and makes a distinct sound, so it notifies enemies near you that you have signalled for a supply drop.

If you have any more issues with the system please write them and i will put them on here.

So what would be better? I have a couple of ideas:

(With both of these ideas, traps stack. So if you have two spike traps they appear as one spike trap with the number 2 somwhere.)

* A keyboard shortcut to just simply cycle through the traps would be faster and wouldn't block your vision.
* A similar idea but with visual presentation that is unobtrusive. Something like what you see on a slot machine, i can't think of a better way to describe it. The controls would work like this: You press T and can then scroll with your mouse through the traps to select one by confirming with pressing T again. Alternatively the new default bind could be mouse wheel click.

I'm sure this is a familiar story but the lag and un-optimised nature of PUBG has finally become too much and I've installed Fortnite. It's refreshing to play a more professionally polished BR game and the combat already to me feels like skill is possible and not hindered by random lag and rubber banding. Excellent!

However I like a game with customisation, it's nice to become familiar with your character especially when playing with a friend. This seems almost impossible without paying for Vbucks but the cost is just so astronomically high I can't get on board.
It's not that I don't have the money, it's just I don't value a single skin or outfit at ¬£10.

This is a real shame, as I could see myself spending a lot of money on this game but not at ¬£10 a pop. 

You really need to re-think your system as this is keeping me on the fence and the moment PUBG is in some sort of optimised state, I likely won't be back.

Just my 2 pence, I hope it helps.",FortNiteBR

So it was time... ""Son, we need to have a talk.""

Over the course of two hours we discussed the various weapon classes (such as hand guns, rifles, sub, semis, full) and how they are simulated in fps games.

Hitscan vs Leading. How they are programmed in different games (like BF4 vs Fortnite) and why.

Bullet drop, damage drop off, range, spread, cone, bloom, recoil.

Pump, bolt, semi, full.

Rate of fire vs damage per bullet/per pellet vs damage drop vs hit location.

I had drawings going of bullet accuracy vs range vs spread.

I was doing drawings of gun mechanics. Where the bullets go how they chamber, how they fire, pump, semi, full.

What makes up a bullet. Bullet/shell types, purpose, range, spread, recoil, auto. Barrel length vs bullet vs accuracy.

Getting blown up by a rocket or grenade should send the body flying.  Shooting someone on a hill should send their body tumbling down. Shotgunning up close should send the body backflipping.

As wildly popular as it is, I can see I am not alone. I just wanted to add a few suggestions on how to make this game better. 

-	I suggest shields be changed. I think instead of finding shield potions throughout the map, everyone should be given 1,000 shield for each person they kill. 
-	I think we should be rewarded with v-bucks and cosmetics just by playing the game. Every time we win a game we should be given the choice of any ten items from the shop, and as a participation award we should be given 2500 v-bucks for each game we play. 
-	I think AR bullets should hit the target you are aiming at every time you shoot, no matter what, with absolutely no recoil or bloom. I want to be able to one-shot across the map with a common AR. However, I do think for balance reasons I should be somehow immune to that. 
-	I think we should have the ability to respawn after death. 
-	We should be able to hold as many items in our inventory as we want. I hate having to decide between an extra bush or carrying bandages. 
-	Oh, and bandages should heal you to 200hp. 
-	When you kill another player their loot should automatically be transferred to you so you don‚Äôt have to risk your life to get it. Also, their kill count should be added onto yours. 
-	We should be able to pick our characters and choose a loadout of weapons and gear to start the game with. 
-	I would like an invisibility potion to be added into the game so I can make quick escapes from gunfights without being seen. This should go into a grenade/med/consumable/potion pouch so it doesn‚Äôt use an inventory slot. 
-	We should have a practice map where we can go to get really good at the game without having to actually play it. 
-	Kill cams should be added so I can watch them and see how the game just screwed me over because there‚Äôs no way I actually let that guy outplay me and it‚Äôs obvious he was cheating. 
-	Epic should take every other feature, gun and gadget from all of the other games I‚Äôve played and add them into this game. 
-	SMGs should not be in chests. Only legendary SCARs, rocket launchers and sniper rifles should be in chests. 
-	Everyone should get at least three chests as soon as they land. 
-	You should also be invincible for the first 20 minutes of the game so you can loot, and start with 998 of each material. 
-	I think we should get a new map pack with ten new maps every Tuesday. 
-	Every time I win a game the devs should come to my house and pat me on the back while telling me how great I am. 

These are my suggestions on how to make this game better. Fortnite is such an awesome game and I love it just the way it is, I just think all of these small changes should be implemented so I can love it even more. ",FortNiteBR

While I think that the assault rifles are now accurate, I think that the way they have done it is incredibly stupid.


As it is, the assault rifles are pretty much pinpoint accurate regardless of fire rate. From my experience, both killing and being killed, the M4 is just as accurate single tapped as it is when spraying.


I'm sure I'll get downvoted by the people saying ""give them time"" but this is definitely one of the most poorly executed changes. In what world is it a good idea to make the gun pinpoint accurate while holding down the trigger. It would be so much better if they added recoil, this way you can't just hold down the trigger and get a guaranteed kill.


I just feel like this is a half baked update at best. It's like they don't think about what will happen when they change it. It's fairly obvious that if you make a gun pinpoint accurate regardless of whether you spray or single tap, its going to be fucking overpowered like it is. If they couldn't realise that making a gun a literal laser was a bad idea, that's pretty worrying.


TLDR:


Making the Assault rifle pinpoint accurate all the time is retarded. Reducing the bloom while not adding any recoil is honestly the dumbest decision that they could make.",FortNiteBR

APB Reloaded has it and it's the bread and butter of the game, even Battlefront 2 has it and ME: Andromeda even gave it an own animation where the character switches the weapon from one hand to the other, making the character lefty and righty at the same time (the best solution to smooth out the gameplay, since Fortnite isn't realistic, it would fit like gloves)

Another game which come to mind is Max Payne 3, which also offers a camera swap. Also the PUBG, the main competitor, offers this feature (though they make the characters not swap hands, just camera)

Right now the crosshair is fixed to the right side, which limits the freedom of movement, creates blindspots and generally feels uncomfortable, when other 3rd person shooters offer it and you've felt the immense benefit of it! Since bullets spawn from the centre and not the barrel of the weapon from what i've gathered, it would be even easier to implement.

Can't be that this feature is not requested more often on here, to me it's mandatory for the enjoyment of any TPS game! It would simply make the game better, without any downsides. Since Fortnite is strictly 3rd person and such a high profile TPS, it boggles my mind that Epic Games hasn't implemented this yet, even though it should've been a release feature. Many players simply don't see or know the benefits from it.

However I do agree that the headshot multiplier could be toned down to 2 or even 1.5; I can easily outduel shotguns close range, and with just a little luck I can outsnipe medium-long range snipers.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;

I previously [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7e2k3b/unkillable_opponent/) asking for assistance, but now it is clear to me, that this must be either a bug in the ""combat text"" or the ""shield calculation"", can someone more knowledgable or developer please confirm?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

This adds up to the sum of 179 (leaving 21 hp remaining)
However, this is not the case, as proven in the 3nd clip above he has 3 shield and 12 hp.

&amp;nbsp;

I know, that the clip is splittet and does not show any 100% conclusive documentation, that he hasn't popped a slurp juice, but I can hereby vouche, that he did in fact not, as I was spectating him and he cannot consume it whilst, at max hp and shield, so how should it be possible for him to still have 3 shield left when all the damage delt to him was to his shield.

&amp;nbsp;

This leaves me to conclude, that it must have been either 1) a bug in regards to text/calculation or 2) exploit/hack (I doubt it is this, but have to mention it still)

&amp;nbsp;

I DO NOT dwell on it, rather, loving this community and this amazing game that you made, that I want to present you with this ""proof"" in hope for a discussion and/or solution, thanks! ‚ô•",FortNiteBR

||Wood|Brick|Steel|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Floor/Stairs hp|min 95 / max 190 |min 84 / max 280|min 74 / max 370|
|Floor/Stairs hp per tick|+12 (8 ticks)|+9 (22 ticks)|+8 hp (37 ticks)|
|Wall hp|min 100 / max 200|min 90 / max 300|min 80 / max 400|
|Wall hp per tick|+13 (8 ticks)|+9 (24 ticks)|+9 (36 ticks)|

What does this mean?

When you're getting shot at, dropping a wooden wall is your go-to option for building fast cover, because it has the highest initial hp, while having by far the fastest building rate as well. This means that rushing someone with stairs should also be done with wood when possible. On the other hand, bases require strong materials and steel walls are obviously the strongest with 400 hp. But if you're under attack, using fresh steel as cover might be the last thing you do. Interestingly enough, initial and maximum hp of bricks is right in the middle, while the building rate basically equates steel. This makes bricks a less valuable resource overall.

So in general, wood is more effective for the first 6.4 seconds compared to bricks and 6.8 seconds compared to steel. Anything after that, bricks and steel become the stronger materials.

Also, for anyone wondering, roofs have the same numbers as floors and stairs.

Some other interesting facts to take into account:

Wooden elements are roughly 1/3rd see-through even after they are fully built, so te enemy can still see your exact position behind the walls, while steel almost fully closes all gaps. Even more, I'd recommend using steel walls or stairs as backdrop on top of bases to make yourself harder to be seen peeking, thanks to the camouflage patterns of steel elements. Try it, it really does make a difference.

That's all I can think of for now. Hope it helps any of you guys.

Tl;dr

Wooden walls are your best friend for saving lives, steel walls are best for building bases, collecting bricks is not the safest choice of resource (unless a wall spawns a gnome, then it's op).",FortNiteBR

Every shooter game I have ever played online there is a group of players that believe if the game mechanics were simply changed to give them more chance at surviving then they would be better at the game. This is impossible. You nerf guns and now your gun is also nerfed. The players with more skill still out gun you and you lose. You nerf defensive mechanics and the players that can out build you still out build you and you lose. **You can not nerf skill!**

Nerfs are **global** ladies and gentlemen. There will never be a patch that gives you a special upper hand against a player that is better than you to ""level"" the playing field. Stop asking for it because you are only begging to butcher game mechanics in order to selfishly try and gain an upper hand. Meanwhile the players you are so upset about are adapting and learning the mechanics to become that better player while you cease to elevate because you see it as some kind of problematic game mechanic that needs to be ""fixed"" instead of just accepting that you were simply out played.

So go right ahead and pitchfork the developers into changing this great game to cater to your casual playstyle. You will forever be out played and forever be on this reddit begging for solutions to your inability to adapt and overcome just like every other skill based shooter game to ever exist. Meanwhile, while a couple hundred people on reddit believe they are the general majority there are over one hundred thousand players in game right now having a fantastic time with the current state of the game.

At least let us bandage to 100% health after a fight.

As for shield pots, they aren't necessary in the game IMO and reward camping and hiding which sure can be fun but there's already enough mechanics for that (building, bushes etc).

The state of the game right now is that you can have FOUR meds in your invent and two guns.

My suggestion would be an overhaul/consolidation of the medical pickups, make bandages into a left click/right click item that takes multiple bandages to heal you (with an increasing time) and left the left click standard bandage function.

Remove shield pots entirely, or make them a non-pickup item or something. People should be rewarded for winning fights as much if not more than for avoiding them.

If bandages can't heal to 100% then make slurp juice more plentiful, but IMO it's an unnecessary item altogether.

Even if I have the drop if the fight isn't going well, I usually just run away.

And they're not even that interesting of skins to begin with. Almost all these other games also offer ways to earn that currency slowly overtime (disregarding PvE here because that's not the F2P part as of now), while allowing you to buy in for like $5-$10 or so to get what you want right away.

I'm just having a hard time believing people are so accepting of the obvious price gauging here. If the developers would at least mention lowering the cost at a later date once PvE goes live or that they'll add earned currency like PvE then that's fine, but I haven't seen anything about that. I mean, you're FORCED to pay at least $25 if you want anything. You can't even buy a smaller amount for a single skin. 

It's just such an exploitative and gross business practice and it seems like so many people here are just o-k-doki being taken advantage of. 

Edit: Just to expand a little more, this is the kind of mentality that leads us to things like the Battlefront controversy. No, it's not as serious and extreme, but allowing developers to think that it's okay to place content behind enormous paywalls, especially for things as simple as cosmetics, should NOT be encouraged.

I had recently purchased the special edition Halloween Scythe skin for the axe.  When I first purchased the new item it showed an epic rarity(purple) in my inventory. About a few weeks ago this changed down to the blue rarity, I forget what its called. Anyway, I was waiting for someone on youtube or twitch to mention something about it but havent heard anything.  I'm just wondering if this is a glitch and if my item should be purple or not.  If its not a glitch I felt like that was sort of messed up. I did pay 8$ for that item and felt like it shouldve stayed purple.  Not a super big deal, but just something that kind of annoyed me....",FortNiteBR

I really like the game (BR that is) but it really bugs me that I can only play late night because basically the only teammates you get are children who mostly troll over voicechat and teamkill. 

Ever other game starts with highfrequent prepubescent voices asking me ""Where are you from?"" ""Have you cats?"" ""Speak you german?"" . 

I would like to compete in random teams in the game, but its literally impossible to measure your skill against others currently unless you play ultra late night. I would be more than willing to spend $$$ if there was an option to play 16+, 18+ or 21+.

Switching off VoIPis not an option and doesn't solve the problem of teammates and enemies with children mindset.

The fact that teamkilling is a bannable offense doesn't really prevent it from happening as accounts are free and multiple ones can be made really quickly. If the game had a paid access option, people wouldn't risk getting banned that easily.

Dear Epic,

My only concern with adding all these new items (bush, silenced smg, smoke grenade coming soon, etc.), is inventory management. **While Epic keeps adding to the pool of items, there is nothing being taken away.** This makes the loot pool growing, but having no improvements on the management of this ever growing loot pool concerns me, personally.

I think it's worth looking into inventory management stuff next before going further adding more items. **Here are some ideas that could help with managing the new large loot pool:**

- 6th slot maybe?
- Allowing us to pick up like something like 12 items, but you can only have 6 in the inventory bar, so we could still go to touchpad (PS4) and change out items in our actual hot bar?
- Allow for some items to not count against the current 5 slots (grenades, med-packs, bandages, etc.)? A lot like how traps are today.
- As u/Random_Pandas pointed out, maybe a 6th slot that is only a grenade slot (either smoke or frag can be in that slot)?

Idk, it's just a few ideas, but I could just see it starting to get frustrating soon trying to only have 6 slots but wanting to use these awesome new secondary items you are adding to the pool.

**You can actually increase your rate of fire with Pump shotguns if you switch between them while firing.** This works because it skips the pumping animation and you don't have to do it once you switch back to that gun.

This is incredibly helpful early game when you fight in big cities, because you will very often find 2x grey pumpshotguns and have lots of close range engagements. If you can't find a second Pumpshotgun, it's also worth to just fire one shot with it and then switch to your assault rifle/pistol to avoid having to wait for the long pump animation

I have been a die hard Destiny fan since it launced in 2014, and one of the biggest issues in that franchise was (has been) communication to the players that play the game non stop. Bungie got a little better as time went on, but the main issues players would voice would either go unnoticed, not be addressed, or would come so far down the road it was well overdue. Even now, I've completely moved from the D2 game to Fortnite for many reasons. 

I've only been playing Fortnite BR for about a month and I'm blown away. Epic communicates constantly with updates, deploying patches and new features to the game almost weekly. You all answer questions and feedback from the community regularly..head on with no bs. I'm literally not use to this, and it's clear you guys care about the players and your game.

A big THANK YOU is in order to you Epic, some of us take note of this and applaud you. As long as you guys continue to listen to the players, address issues and provide the great content you've made, I'm a fan for the long haul. Thank you!!!

1. Boots (Maybe Ninja shoes to go with the ""relaxed"" feel of the game): Reduce noise while moving or maybe increase jump height or sprint speed.



2. Nightvision or Thermal Goggles. ""Consume"" to toggle, would have to stay in inventory and would not disappear unless dropped

3. Flamethrower (just because)

4. Mines/Claymores (in the build slot). Traps currently dont have much use, mostly due to size and noise I would imagine 

5. Smoke/Gas/Flashbang Grenades

6. Adrenaline Shot. Increases HP at a rate similar to Slurp Juice but instead of a shield it greatly increases sprint speed for the duration.

7. Airdrop Flares. Calls in an Airdrop crate like the ones ingame. Downside being you cant shoot it down and its Visible to all players (shows a timer till it hits the ground?), giving your location away but assuming you hold them off the loot is yours.



Doubt any of these would ever make it in but it would be pretty sweet if they did!

My suggestion is to allow similar quick bindings that PC players have.

For example, tapping L1 + R1 should immediately place a wall down. This would be immensely helpful in making firefights more engaging and intense, and making the gameplay closer to what we have on PC. Quickly building a fort, as simple as four walls, is something you see on PC that greatly makes firefights more fun to play out because the building mechanics simply work better on PC.

Similar hot keys for buttons on the DPAD would also be greatly appreciated, like being able to attach certain weapons to left and right on dpad for immediate access.",FortNiteBR

Why on earth should I be able to kill a player with a sniper rifle, at long range, with a burst AR?

Once this AR buff comes on monday, the utility of the sniper rifle is going into the garbage.

They just buffed one gun into moderate relevancy (the SMG), and killed another gun (the sniper rifle) by buffing the games best weapon (the AR).

Since the aiming in this game is pretty much luck with how random the gun fire spread is. I think lowering the head shot damage could lead to better gun fights and decrease the amount of luck that goes into it. 

Personally I‚Äôm sick of being forced to need a Med kit at least to engage someone because of the idea they could one shot me. 

I understand that the game is based on survival and hiding is an option. However my idea would be to place all head shot damage for ARs under 75, forcing people to hit more than one shot kills.

Let's introduce yet another type of item!

Introducing boots, a new equippable item in Fortnite. These boots can be equipped either by double clicking them in your inventory or by dragging them to the equipment screen, also conveniently located in the inventory. Only one pair of boots can be equipped at a time.

So, what do boots *do*? Beside making you look fabulous and the envy of the whole battle bus?

I'm glad you asked!

**Boots of Running Fast** (Epic)

 - Increase movement speed by 50% (passive)

 - Taking non-Storm damage disables this bonus for 10 seconds

*Ever get caught in a gunfight when you were supposed to start moving and the storm is rapidly approaching? Fear not! With the Boots of Running Fast, you can finish looting your opponents and still make it home for dinner!*

**Fuzzy Winter Boots** (Epic)

 - Restores 1 hp/s to your character, up to 75.

*Turtling has never been easier... Or more rewarding! Hide in a corner with a shotgun pointed at the only entry point while you watch your health tick back up - shouldn't have taken that fall damage!*

**Sneaky Ninja Boots** (Legendary)

 - Reduces sound you make by moving by 50%

 - Also reduces sound you make by crouch-walking (not running) by 100%

*With these babies equipped, your opponents had better keep their eyes peeled - lest you peel their eyes for them! These pair (pun intended) extremely well with the new silenced SMG's, enabling base infiltration and stealth killing like never before!* 

Alright, one more:

**Seven-League Boots** (Legendary)

 - Increases jump height and forward momentum by 1000%

 - Reduces fall damage by 100% 

 - Hyperjumps have a 15s cooldown after landing.

*Thanks to the wonders of European folklore, players no longer require a rocket launcher to rocket ride - better yet, they don't even require a teammate! Hop into these boots, then hop into the sky! And unlike an unfortunate Morrowind character, we've actually thought of the adverse effects of gravity.*",FortNiteBR

We now that is importante Friendly Fire to keep with the strategy of the game, the need to take care when shoot to not kill or damage your teammate.

But we also know that some random team mates just kill your comrades to get their loot.

So, the idea is simple, make friendly fire turned on, but limite the damage they can do to your team mate, being impossible to leave your team mate with less than 1 HP, in this way, you can still damage and hurt your friend in team fights, but also being impossible to kill them, thinking like this TK will not be possible, but Frindly Fire will.

Ex: Your team mate is with full HP(100)
You shoot him and all you can do is 99 damage, your team mate will drop to 1 HP, he can die to a enemy but not to you.

If you get my point, your team mate will not be able to purposely kill you... Because if he try do, he will not be able to steal your loot, and if he try, you can hurt him too or/and just run away from him.

This will be happy to everyone.

The recent Silencer announcement might be a decent addition but doesn't make the weapon any better at actual combat.

The weapon that overshadows SMGs the most is the shotgun, it's simply better at low-range combat. But the big advantage shotguns have, is the ability to peak from behind walls to shoot then hiding until you can shoot again. This will never change due to the nature of shotguns and SMGs.

What if we focus on making SMGs stronger at low-range combat **in the open?**

So my suggestion is this: **how about keeping regular movespeed during ADS (while aiming)?** 

All other guns (as far as I know) make you move at around 50% movespeed while aiming, but this could be the one defining feature of SMGs, and thematically makes sense as a run-and-gun type of weapon.

It doesn't make the gun stronger, but makes it easier to stand up against shotguns at least out in the open.

NOTE: Initially I kept thinking what if SMG's niche was to constantly have ~15% MS bonus while equipped, but thematically this would also affect pistols and revolvers. Then I thought, why not? Maybe it will incentivize players to hold on to them til late game because currently no one does. This is another topic though.

I just don‚Äôt get the point. Is it to literally have one less opponent? Is it to get the loot? (I don‚Äôt see the point as it was early game and I didn‚Äôt have any major loot on me). Is it by pure evilness to just ruin another persons game?

It was down to the final 20 or so, i was solo/nofill in squads because i enjoy the chalange. The  circle was closing in on the South Eastern corner of the map, a team of four had set up camp in the prison and they were making it their home. They had filled the cracks, constucted their own watch tower in the center of the complex, and were keeping an eye out for anyone dumb enough to get too close. That was, after i had snuck in.

The moment i snuck in their walls undetected, i felt great. The infiltration theme from Metal Gear Solid went through my head. I made my way through the halls, looking for some kind of opening, somone splitting away from the group maybe, or some granades to take their tower down. Unfortunately, i didnt get that far into my virtuous mission before being caught, but thats not the point.

Forts are the best part of this game, easily. I see posts all the time here of the things people built, from an awesome megafort to a fun little pharaohs pyramid. Everyone loves their forts. Downside is, fort building only comes into play late in the game. And even then, youre often forced to leave it due to the circle, in which case you more than likely dont have enough materials to build a nice functiong base. But thats fine, its the nature of the game. But why isnt there a game mode with more of a focus on fort building and defending? Sure, theres PvE, but that dosnt really provide the thrill i was talking about earlier. Its the PvP aspect that makes it fun, having a real threat rather than simple AI zombies.

Epic should seriously consider making another mode for Battle Royale. Prehaps a large team based mode that allows you and your teamates to build a fort and defend it from enemy players. Capture the Flag would be fantastic for this sort of thing, ive seen it suggested before on this sub. Image 2 teams of 20 or so people, youd be given some materials at the start just to get things going, but the rest would have to be farmed over the map. I dont see the current BR map being a good candidate, so a new smaller and somewhat symmetrical map would be required to keep it all balanced. I image you could either attempt to sneak your way in with a handful of people much like what i did to the prison, or you could risk sending in a good portion of your players to overwhelm them. Weapons might be difficult to handle, prehaps it could be a set loadout for everyone with special weapons being hidden around the map in chests and such.

In any case, Fortnite could do with a Fort-heavy game mode, frankly i think it would be even MORE fun than BR is. What're your thoughts? Have you come up with any ideas like this?

TLDR; capture the flag would be great cause fort building is really fun.",FortNiteBR

The pump nerf felt like a nerf to a build heavy play style since it‚Äôs super long range was perfect for holding people trying to push you while you have the high ground.

But over all we don‚Äôt see anything to help people out who like to play aggressively. I would love to see a smoke nade introduced to help close distance with people who have positional advantage without taking a bunch of chip damage.

The only issue I am experiencing is one I've experienced since the game first dropped. When I am in a firefight, if I get killed there is a split-second lag before I appear dead on my screen. It may seem like I should have died, but from my POV that split-second is actually during the fight but the very very end of it. I feel like I'm kind of getting robbed of reaction time or the ability to fight by this and it happens every time, in every game type.
I don't really see a lot of discussion about this, and the game works fine the other 99.9% of the time. No lag or stuttering, but that last second before it shows I've been killed it completely locks up.",FortNiteBR

**MAP**

* C and D 4-5 (i.e. the areas either side of the river south from loot lake) are really barren and need a feature. I would love to see a huge bridge at the bottom of C4. With scaffolding etc etc. ""Golden Gate"" even fits their aliteration theme!
* I think dusty depot needs a little bit more to it. It feels a little simple compared to the other gems on this map. Maybe a 
rubbish-tip area adjacent that fits the industrial theme of this part. Could have landfill, some car-cubes and a big claw etc
* I absolutely love using below-level areas (e.g. basement of a house) to give my base extra levels. Please keep adding these!

**ITEMS**

* would love a trapdoor. Looks like normal metal/wood/brick floor. Opens when walked on.
* I know they're addressing it but trap sounds really need to be less annoying (apart from floor spikes). Even if the sound wasn't a massive warning to other players the noise makes me not want to deploy them in my base as then I have to put up with the buzzing.
* Slurp juice is a bit of a strange one in solo. Basically you always just drink it for the 25 shield and rarely get it in the late game. Maybe the suggestions on here about it giving 50 regardless are good. Its much better in the team games.
* Would like a backpack. A findable (probably purple?) item that increases inventory slots. Potentially could increase footstep noise as a trade-off

**WEAPONS**

* Why isn't there a purple of lots of weapons? Would be nice for variety. At least a purple pistol i'm sure wouldn't be OP (even if a purple pump shotgun might be too strong.)
* Would like more ""rubbish""/different weapons. Battle royal in my mind is about fighting with whatever you can get against all the odds i.e. with a frying pan etc. The Crossbow idea from another thread is great. I won't suggest a load because i gather they already have lots of weapons from the PvE but the point is about the flavour and variety which is a little lacking at the moment.


Stuff that's been noted by lots of people already that I would also feedback:

* SMG frequency needs reducing/weapon needs a buff
* Grenades not exploding
* Weapon change (weapon wheel/d-pad)


Stuff I just want to say is ace and great work on the game - 
Launch pad, tomato tunnel stairs, bush costume, the tall rocks outside salty springs.

Lets see if we can get a good discussion going here.

Ill be clear up front. I like the shield mechanic and dont think there is anything wrong with the current potion. They are not very rare and with the current headshot multiplier not overly strong too.

However i do agree with some of the people who complain that being aggressive is not really being rewarded. When you pick some early fights and end up with 75 hp you are at a disadvantage to players that took it easy and have 200hp. Of course this is a choice you can make. But we could add a little more incentive to being aggressive.

Here are my thoughts on a new potion.

**Shield Flask**

A 10HP shield potion that drops ( within a range of 50%-100% not sure about that yet) when you kill a person. It doesnt stack (and maybe there is a 30 second timer in wich you have to use it before it disapears) wich would make it a risk reward to loot it. This would be a nice topoff on you HP.

 It wont be very overpowered because even at 10 kills (where you are bound to take damage) its only a 100hp full shield.



I would also like to suggest a change:

**Slurp Juice**

Now gives you 50HP no matter what. This would give it some more uses other than just being good when you are on 75hp (for the full effect that is).

To explain:

At 50Hp it would bring you to 100HP

At 60HP it would bring you to 100HP +10 Shield

At 90HP it would bring you to 100HP +40 Shield




Those are my 2 cents on the current shield system. Care to discuss?

2. Use it as a trap that enemies would be teleported too(into storm or wall/ceiling trap.
3. Let one teammate breach a base and bring the squad behind.

Im sure theres many more applications people will find, but i think it would be such a fun addition. It could be the first gold trap. ",FortNiteBR

I would prefer to get the normal PS4 as its a bit cheaper but would push for the PS4 Pro if it makes a massive difference to this game?

Does it make a difference to this game? is the Framerate much better on the Pro?

Survivors have to utilize traps and make defensive towers to defend against the infected. The goal as a survivor is to stay alive until the timer counts down and the infected win if everyone becomes infected. ",FortNiteBR

This would make playing with randoms (no mic) much more intuitive.

Some example statements:

-""I need backup!""

-""Need ammo for x!"" (X is whatever gun you are holding)

-""Come check this out"" (For loot)

-""Enemies Spotted""

-""I need medical supplies"" (option for shield perhaps)

-""Somebody drop a weapon for me""

-""Let's Build here!""

-""Check out my map marker""

Just some suggestions, im sure im missing something obvious or ones that could be used for this BR specifically. Cheers mates.

The reason we were a Team was because for some reason there is no option to switch to duo mode, We can only access Squad and Solo. We tried Squad as just the two of us but got demolished every time by teams of 4. When we used the Auto fill, the other 2 randoms would always just go off and do their own thing. I find it kinda annoying that I can't access duo. I don't mind being banned (although I did not know that it was a big deal to team or even bannable, I just downloaded this game). Why is there no Duo Mode?

EDIT: Just to clarify, I will take this Ban and learn from it, We will not team in Solo again, Easy. I want to know Why there is NO option to Duo for us?

EDIT 2: Apparently as an Australian, we do NOT get to use the Duo mode unless we change to an American or European server. As it stands the Aussie servers have a 20 ping, while America has 290 ping and europe had 380 ping. So to play Duo here I have to deal with extreame lag, giving even less ability to play as a Duo. So for me there is no point playing this game anymore, With or Without the Ban.",FortNiteBR

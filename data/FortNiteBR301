The sky stalker looks like from ww2 and when you think about it theres a lot that they could add: military themed skins, flamethrowers (for the german wibe) and when it is militarised, maybe even weapon skins. Also about the weapon skins, I think they could be battlepass rewards, cheap items in the shop or awarded for levels (also would be nice if the level grind wouldnt be so painfully hard). So what do you guys think? Should this be a thing, or is this a terrible idea? Share you thoughts ",FortNiteBR

Already when firing, the reset time is long enough that the bloom effect is practically gone by the time the player is ready to fire again, why not remove it altogether?

It improves the single shot pistols without having to increase damage or fire rate or change anything that might be potentially too unbalanced, and it would be a barely noticeable difference that could breathe new life into close to midrange gameplay and perhaps make players actually consider picking up a gold pistol over a gray shotgun.",FortNiteBR

I know that the best way to grind exp would be full squads with 30&amp;#37; bonus friend exp but here's the thing:

1- All my friends that play don't even bother buying any of the battle passes.

2- I'm from Brazil region, meaning that most players here don't or can't afford the pass.

3- I don't want to be forced to play squad for exp because solo exp sucks.

Basically placement is more important than kills, why would I bother fighting to reach top 5 when I can let the other players do that for me? I just have to reach top 5 with 1 kill to get 150 exp without counting survival exp.

You just need to play the game and not play the game to get more exp, that's a nice contradiction on rewards there. ",FortNiteBR

But the past few days I've been actually getting really tilted at this game, when I land I've been getting not great weapons, grey pistols grey bursts and there will be someone close by and they'll just shotgun me for all my life. But then I had an instance where I was ads'ing with a blue pump, hit the shot at point black and around torso level/head and I did 8 damage ? Is this normal? Do I just suck ?

I watch a lot of fortnite documentaries and numerous streamers but when I try to implement their strategies I just die horribly, or I don't get to because I die early on.

Then, come season 4 where you start playing, and it starts to go downhill I guess you could say. Epic buffed the C4 to appeal to players who can't really build, so they can just blow it up. What came after that? No bad players were really using it, the tryhards use it now. Then, they add stink bombs which is cool in all, but think about it, what would a good player do after a fight and they need to heal? They'd box up and heal so they can take some sort of cover. Well, in this case you don't even need to shoot out the walls or roof to kill the player inside, just throw 3 stink bombs at the bomb. 1 stink bomb does 5 damage per second, multiply that by 3 you get 15 dmg per second. Then, tryhards use those as I have seen quite a bit. I just want your opinions on if the game is getting too hard or not.

After recently seeing multiple posts on this subreddit showcasing various useful ways to use pyramids, I am convinced that they are underrated and that more players should consider using them more often! Here's a list I've made of different ways that pyramids can be used to your advantage:

 * Pyramids can be placed on top of enemy grenades to absorb all of the damage

 * Pyramids can be used to efficiently cross Loot Lake, as showcased by u/Fickle_Platypus [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8swqfn/need_to_traverse_diagonally_across_loot_lake_do/)

 * Pyramids can be used as a substitute to a 1x1 to give yourself temporary cover to heal up, saving those ever more precious mats

 * Pyramids can be placed on top of floors if you're building a large platform and want to minimize the risk of getting shot down and dying to fall damage

 * If timed right, and with a little luck, pyramids can be placed on top of enemies to trap them underneath

 * Pyramids can be used on top of the ceiling of a 1x1 to give your structure more HP on the top (for example if you box in a teammate to revive them and may get shot at from above)

 * Pyramids can be pre-edited into stairs for Combat Pro players, or downwards-facing stairs for Builder Pro and PC players

 * Pyramids can be used to bait enemies into a trap kill, as showcased by u/Rexy943 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8rb29x/the_ultimate_bait_edit_into_a_trap/)

The new shooting model only made the current meta worse due to the fact that if you use FSA too much you risk getting sniped and the addition of fall off damage made poking players from range nearly useless.  Why not give us the original shooting model with high recoil and zero bloom?  This would prevent every fight from ending in a shotgun fight and you could actually slow players down who are attempting to ramp rush you.  At the very least maybe just reduce bloom so that our AR's feel at least a little accurate.  With this addition I think that a reduction of aim assist on console would be necessary to prevent every player from having perfect aim since as of right now the aim assist is too powerful but bloom makes it not that big of a factor.

You get 17xp/minute survived.

Surviving 1 extra minute gets you almost as much xp as getting a kill.

Attacking someone for a kill means risking your life, and either ends in you getting 20 extra xp or your game ending.

Avoiding that person entirely and surviving 2 extra minutes gets you more xp than killing the guy.

So why would you go after someone and risk your life? Why wouldnt you just camp the whole game for survival time and placement xp?

I once did an experiment to test whether camping or playing aggressively was a better tactic for xp grinding.  

I played aggressively, got 3 kills, and died fighting the 4th guy. I placed ~25th and got ~500 xp.

I then tried camping. Jumped and killed 1 guy who approached my hiding spot, and continued hiding for the rest of the game. I placed 6th and got ~900 xp. 

This shows that camping is a better xp grinding strategy than playing aggressively.

This is unhealthy for the game because camping ruins the flow of the game.

Why would someone want to risk their life to lower the number of people remaining when they can just hide and let everyone else fight each other?

The game cant flow if people are just hiding and no one is dying, but the game rewards large amounts of xp just for staying alive as opposed to kills.

To combat this, I propose the xp for kills is increased and survival time is decreased so that its mostly even (im not whining because i want maxed omega to be easier to get, i want kills to be more valuable and desirable).

Now, that traps don't depend for the material to finish building is great, it makes traps feel a lot more consistent.  But at this point, Traps are used offensively and not defensively, and I thought that's the purpose of a trap.  


Noone seems to be talking about them doing 150 damage anymore. But everyone agreed that that is way too much, as you are required to find a big shield potion to survive one trap.  
This would be fair if the traps would require as long to set up as they did in the past. However, they are able to set off within like 1 second? You basically don't even have time to place a ramp to build yourself out of the trap (unless you block the trap off, but then again you have one second to orient yourself perfectly)

There really is no counter play to traps once one is placed on your grid. It feels extremely unfair to die instantly with 2 mini shields and full health without time to react to it, and it feels unfair to kill someone nearly instantly if they manage to push into your box while you heal yourself.

Traps really need to be fixed. Either 100 damage like everyone suggested during the rebalancing, or more than one second of Setup time (as example the time it took back then on freshly placed wood, which was quick but not too quick)",FortNiteBR

If you place them against the walls behind where the doors open, enemies are practically forced to be fucked if they enter. There's a bunch of 1x1 rooms and you can bait people SO EASY. Just go outside shoot at random in sky or at an enemy. Make sure he catches you, fight back for like 2 seconds (Don't die) and run to your trap !

My Building is decent and fast(i know how to build fast 1x1s or double ramp wall push ppl) sometimes i do overbuild tho and get lost where the enemy is. I also try to edit everytime so my edit is pretty decent so far. My aiming is okayish but can still be improved a lot.

So everytime i play i try to accept every fight i can get and then look what i could do better. I mostly play Random Squads (i got no friends to play with)

Soo my question is what can i do to get better?

1. Is it better to just spam solos? is random squads bad?

2. Is it worth to drop tilted for like a week or something like that will i improve from that somehow?

3. Any tips or suggestions how to improve?

I am no god tier player but i know a lot from the game i watch a lot of youtube videos a lot of streamers to see how they play and how they handle certain situations and i try to get that into my gameplay which already helped me a lot.

**50v50**  


Half the Players jump like normal, the other half spawn as husks, and will spawn randomly at the beginning of the match.  


The entire match will take place at Night and it will be darker than normal.  


**The survivor objective is just to survive the 20 minutes** and then get to the Evac Zone. If there are humans alive after 20 Minutes they win.   


**Human players can always see the location of the next storm circle** on the map (Like the storm tracker backpack that released by mistake). The final circle is the Evac zone, and will be considerably smaller than the previous circle. When it shows up all the living players will rush to prepare a final defense before the location is revealed to the infected.  


**Human players that take lethal damage** will not be downed, but immediately die, switch teams, and spawn as a husk on the location of their death. Infected players that die respawn in a different location a few seconds later a few map tiles from the point where they were killed. There is no limit so the infected will not need to be cautious.  


**Infected will not take damage from the storm** and there is a **low chance for any infected team members to respawn as a Smasher**. Smashers have increased health and are immune to bounce traps. They are very good at making openings in the survivors defenses for the rest of the infected to exploit.  


**To win as the humans** your best bet would probably be not to call too much attention to yourselves. Gather supplies, and use traps to prevent the zombies from breaking your base. Collecting ammo, and weapons for everyone, and focusing Smashers when they come will be important to survive.  


**To win as the infected**, you'll want to kill as many humans as possible to bolster your numbers. Human players killed early in the game will likely be defenseless and will be easier prey. However humans killed later in the match may know where the Evac zone is located in advance, which will permit them to attack before their previous teammates defenses are complete.  


This is just kinda **rough** idea of something I'd really like to see. I'd like to see more holiday themed stuff impact the game play in general. Like our walls should be made of snow on Christmas or something.

I also blew up the last fort with my gun to win.

Since cellphone recordings are frowned upon, I'm gonna gloat the old fashioned way.

First off, I'm shit with shotguns. In my hands, they're a giant RNG cannon that rarely land in my favor. What I do to beat them is use SMGs!

SMGs, particularly silenced SMGs, in my opinion, are completely slept on. They get their shots off faster than any shotgun (obviously) and some well placed headshots will stun even the quickest double-pumpers. A blue Silenced SMG does 44 per head shot. Be patient, line up your shots, and the battle is won with three bullets.

""BuT OzZWaLd ThEy WoNt QuIt JuMpInG!?!?""

Okay, here's how you beat a shotgunner mashing X like a shitty Mario Party mini game. Pay attention now, because this is completely counter-intuitive: DON'T JUMP BACK.

Chances are they jumped and took a shot that they most likely missed because everyone they fight also jumps. That first shell just flew a foot over your head! If they are double pumping, that's one clean shot thay have to line up AFTER they land. If they aren't, thats one clear shot PLUS a pump animation. The SMG makes them your bitch.

""BuT tEh BuILdInGs r ToO fAsT fOr mE!""

You have a gun with one of the fastest fire rates in the game. Be quick, get under their ramp and shred it. In their confusion you can reload and shred them before taking too much retaliation.

""WhAt AbOuT dA fArT nOxXX dEy JuSt tUrBo BuILT!!!"" 

They built it in response to another fight. You were smart enough to read the circle, pick your spots, and get close without being noticed. All you have to do is clean up the poor bastard who had the low ground, find a hole at the bottom of the base and chill. When the time is right, shred the base from the bottom up, and a Victory Royale can literally fall into your lap.

1. Add more  heavy shotguns that you can find across the map.

2. Keep new players in a hidden matchmaking section till they get a win or something.

3. Get rid of bloom.

4. I wanna choose the default character that I want. Even though I have skins and battle pass sometimes i wanna choose the default skin that I want.

5. More materials please, the reason that I play Fortnite for is building. giving us less mats is changing the game to PUBG.

6. Give us a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, maps to play against friends, it might be great for tournaments and this why I can see Ninja vs Tofu in a 1v1 or faze vs whatever. That is more skill based match not playing against bots come on we wanna see challenge not who finds more bots.   

7. Stop changing the game every week. I played CSGO for one thing and it was its core mechanics. Fortnite is a great game I think changing it every update is gonna kill it.

8. having a casual mode might be great for bots, we don't need a ranking system in the game it self maybe as label on ur profile with how many wins or kills, but that's all, we don't need to separate the players that will lead to taking for ever to find a game.

9. Please fix the audio problems in the game, I keep restarting my game to fix that issue.

10. more customization for example main menu or more emotes to choose from at the lobby.

11. give us something for reaching level 100 

That's all what I can think of right now! let me know what do u guys think.

Automod has been either too powerful or too useless, completely ruining how posting works. The actual mods seem very biased when it comes to deleting posts, e.g. deleting screenshots of one persons things then allowing another persons screenshot to not be deleted. Another example of this would be how \[IMO\] posts get deleted for ""not encouraging discussion"" when obviously the topic of the post is to discuss something (such as ""Why isn't this weapon.."" or ""What do you guys think..""). 

Posts also get deleted for being duplicates even though multiple other people have posted the same exact thing without it being deleted. It's not adding onto an idea, it's a complete recreation of that. People trying to post that topic again have it deleted, but other people for some unknown reason can have it not deleted..? This applies to multiple other rules included.

Flairs are almost completely useless because half of the time the content you are trying to upload doesn't fall under any of the categories provided, and then your post gets deleted for that reason. Trying to decide whether my post falls under ""meme"" for being funny or ""creative"" for being worked on and then it getting deleted because I chose the wrong flair is ""unflair"", pun intended.

They are catering to new/casual players. One of the reasons this game is so addicting and replayable (for me at least) is because the skill cap is so high that it rewards players who utilize the game mechanics to create advantages. Nerfing shotguns and double pump? So now people who have mastered a difficult skill are put on a level playing field with tac shotguns and light machine gun spammers. Reduce my materials so i have to spend half a match breaking trees when im going for 10,15+ kill games? Adding shit like jet packs that let people just hold down a button and get above me with no skillful counter? (I know they removed it but not the point) at least the guided missile left the user vulnerable and was easily counterable by a skilled builder. or shopping carts that are so broken players are under the map....The only recent change im happy about is the rocket nerf. Takes 0 skill to spam grenade launchers or RPGs and im glad noobs cant use that. So many games ive been playing great and have a 1 v 2/3/4 and have a real shot at winning until limitless grenades come raining down. If building is a concern stop nerfing guns and that will limit fight times. Its better to make weapons strong and difficult to use over weak and based on luck. That way you have to be consistent and good to land your powerful shots. You have always been great about listening to your community, its time you start paying attention to your die hard fans. We pour our money and time into your game, its popular enough without pandering to noobs. Casual gamers have to learn a ton of skill to enjoy the game regardless, so focus on benefiting those of us who have already worked hard to get there Your grasp on the battle royale niche will start to fade as other companies continue to push out new versions that appeal to those of us who love the skilled competition.

You may be wondering how it is unplayable well for starters
- 1FPS when dropping and the following 
10 - 15 seconds following landing

- When In close proximity to other players  FPS will drop to 5 FPS or less

- When loading in to the game you will often load in, in the second due to the I seen load times

- Random Freezing 5 - 10 tines a game

And those are just the most prevalent issues so please EPIC I please on behalf of all Mac users PLEASE OPTIMISE THE GAME FOR MAC!

Many times you can land, and not find a gun, but you’ll find like 3-4 stacks of ammo before you find a gun.

To reduce the chance of getting killed because you had bad luck and didn’t find a gun, what if we took away ammo-only floor loot spawns, and increased spawn rate and spawns of ammo boxes? This way you’re not getting any less ammo, it incentivizes opening ammo boxes, and the chance of not finding a gun at the start is greatly reduced.

So, I came up with a configuration that I'm calling ""Edit Pro"" that will enhance editing as well make some improvements to Builder Pro.

When coming up with what was needed for this configuration, I looked at 3 things that made editing worse on Console compared to PC:

1. You have to hold down the Circle/B button in order to edit which means it takes longer to do than PC (although it may only be a few tenths of a second).
2. The button that is used to Edit is the same as the button used to pull out your Builds which means the Console has to try and differentiate between what action you are trying to do.
3. You have to take your thumb off the thumbstick in order to Edit which makes it difficult to be precise and efficient.

So here's my solution to all three problems; make the Edit action be pressing L1+R1 at the same time (or L2+R2, the option to choose which one would be great). The three problems stated before are suddenly solved. The only one that could potentially go wrong would be #2 but games that I've played such as Destiny seem to work flawlessly when using this combo so I see no reason as to why this won't work flawlessly with Fortnite as well.

Now since I'm changing this, I figured I might as well change a few other things as well to make it more polished.

1. Make the buttons to pull out your Builds be L2+R2 (or L1+R1, opposite of the Edit buttons), so that you also don't have to take your thumb off the thumbstick for that.
2. Change the 'Change Material/Trap' button from the left d-pad to circle/B since that button is now available and since left d-pad is just a horrible awkward button to press.

So, that is it! I think this configuration is one of the final steps that can be made to controller to get it as close to PC as possible and I would personally love to be able to make some quick edit plays. Thanks for reading :)",FortNiteBR

So Around 3 Weeks Ago I Had A Foot Injury And Left Work Early To Go To The Doctors Because The Pain Wasn’t LetWarehouseting Me Walk Mind That It Was A  Job. My Doctor Said It Maybe A Varicose Vein That Burst Or Maybe Just Swelling From The Pressure Of Standing All Day ( I Had A Ball On The Left Bottom Side Of My Foot ). She Recommended That I Got A Few Days Off Work To Let It Rest And So I Did. I Return To Work 2 Days Later And Everything Was Fine. That Same Week I Got The Pain Again And Since I Had A Follow Up With The Doctor I Left Work Early Once Again To Check Up On My Foot. She Prescribed An XRay/Ultrasound To See If It Might Be Something Else So I Left The Office With A Note To Take Another Two Days Off. Point Is I Turn In My Note At Work And They Said I Was Good And A Day Later They Called Me Saying Not To Return To Work. They Said My Main Manager Didn’t Like The Way I Worked Which Is BS Since I Technically Did His Job And The Supervisors Job While She Was On Vacation But Hey Everything Happens For A Reason. I Was The New Guy And All Of The Employees Would Come To Me For Help But In The End It Didn’t Matter. Back To Fortnite, I Love This Game And I Believe I’m Good At It. Yes I Play On Xbox And It Might Not Be A Big Deal But I’m Great At Building And Killing Along With Getting Dubs. With The Last Paycheck I Received I Invested In An Elgato And A Mic To Stream And Record. I Uploaded My First Official Video Three Weeks Ago And I So Far Have 160+ Views. My Goal Is To Try And Get Big Not Just For My Love Of The Game But Because It Will Help Big Time Financially. I Struggle Right Now And If It Weren’t For My Amazing GF I Don’t Know Where I Would Be.

Because it was fresh and a genre i hadn't played before. A month later i kind of stopped playing, not because it was boring but because i was busy playing other games.

And because of that i basically haven't Fortnite played during Season 2 and 3. Maybe 1 match a week. When Season 4 came out, i bought the BattlePass. I did realize that buying a BattlePass makes the game more fun, because you actually have to play to unlock.

Fast forward to end of Season 4 and i am now trying to get to level 80 for Omega. Which unfortunately, i wont reach. 

Not because its hard, but because at this moment, atleast for me. Fortnite is getting incredibly boring. At the beginning of S4 i could play few hours straight. Now, i play maybe one or two matches a day because it's really really boring. Every match feels the same, drop at a location, harvest and wait until the circle becomes smaller. I also dont feel excitement after a Victory Royale anymore. At the moment i have 32 Wins, which for some people isn't allot. But i did start learning how to build only in S4 etc so i think 32 wins is mediocre.

There is just no more excitement left in Fortnite for me. And all the LTMs, except Blitz are just incredibly lame. Final Fight... Really ? The game would've been more enjoyable if it wasn't made for little kids and college drop outs with all the time in the world. Make Fortnite fun and exciting again, do you remember your first ever win ? How amazing did that feel ? If you rack up your wins the game just gets boring. Hopefully Epic rewards players for winning, so people actually have a reason to win.",FortNiteBR

Yesterday, I previewed two emotes, the zany and red card. I was not thinking about purchasing these. I was not going to purchase these. I was just previewing them and spamming triangle to make them play over and over again. That's all that happened yesterday.  
  
  Now today, I got on, had my 850 Vbucks still and played a couple games. then got off to play some RL. Didn't go into the store at all just played. I got back on Fortnite to play with some friends and when I got into the lobby, my Vbucks had decreased to 150. Both Zany and Red card had been bought. Also my character had changed from Omega to The Reaper, (John Wick) which I don't play as and a back bling I don't use either.   
  
  Can I maybe get an explanation to what exactly happened? My account has not been put anywhere. I don't do ""free vbucks"" scams. Can I get a guess from someone or maybe and official answer? I know I can refund these, but at the same time I don't want to waste my refunds on something I never bought in the first place.",FortNiteBR

Cut forward a bit, landed Tomato and cleaned the place, walks up the stairs in tunnel and see someone chopping down the rock formations around the tree on top of the hill. I manage to get the high ground in the fight, I hear him drinking small pots, see a dark and purple figure inside the little wooden box, and BAM. I hear the whistle. It’s the same fucking Omega from spawn island and I felt really mean for trying to kill him. I pull out my pickaxe,  blow my whistle and leave. He didn’t shoot after me, no building, just went away to avoid further conflict. 

Cut to me being in 5th place, circle around Tomato and the nearby river, purple Omega is still alive and in the midst of a fight. Decided to help him out by sniping the dude in the back, 4 people left including me and whistle friend, one dies in the storm and Omega snipes the last one. We’re both a bit uncertain of what’s going to happen next, I blow my whistle and start spinning around, shooting with my sniper, a no-scope battle to settle the short friendship. He gets it and starts spinning aswell. At some point, he snapped and pulled out his shotgun after being hit down to white text damage, he builds up and pumps me in the face. As I see the #2 on my screen, he blows his whistle one last time and then I get put into lobby again.

I don't mind having to build walls for protection but what I have an issue with is being level 1-10 being smashed in with twitch streamers and players who have 100+ hours in the game already. It makes the game unenjoyable and unless I missed something there needs to be better balance.

I know no one is going to agree since this is the official Fortnite BR subreddit but I needed to say something. I've played around 10-20 rounds so far in Fortnite and it seems the only way to learn the game or become better at it, quickly, is to play with someone who's already kind of good at the game.

I like playing this with friends but I have the worst luck out of them all and am always the first to die. I think I've managed to kill 1 person in the entire time I've played - everyone feels like endless bullet sponges but I'm always dying to 1-2 shot kills no matter the weapon I'm using.",FortNiteBR

The max amount of XP you can get from kills is 170, since the game limits the amount of kills that register XP at 7. You can get more XP than that simply from placing third. This system is not rewarding and promotes camping.

My suggestion? Rework the system, and give us different amounts of XP for getting kills with different weapons/methods. This would allow us to get a different amount of XP depending on how skillful/hard to get a kill was.

I'd set it up like this:

* 100 XP for your first kill. After that:
* 30 XP for kills with any explosive weapon.
* 50 XP for kills with any shotgun, AR, or pistol (except for the deagle and revolver)
* 60 XP for kills with Deagles and Revolvers.
* 75 XP for kills with Sniper Rifles + Scoped ARs.
* 80 XP for kills with traps and great falls.
* 100 XP for kills with Harvesting Tools.

My first point is his insane accuracy and building he has crazy clips of shotgun flickshots
Double “tfue” ramping and sniper no scopes all while playing between a 9-10 sensitivity even seasoned pros with high sensitivity on console know how difficult this is.

My second point which is simply proof is if you look at some of his videos especially his most recent you will see that he is able to perform an emote without selecting it from the emote wheel while in game , this is impossible with a controller as there is no set “emote” button in game without having to select it from the wheel. This is however possible with a mouse and keyboard where you can bind the keys.

My thoughts are because of my gaming mouse broke and I'm using this small god awful mouse but my aim was still very good at the beginning when I got that mouse. Please, I just really need to know what is going on as it has made me rage SO MANY TIMES that I can't count.",FortNiteBR

I used to get outrageous whenever an update would roll in, but reading some comments and analyzing further made me realise that everyone is resistant to change and that no matter how previous months' updates seemed gamebreaking or would kill the game, people just got used to it and kept on playing.

I believe what Epic wants to do is reach a level where RNG in a BR game is as low as possible without ruining the BR concept, I also think this is aimed at making the competitive scene more skill based, and possible at all.

**Apples and Mushrooms**


You might be unlucky to not find shields or medkits when looting, or maybe just out of a fight losing half your health, and run into a 200hp enemy. These additions are good because no matter how unlucky you are, you will always know where in the map that 25 health worth of apples or that 40 shields are placed (90% of the time).

**Shopping Carts and jump pads**


Aside from being a fun item, you might find yourself stuck into a fight and losing track of storm timer, with the circle being very far, only to barely make it then die to people that the storm favoured, this implementation grants more mobility options other than the rarely found launch pads so people would cross areas quicker.

**Explosives nerf** 


Everyone should agree that GLs and RPGs are dominant in late game, and anything loot/weapon related is based on lucky chests or where supply drops land/contain. Limiting rockets to 12 not only will give people a chance to counter a person spamming grenades, but also the people wielding the GL will think twice before wasting rockets and will be smarter in using them, as they are more scarce to waste.

**Potential Materials nerf** 


This is where the community lashed out the most, now I love building and believe it is the core of fortnite, no buts. And thats why a dev said that building will not be touched. Capping mats at a lower number than 1000 might be beneficial though, you might get out of a build fight, wasting 80% of what you got, only to meet someone sitting in a base with 2500 mats to spare, luck. But if mats are nerfed to (My suggestion) 700,600,500 W/B/M respectivelly, not only will you be able to generate the max amount of mats possible in a shorter time (namely wood), you'll also disregard the fact that you meet someone having too many mats to go against, Also this WILL increase/retain skill levels/gaps, as it will counter turtling, AND make people come up with new strategies and build ideas that would necessarily use less mats. Everyone is the world evolves, and fortnite players are no different, limiting mats will within a week spark alot of new meta items that the rest of the community will quickly pick on.
Also Lamas will be more relevant again!


**Futur look**


**ARs Rework**


I am very certain that the way things are going, Epic will undoubtedly adress the bloom factor in ARs and reworkd them completely to make them skill reliant, where your crosshaiur/aim is where your shot would hit in a futur big update, I believe it is just a matter of time and that update would be the turning point and perhaps starting point to a clear competitive scene.

**building bugs**


These are also probably in the works, phasing through structures, not being able to build after tossing nades, ramps and walls placed further/closer than you are aiming and so forth should still be appealed by us and Im sure Epic willl fix them.


**Final note**


sorry for this rant, please be understanding and dont lash out instantly whenever something happens, look at the bigger picture and I believe the futur holds alot of promise for this game, lets just stand behind the devs as they havent messed up (alot) (Yet) and hope for the best! Thank you


tl:dr Epic's updates allll aim to reduce rng and emphasize having skills in this game, not luck.",FortNiteBR

The pump was the best gun in the game for 5 months and it was easily findable. it dictated all fights, and to not have one was an almost essential death sentence in close range gunfights. 

The material nerf would likely also be good for the game. nobody needs 3,000 mats. if you can’t win a fight without having to build a Taj Mahal, then maybe-just maybe, you’re not playing very smart. 

next time before you complain about this game, maybe realize that’s there is 20 different weapons in this game, but almost all of your fights end the same way. stop trying to force one play style on people in a fucking battle royale game. ",FortNiteBR

- Damage lowered to 85/95

- Reload speed buff to 3/2.7 s. 

- Vaulting Grenade launcher. 

- Add damage dropoff to RPG. Starting at 15m, damage is reduced by 10 every 10m. With the lowest possible damage being 50.

- Adding a short delay when switching from a Hand Cannon to an RPG or Pump shotgun and vice-versa. (This is to reduce the effectiveness of hand Cannon swapping to heavy hitting weapons like the RPG and Shotguns.) 

- Removing Crosshair from RPG. (This is to remove precision from RPG which can make it very easy to use.) 

-RPG will have durability that caps it at 10
shots and no rocket ammo will be available after that. The RPG will disappear from inventory. (This number could be changed over time to accommodate for other weapons introductions or feedback from the community 

-RPG Rarity will be downgraded to Rare and Epic to mirror effectiveness, not spawn rate. 


I do believe that these changes would make the RPG a viable weapon that would not be a huge problem and would allow gunplay and building to be more prevalent vs RPGs. These changes could also make the RPG feel less like an overpowered Missile and more like a grenade. ",FortNiteBR

This image is my opinion on what should be vaulted and unvaulted. Remember the original motto of Fortnite? ""The Battle Is Building""? We really need to bring that back.

I get it, different playstyles is a good thing, but stop giving them cheap ways to counter building.

Players should learn to build instead of having a cheap way out. Cmon guys, lets bring our favourite game back. Lets make fortnite fun again.

It made me want to focus on the game more since I actually spent money on it and yellow and green are some of my favorite colors so using the raptor is always a pleasure for me.

36,ExpStealer,1549390668,angxx6,37,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/angxx6/fortnite_is_oversaturated_with_building_mobility/,1,"Fortnite is oversaturated with building, mobility and loot","Basically, it's entering that deadly cycle of buffing existing content, or creating new content, to counter older content/mechanics and then buffing the latter as ""compensation"" instead of removing/hard nerfing stuff. As a result the game is no longer a Battle Royale, it has turned into a 100 man deathmatch, which has *nothing* to do with survival. Before disagreeing let me explain:

1. **Building has spiraled out of control over the years**  
Building is a unique, core mechanic for Fortnite. However, it was designed for Save the World, not Battle Royale - thus, we're using a PvE system in a PvP environment. Combine this with average player skill increase over the seasons and we end up with what we have today - a place where you either spam build or get owned. Building is a core mechanic, I get it, but that doesn't mean it has to be the only way to win (unless you're playing at the bottom of the skill spectrum, that is). Those who can't build (or, like me, simply don't enjoy that part of the game and choose not to build) shouldn't be left in the dust. However, it isn't the mechanic itself, which is the problem here - it's the amount of resources we're allowed to carry. Triple 999 is way too high for a survival game in general. IMO it should be something like triple 100 or less. Right now you can reach insane amounts easily and that's where balance is completely lost. If you're severely limited in how much you can carry/farm then you'll think twice before spamming ramps and walls all around someone, to the extent even a legendary SMG spraying from close range can't stop you (that did happen to me btw). Building has always been intended to be used as a tool to create a **Fort**, hence the name - **Fort**nite. Also, outplaying someone with limited resources would feel a lot more satisfying than just racing up towards the skies to see who's gonna outbuild whom along the way. I'm sure everyone hates it when you try to shoot at someone from over 100 m and they just begin to build a skyscraper, whether out of panic or habit.  

2. **Mobility is so far gone that the storm timer is basically irrelevant until very late**  
When I first began playing Fortnite a few seasons ago (Season 4 to be specific) there was no mobility, save for Launch Pads. Now we have Gliders, Planes, Quadcrashers, Shopping Carts, Rifts, Zip Lines, etc. It's way too much. If before I had to worry about not spending too much time looting outside the safe zone so I don't get killed by the storm when it closes in - now I just couldn't care less. It's no longer a threat, just an annoying purple zone with little meaning, other than limiting me to stay in a certain part of the island. And not only this - with Gliders, Planes and Rifts you even have to worry about getting collapsed on from above, wave after wave after wave, until you run out of meds or time and inevitably die. Collapses, which happen at little to no rist for your opponents in most cases. Planes in particularly added the most toxic strat there ever was in a Battle Royale - circling around, dropping on a target, killing them and taking to the skies again. You'd say just blow them out of the sky, but good luck doing that by yourself against even a half-decent pilot - you'd probably get eradicated by their gunfire first. The only case where you can't even spam build to protect yourself I can think of (other than getting RPG/Turret spammed by multiple people).  

3. **Basically unlimited loot in a game where it should be heavily limited (and almost pointless rarity)**  
Let's leave loot lying around everywhere and add plenty of chests to that. What could possibly go wrong? Getting 2 legendaries and several epics with hundreds of ammo just from my starting location, that's what. Is a legendary that rare if you get two in the first 3 minutes of dropping on the island? No. Are rare+ items really rare if 9 out of 10 people you kill have at least one or two of them even early on? No. Do you really feel like you're trying to survive instead of playing a deathmatch if you have hundreds of ammo and an inventory full of weapons and other items? Is it ever risky to jump on people because you have a limited supply of medkits, shields, ammo and resources? No, it isn't. This is the biggest spoilsport of all in this game. This is the main reason why people loved the Ground Game LTM - pretty sure not only because it brought the OGs closer to the first few seasons. It finally forced players to play smart instead of full-on brute force (or brute-build?) mode in respect to their almost non-existent resources, even if ammo was largely still not limited (200-something medium bullets is still a pointlessly high limit). What I say is limit:  
\- Small Bullets to 160  
\- Medium Bullets to 100  
\- Large Bullets to 14  
\- Shotgun Shells to 16  
\- Rockets to 6  
\- Grenades and Small Shields to 3 and 4, respectively (dropping 1 and 2 at a time)  
\- Large Shields to 2  
\- Medkits to 1  
\- Bandages to 6 (also dropping 2 at a time)  
\- Sneaky Snowmen, Rift-to-Gos, Port-a-Forts and similar items, to 1 (also dropping 1 at a time)  
\- All kinds of traps to dropping 1 at a time and limit to carrying only 1 Turret (ideally Turrets wouldn't even be in the game since nobody seems to use them unlike, you know, *Heavy Shotguns and non-silenced Bolt Snipers)*  
Basically the carrying capacity for everything, as well as drop amounts, have to be drastically limited (harder than in Ground Game) so you actually have to play smart and not just deathmatch like. Otherwise the whole survival wibe is just non-existent.

If you feel it’s unbalanced/unfair, what changes would you make?

How many people are playing with a controller on pc? 

Also what’s your opinion on the advantages that pc has over console, such as higher FPS and more keys to bind?

My opinion on the subject is I can see how it’s unbalanced in a few aspects of the game but I don’t think it’s as big as people make it out to be. You shouldn’t get aim assist help when your opponent is covered by smoke. The aim assist shouldn’t pull toward your opponent’s head. I think it should pull towards the center of the body but there should be some adjustments and exceptions. For example if you are already aiming in the head region the aim assist should be tapered down to not mess with headshot accuracy. 

I’ve never spammed LT, just seems like it would be inconsistent with your screen zooming in and out multiple times but at the same time in close quarters situations I can see how a controller player would use aim assist to its fullest potential to try to make up for the lack of control of their aim when how fast they need to move their aim varies. I believe it’s much easier to control the speed and accuracy with a mouse than a joystick. 

Last thought, Epic needs to create a dedicated game mode or environment for competitive players. That’s where these concerns and fixes should be addressed. At this point I’m tired of any time I play cross platform that I have to play at a disadvantage to a keyboard and mouse player, I don’t want one more thing. I can’t be the only one that just wants to play for fun and not have to worry about making adjustments all the time. I feel as epic is treating the Fortnite community like there’s a one solution to fix everyone’s problem. When in reality a competitive players are going to want everything to be even, average everyday players are going to want to just play and have fun, content creators are going to want new game modes and other changes to keep the game fresh, and so on and so further. Thank you for your time if you paid any mind to my ranting and rambling. ",FortNiteBR

68,XIST-R-2-S,1549384806,anfw41,29,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/anfw41/siphon_nostalgia/,1,Siphon = Nostalgia,"First of all I want to preface this by saying I still enjoy the game, and I don’t think it’s in a bad place right now.  This is merely a suggestion to give us back that OG Fortnite feeling.

Now when I first started playing Fortnite it felt different, it truly felt like it was 1v99 and if you were seen, then that’s it you were eliminated.  My senses were all amped up and i was literally nervous in games.  Nowadays we drop in and have no fear-especially if we have shields.  If we start getting shot at-that’s fine I’ll build a little 1x1 and pop a couple minis, or big pots.  

That brings up my next point.  I think getting rid of shields entirely and creating a siphon style of game where you can only get shield from kills or mushrooms is the best way to bring back that original Battle Royale feeling.  It will reward those who play smart, and tactically (like a BR should be played) while still allowing players to be aggressive.  Even in solos the amount of available shields almost turns this game into a respawn mode.  If you get tagged a bunch you just glide away and heal up to full health.  That’s how an arcade shooter is played not a BR and I think siphon fixes that.

And even if you didnt play when they got introduced, it's been 3 more seasons since.

My suggestion is atleast once a season or possibly every 15 wins we could get a free refund?

or possibly in the Battle Pass we could have a slot, such as for example one of the emoticon slots because nobody really uses them, replace a few with some Refund slots.

I think that they’re too OP and I wanted to discuss why.,"Balloons and planes are super OP because they are extremely difficult to deal with when you’re being third partied by a solo/team. 

They’re really easy to deal with in a 1v1 setting; however, I don’t care how good you are if you are being third partied by balloons it’s unfair because you can’t hear them approaching. 

When you’re being third partied by someone who’s running up or building up to you. If you can hear them it gives you a fighting chance because you can start to factor them into your fight and figure out the best way to deal with it. 

I’ve been in so many situations where I’m fighting a team in solo v squads and I’m keeping track of everyone then boom out of nowhere someone with a balloon catches me off guard because I couldn’t hear them approach me. If I’m being third partied by someone running up to me or building up to me I can always hear them, but when you’re ballooning you can cover a lot of distance quickly and silently which is way to op when players are constantly being third partied. 

I’m not bitching about third parting though I love it and I love the pressure it puts me under, but it’s way to unfair for the player in the middle of the two parties when one player literally appears out of nowhere because it takes the skill aspect out of it. I need a way to counter it. I’m not saying you should take balloons out but I’m saying they need to be way louder. Or they could also implement some kind of sonar system where if your ballooning you pop up on the mini map every few seconds. That way I can always have a fighting chance against any type of third party situation where I literally have no way of winning if I can’t counter someone using aerial weapons . ",FortNiteBR

Are u freaking kidding me? WTH ""Delhi rights pannel""?! More like Delhi assholes' pannel... Lemme get this shit straight... The fucking dickheads who reviewed the games is a dumb ass cause GOW is clearly a single-player only AAA title. Moreover it's a sensational game, with so much character building, jaw dropping story and it also has multitude of moral lesson which can never be taught to someone through books... Let's talk about harmfulness... It's clear that the present, oh so trusted,  education system is undoubtedly responsible of severe depressions of young minds. Battle royale games like PUBG and Fortnite are extremely good stress busters since the excitement of outsmarting someone with one's own merit is a joy beyond compare. I've heard many people say that playing video games reduces grades... But those people fail to understand that what students are forced to study, rather mug up, are fact... No moral lessons, no practical situations, no social interactions. Neither are they taught the power of team work. I can most certainly confirm that there are no sandbox elements at all in our education system, which is essential for a developing mind. This unethical concept of banning something popular just because some old orthodox geezers did not understand the value of something can be traced long back in India's history (after Independence). The mere estimation that something is not good for someone by another totally different individual/group of individuals who have very less knowledge or rather no knowledge at all is bullshit.

I never used it or practiced with it because i never needed it. Just the initial ADS to start shooting. I don't spam the left trigger like a NooB. Anyways, I think that the aiming for a PC is much quicker. The console aim uses a thumb and the aim for a PC, you can use your while arm and I noticed about 1/2 second difference is reaction time. If you're a regular player to FPS game you will know that 1/2 a second makes a big differnce. And what about the edits? I would like to go prop but we have a system tjat just makes it to OP to even battle agasint. First time I knew I was playing a PC player was when i noticed how quick they can edit on cross servers. I never came across anyone tjat can build and edit that quick. It's bad enough you took out some damage for the shotguns but to give an advantage to other players on different platforms is not even fair. Not even close. Pc should stay on its own platform.

The game mode would consist of the normal modes with a twist. If you are knocked and your team revives you before you bleed out you still get to play. However, you will drop all your loot after revival and lose one inventory space forcing you to prioritize items. 

I personally think it would be fun to allow knocks until a player only has a pickaxe and builds, any following knocks would be an insta elimination. (Yes I know how unlikely this is)

Other ideas:
Another addition could be nerfed mats and limited ammo corresponding to knocks. Possibly no rpgs or gls to promote competitive non spammy encounters.
After being knocked be forced to used a set standard inventory of grey weapons.

As a pc player, i shouldn't have to deal with aim assist, but epic decided to make it so controller players can play on kb + mouse servers. This is a problem. You shouldn't be able to switch to controller mid  fight, and aim assist spam, get very accurate aim, then switch back to keyboard and mouse.
An example of this: you land in clock tower in tilted, and get a scoped ar. Someone landed next to you in Cs. Instead of aiming with your mouse you switch to a controller, and spam aim assist.
Another problem with this is that players could setup macros for their aim button, and literally never miss. (This is possible on console aswell)

Ways to fix this:

1) Make it so if someone uses a controller, they cant switch back to kb+m

2) Queue players with a kb+m, and controller connected with each other. 

3) Add a delay to aim assist, or reduce aim assist.

Now we have today's shop and there's a ""Rare"" (what makes it rare, I don't know) wrap for $6, which is ridiculous. How much are they going to charge for Epic and Legendary wraps? 

By purchasing this weapon wrap, you're telling Epic it's fine to charge this much, and they'll likely go ahead and bring out even more expensive wraps in the future, knowing people will buy them.

Whenever a really bad bug on PC happens, Epic jumps right to it. Double pump is back? FIXED! Some item shop glitch? FIXED! But actual optimization? Why, of course not. Because Epic doesn’t give a banana for Switch players, and I’m sick of it. 

So I’m quitting. The game’s not fun, it’s unplayable in certain scenarios, and it’s not fair to have to compete against Xbox and PS4 players who have so much better circumstances than we do. 

Your loss, Epic. If you’re not going to improve your game, I’m not going to play it. I’m going to go play games that the Switch is meant to play. Not your crappy cash grab.  

P.S. Don’t tell me that the Switch can’t handle Fortnite well, because the Switch port was JUST FINE when it first came out. It even had replay, for pity’s sake. ",FortNiteBR

He's honest when I ask him why he doesn't like it, and it's literally just ""Because I'm bad at it."" 

But when I asked him what he does like about Fortnite he was a little lost for words and eventually decided on ""Winning games."" 

What is there in Fortnite that draws people in besides the (imho) entirely unique building mechanics that add an entire new dimension to fights. That seems to be my only real reason for liking this game so much. 

Nothing against anti-builders of course. If you can win without it more power to you, I just can't really imagine what else about this game is appealing. Most of this game would be entirely too frustrating to me without builds, I dread the idea of having a GL spammed at me and not having the ability to wall it off, this game would be infuriating without builds to me.

You may remember in a previous post when I [updated the flairs](https://redd.it/a920cb) because we were missing a lot. I've been keeping them updated as skins come out, so we shouldn't be missing any skins (variants don't count).

Around the same time [I updated the flair system on the STW sub](https://redd.it/abn3xq) to also include the flair pictures on reddit redesign (to kind of match old reddit). The difference between the two was STW had a lot less flairs, and because of such we didn't hit the ""emoji"" limit when uploading them all.

Due to the limit, I did not want to implement the ""new"" system on here and have some flairs not include their image.

Our limitations have been increased, thus I've implemented the system.

[Demo](https://i.imgur.com/cp8autR.gif)

**Sadly, you will have to manually pick a flair to get the image to appear**.

Reddit's flair system is... interesting to say the least. If we make a tweak to a flair it doesn't update globally, so the end user (you, the person reading this) must update it on their own.

why cant we atleast have 3 graphics settings on console?

2. 60 (doesn't go below 35 in tilted)

3. 40 (higher graphics) (doesn't go below 15 in tilted)

+ give us an option to remove shadows.

Orrr yo could actually give us the same custom settings option that pc fortnite has.
 
I really don't see a problem with wanting to change yours settings to fit your gameplay and I think it would make it easier for everyone

Please do t just remove the post I want to know why can't we have the same things on console, the fact that we don't have this option puts us in a big disadvantage and is really unfair

I came here today to just ask the devs if there could maybe be a nerf to either building health or something around building so it makes it a bit more obsolete. I've been playing this game since around mid season 1 to beginning of season 2, so I remember the old days where we were all a bunch of bots roaming around not even thinking about building that much. Now as time progressed, building became the most known thing around this game and many buffs and nerfs were applied to builds. I followed along in these patterns and got decent at building and aiming to compete against higher level players. Now these past couple of weeks I tried to play and im always getting into fights where players never actually attack me, but rather waste all their mats trying to get high ground on me and end up either running out, dying to me, or falling to their deaths. Now I know this sounds more like a flex than a ""complaint"", and I see why some might say that building and fighting are balanced, but it gets annoying when you have to run around using a deagle to get into people's builds because their best tactic is to box themselves in. Sorry for the rant, but please devs, if you see this, take this change into consideration.

Thanks so much,

Cumulonymbus",FortNiteBR

The tac is no longer viable because of the o.p as hell pump shotgun. No don't nerf the pump the pump is balanced but it makes the tac look like a throwaway weapon and no one is using it. it has gotten to the point that tac shotgun players are put at a disadvantage due to how strong pump is.

  
The Tac Is Utter Garbage...

The tac needs to be buffed. Here are my suggestions. Make the tac do 79 damage for the grey. This would help with actually hurting someone when you have good enough aim to hit a full body shot. The headshot multiplier needs to be 2.2 which would make the grey tac to 173 instead of some retarded 130. The green tac should be 85 damage which would be 187  to the head with the 2.2 multipliers and the blue tac needs to be 87 damage for the body with 191 with the headshot multiplier. To make this o.p shot auto firing beast from semi-close range but instead make the tac more close. No not double barrel level close range but something like you have to be within 1.2 built floor tiles from the person",FortNiteBR

I’m a Portuguese Fortnite player and as so, when I join a fill squads game, I get matched up with other European players. The thing is, most of the time I get matched up with players from France, Spain or Italy who don’t speak English. 

Although I speak a little bit of this 3 languages, I speak some pretty good English, and as so I would really appreciate if there was an option that makes so I only get matched up with other English speakers, and not with some random French dude.

It would be a setting in which I would only activate Portuguese and English, which would increase a lot the quality of fill squads and duos games.

Its like for a brief moment I was in the future and now im back in the present and I feel a little sad.,"Not to be too mellodramatic (pun life) but I feel like I'm missing something.  

TBH I didn't think it would be very good.  I thought it would be a cringe fest but very quickly after it started I realized how unique and profound this was.  

The bouncing, flying, floating, was unexpected and made such a huge impact. 

The synchronized cuddle team leaders were out of this world!  Any concert that doesn't have perfectly synchronized giant holographic cuddle team leaders will pale in comparison now. The fact that you could recognize their movements from the root emotes but that they were being applied in such an amazing way was even more profound.

Then the music.  Could not have named a single Marshmello song before.  But now I can't keep them out of my head.  I had to buy a few of his albums.  I've binge watched the videos of the events and now feel like I have seen everything there was to see and hear. 

Btw - I didn't know this but courage and Marshmello actually got in into a game between the two sets and played a number of games. And even won.  It wasn't very well published or known about so I don't think it had a lot of viewers but it could have easily been a massive stream if they had done a better job of letting people know. If Ninja had been the one it would have been a record breaker for sure. 

Anyways -was just wondering if others felt the same way about the event and had a similar sense of sadness that it was over.

I think epic should take a look at this,so that players are more evenly spread across the map. Making battle bus faster was a nice change but didn't impact that much.

I think diving should be made faster too..so that when players can dive and go to a farther location than the battle bus route much faster,people only dive near the battle bus route because going to farther location took ages..so in my opinion this change might impact more.

Controller and M&amp;K each have parts where they are good in (M&amp;K undeniably has a lot more). 

You guys als have to think about the disadvantages a controller has (no real hotkeys, only a thumb stick that you can move maybe up to 2 cm in radius etc.).
So why are you just bitching about the ONE advantage a controller player has compared to the many disadvantages?

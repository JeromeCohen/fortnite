Well, I'd like to suggest a local split-screen option, which works for Duos and Squads (and other modes that aren't solo). Player 2 logs in using their information after selecting the Battle Royale option on the main menu. Teaming up co-op stylez. Amazing for creative, fantastic for Battle Royale.  


So a few things, 

&amp;#x200B;

1) I know the editing is complete trash, and one is console, one is PC. I just found two random pictures online.

2) Yes, the black box with the line in the middle is meant to be a TV screen.  
3) Maybe put the building bar, and the weapons above the health and shield gauges  
4) Keep the maps on their respective sides  
4) Obviously make it freaking fit well and each screen properly sized.  
5) I listed ""4"" twice and am too lazy to fix it.  


  
Of course this will be exclusive to consoles, and I suppose PC (even though not many PC games do Split-Screen anymore, AFAIK...?) and not mobile.  


But I keep thinking how I would LOVE this feature, and I'm sure it had been suggested before.  


Think we can make this happen, Reddit?",FortNiteBR

Bounce pads were super good and I don’t get why no one said they were op until AFTER they were vaulted. Just face it they weren’t broken but could’ve had slight changes in the way they dropped around the map

Drum Gun was broken and needed a huge nerf to magazine, damage to walls, DPS, and fire rate but had amazing sound and feel (once again yes I know it needed nerfed)

LMG should’ve had its clip sized halved, less damage to builds and a DPS buff. I think at least

They fucked up the way your character peeks over top builds too, no one ever mentions this but you have to put like 2/3 your body up over a wall to not even get a red X

Double Pump in S4 was absolutely fine and balanced, matter of fact Pump + SMG was actually broken back then but no one complained. People just got shit on by someone with good aim and bitched it’s OP but now are the same ones claiming planes and RPGs arent 

Tac-SMG was again like the drum gun, needed a nerf but was just a more satisfying gun and had better sounds

Impulses felt skilled but then they for some reason added shockwaves then vaulted it for chiller grenades? Don’t know why almost every new addition is a reiteration of the last one but better (example, heavy sniper) and why they thought chiller grenades would be cool after no one liked chillers 


Maybe I’m just nostalgic somehow cause it was summer but I felt like S4-S5 would’ve been perfect Fortnite with just balance changes and other types of changes.

I had much more fun playing 6 hours a day being SMG spammed than I do being rammed by 6 planes at once, and either way with the update tomorrow people will still just fly over top and jump out the plane to third party. It won’t stop third partying issues just them ramming first.

And cmon let’s be real, with the update tomorrow we all know there’ll be some sword v2 or nuclear warhead coming out in season 8. It always works this way that they start doing what we’ve been saying then say fuck all and drop another broken ass meta ",FortNiteBR

Can’t even watch them play anymore because it’s constant complaining about how fortnite isn’t doing something right. Many people who I know have stopped playing the game because it turned into trash. That was like 6 months ago. The complaining has seemed to increase with the rise of apex. And I think it’s shitty that players are trashing apex because they still play fortnite. Apex is new and fresh and definitely has more potential to be a better competitive game. At least competitive in apex won’t have 30 people sitting in 1x1s all game and then trying to turtle for the last 3 circles, which is why lots of people stopped watch competitive fortnite. Fortnite Friday’s is what got fortnite insanely popular and after that was over many people weren’t interested anymore. Epic seems like they have been in over their heads for most of the games life and it seems like they will be struggling to stay afloat now with the rise of apex. Like many brs they have a lifespan and people will move on to the new br.

After shooting one pump, and then the other, you should have to pump both shotguns before you are able to ""double pump"" again.  I think this would be an awesome and balanced way to bring it back!

Everyone have their own way of enjoying the game, some people enjoy it by trolling people and some people enjoy it by playing by going for kills/wins.

TTV's are just people trying to grow their channel, seeing someone with TTV in their name doesn't mean they are toxic. Tfue and many other big streamers used to have TTV in their name. It's hard to grow a small channel.

Since they are mostly only play „competitive“ and almost no public games anymore, they automatically win less games and start to exploit every little detail, that is trash about the game. 
Are streamers and pro players just so spoiled of winning almost every public lobby that they can’t deal with the fact that they more often die in pop ups?

While the post is somewhat on point about the way things are at the moment, there is absolutely no reason why EPIC couldn't please both crowds with a simple system that lets you choose between a list of chores and more advanced skill based Challenges on weekly basis. Perhaps even let you choose individual Challenges from both lists to complete.

Right noq, they are alienating people from buying the pass who are simply tired of doing the dishes (chores). That's not smart business practice, especially when we are talking about a part of the main monetization system.

I am a (New) PC player who has played console Fortnite since the beginning. I like to play with my 8 year old little cousin who plays on the switch. When we play duos we like to be identical skins. Wolfgang (Dire) Catgang (Lynx) Bot gang (Skull trooper) and others. That was just for perspective. 

Anyways, I was was thinking while playing solos about how much the vocal minority of “OG” players are stopping people from getting their “OG” Skins. (Not talking battle pass because im not a fucking psychopath) I own every Christmas skin except for crackabella since I didn’t have any vbucks at the time. 

Does anyone here *actually* care if they bring it back? Like take this into consideration: 

Nintendo switch Fortnite didn’t come out until season 5. 

I’m just saying the codename elf was in the trailer for season 7 and it would be a shame if people who didn’t get a chance to last year wouldn’t get the chance to enjoy a skin. 

Also, ELF is literally my main skin so don’t say I would stop using him cuz I won’t. Even after they re release (If they do) 


Tl;dr: Give the people who were physically unable to play Fortnite a chance instead of listening to a vocal minority that is really toxic. ",FortNiteBR

But fortnite I get killed all the time, I got as much as 15 kills as my highest game.  But lately everyone I run in to has been hitting me with near 100% accuracy and this has been going on for several weeks.  


Here's the rundown on why this is a trash game, at least half the time you will get hit from a shot that you don't see coming, can't have 360 degree vision, or you will get one shotted with bunny hopping twitch reflex kids with a shotgun.  The only skill I've seen in this game has to do with building, but now everyone is a pro builder so that is a completely frivolous skill.  After playing for a while I've noticed that this game relies less on skill and more on twitch reflexes and quickness of hands.  There is very little learning curve involved at this point.  All there is is, who can build this quick, who can edit this quick, who can shoot quick and with accuracy, there is absolutely no thinking involved in this game.  That's probably why all these 10 year olds are getting good at this game.  


Here's an example of a shooter that's not completely garbage, and this is still a shooter which means it's based on randomness and luck.  Ok in The last Of Us, if you run in to someone, there's certain movements you can do depending on your opponents weapon of choice in order to avoid his shots, and also depending on your weapon of choice.  This is all in the heat of the moment and requires quickness but also requires thinking.  In Fortnite there's not a lot of predicting, but more just quick shooting or building, there's not really any thought at all when it comes to battle, it's all just bitch reflexes and muscle memory.  TLOU is a weak example but it's still a far superior shooter than fortnite, although it has a lot of problems too.",FortNiteBR

Most players beleave that thisting should be somehow prevented while other players (myself mostly)  beleave it is a part of the game that we should learn to live with.  However I beleave the mechanic should be changed in a few ways.  Not to prevent thirsting but to give teammates a chance to kill the enemy team and pick you up before getting killed.  Basically what I want to stop is when players will target the person they knock while in a fight with youre teammates

My Solution: I do not want the ablity to kill a downed player removed.  Its a part of the game.  But I think it should be changed to allow your team to pick you up.  To do this I would reccomend once a player is downed they cannot be damaged by other players for..  10 seconds?  Not sure for a good immunity time but I think this would be a good,  simple change that would make both sides of this argument happy.

Fortnite's main appeal in the first place was that it was a fun and casual battle royale that was also a viable competitive game, but it's really lost that casual aspect to it which is what's driving a lot of it's playerbase away. It's annoying how all the try-hards are just completely incapable of adapting to new changes that keep the game fresh, and demand that the game stays the same as how it always was because *that's* what they're good at, because they can't for whatever reason learn how to use new items or mechanics instead of demanding that they be immediately vaulted or nerfed to shit. I had really high hopes for season 7 because the first couple days were the most fun I'd had in the game ever, but it just got worse and worse after every patch because Epic kept on caving in to the needs of the super competitive players, leaving everyone else less interested as the game was getting stale due to this. Planes aren't OP. There's only like 15 of them on the map, and can be easily shot down and heard from miles away, but this aspect wasn't part of these competitive player's playstyles, so instead of learning how to counter planes they just complained about them until Epic made them completely useless. Same thing with deagles. The fact that they broke wood walls added an extra layer of tension and strategy to fights. All people had to do was learn to use a different material if they're going against somoene with a deagle, but that was too much to ask for so that too had to be nerfed. Guided missiles as well were a really fun addition to the game, and especially after they got a (*well-deserved in this case)* nerf, they were fairly balanced too. They didn't travel or turn too fast, and didn't do too much damage, but were still viable weapons that were fun to use and mess around with, but since people didn't understand how to use them they were forced to be vaulted. The reason Fortnite became so popular and has been alive for this long is due to the fact that Epic was constantly adding new and exciting changes, but at this point in it's lifespan those changes are immediately ridiculed until they're removed or nerfed, which in turn is causing the game to remain the same, sweaty game that it is. A lot of the people in the community also hold annoying double standards, where they'll say something is awful, and then when it gets removed they complain about how it's removed and how they want it back. A prime example of this was the double pump. Anyways, thats all I have to say. Props to you if you read the whole thing.  


**tl;dr:**

Fortnite giving in to the needs of competitive players who don't want to adapt to new changes is whats making the game stale and no longer fun.",FortNiteBR

My suggestion: add a delay to building a friendly structure if it has been destroyed recently in that spot. (Wall destroyed, owner of that wall can’t build that specific wall for X seconds)

This is totally reasonable as these are sold under the impression that they will be exclusive to the season. This is different from item shop items that people complain about coming back.

(Sorry about any bad formatting or grammar errors!)

I have many reasons to believe that at some point there will be a way to obtain old battlepass items again. And if they were to come back I have some ideas of how it could work. So I’ll start with why I believe battlepass items will return in the future.

As of right now battlepass items cannot be obtained after the season ends. Once it’s over the next season starts and the old stuff is unobtainable. The battlepass costs 10 dollars or 950 vbucks to be exact. When a new season comes out Epic no doubt gets tons of money from purchases of the battlepass from people coming back to the game for the new season and those who didn’t save their vbucks for the next season battlepass. The issue with this is when a season ends all the items in the pass can no longer make any money. This leaves tons and tons of emotes and skins and various cosmetics locked for anyone who didn’t play or complete the battlepass. There a total of about 364 items from battlepasses season 2-6. (This number should not be taken as fact. There are likely some mistakes when counting but overall it should be relatively accurate).     
This is a total of :     
34 skins     
23 emotes     
17 gliders     
20 contrails     
21 backblings     
17 pickaxes     
232 emoticons, music, loading screens, toys, etc.     

This may not seem like a lot of stuff. But these items will never return according Epic and this number will only grow as the seasons progress. Many of these are highly sought after items, stuff like the Reaper skin, Omega’s lights, Sparkle Specialist, and Black Knight. 

If Epic were to release these skins again they would obviously make tons of money. These are cosmetics that a vast majority of Fortnite’s player base would want. So keeping these skins exclusive to a certain time never to come back isn’t a great deal for Epic. 



Now I’ll suggest a possible way these skins and items could be rereleased for minimal opposition. I feel the worst way to bring old battlepass skins back would be in the shop, this would not go over well with players and would not be good. Now there would be players upset with battlepass items being available again but I’ll address this soon.

My personal favorite way to possibly bring back old battlepass items. Allow players to purchase access to the old passes separately. For example if it’s season 7, I can buy the season seven battlepass but also purchase access to any other season battlepass for 950 vbucks. Each purchase of a battlepass would cost 950 vbucks. These battlepasses don’t expire after a certain time so if I buy access to the season 4 battlepass in season 7, it will carry over into season 8. The current season battlepass access will not carry over. So for example if I’m tier 57 in season 7 and season 8 starts, in order to access season 7 again I need to put in another 950 vbucks.

After buying access to a season you can work on challenges from only one season at a time. So if I buy season 8 I can’t work on my season 3 access until I reach tier 100 in season 8. 

Also, any battlepass that isn’t the current season will not supply vbucks. So you can just get all the passes with no downside of vbucks. These cost vbucks that aren’t given back.

So obviously how would challenged work. As some items aren’t in the game and there are many changed locations. I’m not exactly sure how this would work. I feel a great way would be daily challenges and level ups. Also maybe generic challenges like kill enemies and play games. Things like that. 

Challenges for skins would be the same as before. For example buying access to the season 4 battlepass would unlock the Omega challenges again, allowing players to get max Omega. 



So why should this happen? Wouldn’t it take away the point of playing the battlepass and getting to tier 100? This would take away from us OGs that have Black Knight and us that grinded to get max Omega before the season ended!

Well would this take away from getting to tier 100? Not in my opinion. The reason I argue it doesn’t it because it’s shouldn’t be the time frame a person got to tier 100, it’s the fact that they did anyway. Even with old passes coming back it’s not like you just bought the Reaper from the shop. You still need to level up to unlock him. It’s just there is no longer an arbitrary time limit. In exchange it takes longer to level up the pass and is more expensive for the player.

For “*OG*”players I could see people being upset about these coming back. My counter is that players with these skins have had access to them for a long time. It’s not going to take away from a skin to have more people using it. It’s a skin. People will still need to work to unlock them. It’s not like they are being put in a shop for 2000 vbucks. 

Lastly about Omega and other challenges things. Similar to my other point, who cares about the time frame you got max Omega. The accomplishment is getting there not the arbitrary time limit in doing it. In order to get max Omega players will still need to get the xp original players did in season 4. It’s still hard, it just doesn’t have the arbitrary time limit associated with it. And anyway, since season 5 players can level up tier based skins past the original season, so there is no reason for Omega to be different in that regard.



So that’s why I think battlepass items will eventually return. These are items many players want and would gladly pay for. And I feel my idea for how to bring these items back is very fair and generous to people that already had the items. I appreciate any feedback or ideas that other people have, and if you made it this far thanks for reading!

[The Meteor](https://i.redd.it/jbrq65idvzf21.jpg)

Season 3: During some time in Season 3, a Meteor was spotted in the sky North-East of the Fortnite Island, as time wen't on Players started realizing that the Meteor was getting closer every day little by little, eventually Small Meteorite started to hit the Island causing any structure to break down that it hit.  


[The Visitor](https://i.redd.it/ks0wqtmovzf21.jpg)

Season 4: Season 4 Launch Trailer revealed that the Meteor finally struck the Fortnite Island hitting Dusty Depot turning it into what it is today, Dusty Divot, after the update went live Players noticed small glowing rocks in the Diviot, Also known as Hop Rock, once one of these Rocks were consumed it gave the Player the ability to have low gravity effects on them, as the Season went on the Meteor in Dusty Divot started to crack over eventually revealing a extra territorial also known as The Visitor, no one knows what The Visitors Intentions were, as the season went on each week new Weekly Challenges would be available to all Players, after finishing a week of challenges the Player would unlock a Secret Loading Screen, each loading screen had to do with the Storyline, when Week 7 Released and Players could finish the week, they were given a Secret Loading Screen showing The Visitor escaping from The Meteor as seen in the image above. as the Weeks wen't by Trucks were spotted by Player's carrying the Hop Rocks to the Villain Base, it was believed that The Visitor was using these Hop Rocks to power the Rocket Ship in the Villain Base on the Mountain by Snobby Shores, (I also forgot to mention that The Visitor took over the Villain Base and turned the Rocket into a working Rocket) once The Visitor was completely finished with the Rocket and transported all of the Hop Rocks into the Rocket to power up it, he got in and blasted off into the sky causing rifts to open above the Fortnite Island eventually he cracked a giant Rift in the sky allowing him to go back to where he came from.  


[The Rifts](https://i.redd.it/nz51zgcywzf21.jpg)

Season 5: Season 5 Launch Trailer revealed that the Rifts actually connected to the Real World, Our World, summoning some Real World Item's into the Game World, as time went on during Season 5 The Secret Loading Screens shown from completing specific weekly challenges showed that some characters from the game known as Brite Bomber, Drift (Forgot to mention that Drift came from the real world) Cuddle Team Leader, and Rex took a road trip across the map visiting new POI locations changed from the Start of Season 5, as time went on we got to Week 7 Challenges and when Players unlocked the Secret Loading Screen for that specific week they were able to unlock the Enforcer skin in game, the description for this skin was ""Balance and order must be restored."" by the looks of the description we can assume that they came from the Real World or some other Dimension or Planet, to the looks of it they look like Space Police and are here to fix what The Visitor caused, and that is the Rifts but by the looks of it, there plan did not go as planned because the Rifts are still here, the Rift in the sky has been shrinking since the beginning of Season 5 and has turned Purple and has been shooting purple lightning to a Specific spot on the map in the desert, as time went on the Lightning got longer and longer and eventually shooting out a Purple Cube that Players started to name it Kevin, when Players interacted with this Cube it would shoot back at them with Purple Lightning and start to glow when shot at or hit by, as more Time went on the Cube started to move around the Island printing out Runes on the ground that created a anti gravity zone around it that Players could hop around in and shoot at each other, Kevin the Cube started to place more and more of these runes down eventually placing 7 down around the Fortnite Island, Kevin then wen't tword's Loot Lake eventually falling into it and sunk down into the Lake and turned the Lake into a bouncy purple Lake with Rune symbols inside.  


https://i.redd.it/vm10ug6900g21.jpg

Season 6: The Season 6 Launch Trailer showed us that the Cube started to lift into the air under the Loot Lake middle island bringing it with it, as time went on the Cube started to move tword's the rune by Pleasant Park, it started to take it's energy from it and harness its energy into the Cube. eventually the Cube went to 6 of  the Runes and took all of there energy from it and harnessed it, the Cube started to head tword's the middle rune in the center of the Fortnite Island, it then started to suck the Energy from it, as this was happening all of the other runes started to float in the air and head tword's the Cube, the Cube then sucked all of the energy out of the rune and dropped it back into the grown, as this happened the other runes eventually circled the Cube and the Cube started to suck energy out of all the runes at the same time, after this happened it then dropped all the runes onto the ground and the Cube started to head back to the Vortex at Look lake. the Cube eventually got to Loot Lake and started to crack, as time wen't by the cube got so cracked it started to drop it's energy into the Vortex. as time wen't by even more the Cube dropped it's final amount of energy into the Vortex thus leaving the Cube dark and empty inside, the Cube then started spinning rapidly and it then exploded into pieces causing a bright beam of light to cover the Fortnite Island and teleporting all player's into some other dimension where they could float around, as players were floating a butterfly that was a rift started to appear from a beam of light, it started floating around each player eventually landing on all player's finger tip's sending them back to the Fortnite Island with a new and improved Loot Lake that had a rainbow over it and peaceful music playing in it, as time wen't on the Week 7 Secret Loading Screen was revealed showing us the A.I.M robot parachuting onto the Fortnite Island, no one knew his intentions or where he came from but we figured that out next Season. as time wen't on Player's started to spot a Iceberg coming tword's  
the Fortnite Island. as more time wen't on the Iceberg got very close and snow started to appear over the Fortnite Island thus starting Season 7. (I forgot to mention that the Cube exploded once before causing the Cube Island to break apart i didn't really think this was necassary so I didn't really mention it until i came back and decided to write this xD)  


https://i.redd.it/3uy8puhy50g21.jpg

Season 7: The Season 7 Launch Trailer revealed to us that the Iceberg hit the Fortnite Island causing a massive snow storm to cover a corner of the Island, with the new Weekly Challenges releasing it showed us that the A.I.M robots were helpers for the SGT. Winter skin that came from the Iceberg, as more time wen't on player's noticed that a new cave entrance under polar peak appeared with a new update to the game, as time wen't on more and more the Cave started to melt revealing Eggs frozen in the cave and a Prisoner was locked up in this Dungeon, as time wen't on Week 7 Challenges released allowing Player's to unlock the Week 7 Secret Loading Screen revealing that The Ice King has woken from his slumber since the ice started to melt and he melted open and the description for the loading screen is ""What Why am I Awake? This wasn't suppose to happen!"" We assuming that The Ice King froze over his palace that eventually melted causing him to wake up, but we don't know why he froze over his palace or why the Prisoner was frozen up but here is my Theory, some time in the Past the Ice King and the Fire King (The Prisoner) were living in peace with the other elements that can be found in a conference room in the Ice King's palace with symbols of them on the table, as time went on the Ice King and the other element of kings had a disagreement again'st the Fire King and they fought and the Ice King and the other Elemental King's won again'st him and they locked him up in the dungeon under polar peak. that was my theory now lets get back to the story. when the Ice King's palace melted so did the Dungeon allowing the Fire King to escape, once the Ice King woke up and realized that he was awake he then thought of the Fire King and wen't to checkup on him to make sure he was still frozen up, once he saw that he was still frozen up but still melting the Ice King decided to freeze the entire Fortnite Island to make sure the Fire King does not escape from his chains, so the Ice King created a Ice Ball in the sky so he could be in it and create some kind of Ice Shard so that he can freeze the Fortnite Island over with snow, the Ice King then broke out of his Ice Ball then creating a giant ghostly version of him self behind him on Polar Peak in the ocean, the Ice King then started to swirl his hand causing the Ghostly version of him self to do the same thing creating a Snow Storm that covered the entire Fortnite Island with snow, after this Ice Monsters started to appear around the Fortnite Island giving items when killed. as time wen't on the snow started to melt away and eventually the Island wen't back to normal, the Fire King eventually broke free from his chains because the Dungeon/Cave melted and he was free, the Week 9 and 10 Challenges released and Players completed them and unlocked the Week 9 and 10 Secret Loading Screens revealing that the Fire King had escaped and that he had unlocked his chains off of him and warmed up with a campfire at Paradise Palms. as time wen't on Player's started experiencing minor Earthquakes around the Fortnite Island that happen at random times, Player's believe that this is happening due to the Fire King and that he will do a final long and destructive Earthquake at the end of the season that was found in the files by Dataminer's. and this is where the story is at so far we will have to wait and see what Season 8 bring's. (Gosh dang this took me awhile to write LUL)

The X-4 Stormwing should, imo, have the following changes:

•Less bloom on turrets. (It is terrible on console.)

•Less Damage from the turrets.

•Have a reduction or removal of explosion damage now that you cannot crash through buildings.

•More mobility on turning. As is, it feels like the Stormwing has very slow and predictable turning. If faster turning were a thing, it would make it easier to move out of a plane shooting you from behind.

•Fixing the bugs where you can die when flipping it or the bug preventing you from steering up or down.

And I see Epic starting to do that now. The wisdom of "" If it ain't broke don't fix it"" is beginning to get lost on them, replaced with ""fix everything 8 different times in 42 different ways"". 

I love Fortnite and I keep playing it because I believe that they will recapture the magic of seasons 3 and 4. But there's been so many changes I think it's impossible now. It's not the same game it used to be.

Why did I say a nerf wouldnt be enough to fix it, it's not even possible. If it got nerfed it just wouldn't like up to its name ""Heavy"".

But honestly, this thing, in my honest opinion, gets the title for most unbalanced and overpowered gun in the game. Not even the drum gun, the rpg, etc, this thing is just terrible.

I meam, they nerfed the accuracy on it, but its still too overpowered in close distances. 40 something damage for it and a whopping 96 headshot for a gold one is just bad.

We've had 90 scar headshots before, but that was back in the day where there was sniper pumps and no one built. Times have changed and this thing is just too overpowered.

You might think the Drum Gun was op, It wasn't, it was an smg/AR hybrid and it was perfectly fine. It shot as quickly as a P90 and did almost the same damage so I honestly don't think there's any excuse to think it was op. Well it was released in the Spray and Pray era but still, it would be a more balanced gun the the Heavy AR by a landslide.

If I had the choice to vault anything, I wouldn't go for the planes, or the rpg, or the turrets, I'd vault this, and for a reason.

Every other gun in the game is completely fine to me, but the heavy takes the price for the most unbalanced gun in the game. Can't believe we've gone so long without epic realizing how overpowered it is, it's unbelievable how they've vaulted other good items like the grappler or the bolt sniper and kept this thing untouched.

I don't even pick these up because I hate it and I don't want to become one of the little fuckers who only knows how to use this thing and won't use any other gun because it's overpowered and pretty much everyone knows that. ",FortNiteBR

We all know that at some point we are going to lose the snow and have a thaw to some degree. What I propose is that throughout this transition, what was once Greasy Grove returns as Beef Bayou. Snow/ice melting from the frozen lake and Polar Peak would create a sort of swampy terrain as well as the Viking Village waterfall feeding into this area.

This is the actual definition of bayou: A marshy outlet of a lake or river. That lines up pretty well with this particular spot of the map. I could see this being a very likely idea as it brings back the swampy areas that people are so fond of from Moisty. As we have seen with POIs past (Looking at you Loot Lake) we know Epic likes to revamp to try to improve certain areas.

Another point to this theory would be this “Beef Bayou” could include a shrine or temple to coincide with the release of a “tribal/cult” version of Beef Boss to mirror what was done with TomatoHead and Tomato Temple. Just a thought, but the styles and such seem a bit one sided currently.

I’d love to do or see a mock up of some Beef Boss “cult” styles as well as what Beef Bayou may look like. Maybe I’ll put one together when I get off work.

Don’t get me wrong the reload nerf will help. But those annoying unexpected shots at you will still be bad for the game. I thought for sure a damage nerf was coming. And also the planes. I thought one of the biggest problems of the planes was that they provide free mobility with no mats spent. This is a major problem for tournaments where placement means a lot (placement should mean a lot). Also the gun on the plane is deadly to players/builds and I think should also get looked at. ,FortNiteBR

Team rumble gives you 18-20. solo is fun as is squads and duos and I can get 80-98 most of the time, but that’s still a grind. 

If you average 50 a game, your still talking about 500 games.  And at 10 minutes average per game, that’s 3 and 1/2 days of straight playing. 

Come in epic, give us something fun to do to grind out this challenge.

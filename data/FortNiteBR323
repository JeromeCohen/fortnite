The LMG is clearly very good, especially if using keyboard and mouse. The purple LMG can even completely destroy would-be one pumpers at close range, among its other uses (obliterates cover and can mow down an entire squad without needing to be reloaded). Many of you may have seen the mock up tournament with ninja vs the faze team to see who could get the most kills. Below is the link to a video of Ninja using the purple LMG without a shotgun. Obviously he is not the average player, and could wreck most of us using any weapon, but I still think this is a good example of the LMG's capabilities.

https://youtu.be/DuE5mW7bgMk

Now on to the actual discussion where I truly want to see how this community feels about the minigun. Ever since the buff to the minigun's bullet spread I've found it to be incredibly powerful in the right situations. I almost always pick up the gold minigun even when I don't have many light bullets, because most people never use their lights and you can easily end up with a ton from your squad or from looting bodies. I even grab the purple minigun unless I absolutely have to carry something else. Maybe it's because I play on console, but as a 200+ win player I am constantly destroying people's worlds with my minigun, and I NEVER have anyone else use one against me. Or when they do they have nothing else early game and they die quickly because it's not exactly ideal in every situation (getting one pumped at close range by the lucky bastard who landed on a blue pump and had his way with you). 

I really enjoy shredding would-be Bob the builders with my minigun as they struggle to ramp rush or try to get high ground while minigun rounds are constantly slipping past their destroyed barriers and even headshotting them consistently for nearly 50 dmg. When used in the right circumstances this weapon is just fantastic. 

Does anyone else actually use the minigun successfully or is it just me?

To my surprise I start up the game and only have 1,200 V\-Bucks instead of 1,850 V\-Bucks. I instantly thought my brother or someone must've gotten onto my account and bought something so I went into the Submit a Refund tab in the settings but I got a message saying ""You have no items eligible for a refund"". So at this point i'm thinking to myself, maybe someone bought Tiers so I go check and my Tier is at the same place it was left at before I got onto the game on my PC \(Tier 65\).

People are obsessed with grinding for that fully unlocked omega skin.

For a player who buys the basic battle pass and completes all daily and weekly challenges, they still need to get about 6,000 exp per day to reach level 80 by the end of the season. So many players are just now realizing they are behind after seeing the new exp requirements to reach level 80, which epic increased from season 3 without ever telling us. 

This new exp requirement is disappointing to those of us who went into season 4 with every intention of unlocking everything the battle pass had to offer. Orange lights on a set of black armor is such a small detail that doesn't make much of a cosmetic difference. It's silly of Epic to lock such a minor cosmetic behind a ridiculous amount of grinding. I understand that this is just an incentive to get players to play more and separate hardcore players from those who just bought all 100 tiers, but it's a ridiculous exp requirement.


TL;DR 

Level 80 is a ridiculous grind. Nobody who has a job and other hobbies is going to realistically reach it. Week 5 is the halfway point and we should get a double xp weekend so players can catch up.

I don’t care if you disapprove because you know it’s the only weapon you use, shotguns need to be overhauled somehow.. 

It’s not balanced in any sense that shotguns are the #1 weapon used by the entire player-base.

Is not balanced that I can get one pumped even with 100/100 on shields and health.

This game is just draining me of all motivation to play due to this obsession with shotguns.. 

Please just look at your games, look at the first weapons you pick up, look at the weapons 99% of players use when you spectate them.. it’s all shotguns, every single time.

They shouldn’t be this prevelent in the game at all.",FortNiteBR

1= the new leaked skin for the red dude is actually the evil villain working for the carbide, slowly he sends infections of these vines all around the map until it is overgrown, this will force everyone to move over to the rocket silo and go to a mars themed map(more on that soon).
2= all the filming stuff is for the moisty merman(its a film about him) and slowly moisty mores will be gone and that will become a full production studio for him, this all for the carbide and at the mansion there will soon be stuff relating to this.
3= the wailing woods bunker is a hop rock tunnel that will transfer the hop rocks to the snobby shores mountain.

I find this ridiculous because i have played with the same epic account on not only xbox but also on PC and IOS, they let me link my account to my PS4, just so that i can sign on and not use it?

-Chest searching skin, search 500 chests 

Of course all the numbers are subject to change and they were just random estimates to what I thought they would be.

There is endless possibilities and it reminds me of level 99 skill capes in Runescape which were super hard to get and I believe it should be similarly hard to get in fortnite.

* Drinking a slurp juice gives you the hop rock effect for 25 seconds if you are already at 200 HP or if you drink it while you are in the storm
* Drinking a slurp juice increases your melee damage from 10 to 50 for 25 seconds (not OP considering the ""one-pump-chump"" close quarters meta)
* The health or shield that goes nowhere after reaching 100 is instantly added to the other side after the 25 seconds is over
     * For instance, drinking a slurp at {89/25} takes you to {100/64} instead of {100/50}, and drinking a slurp at {17/100} takes you to {67/100} instead of {42/100}, where {x/y} is {health/shield}
     * The reason why the difference should be added only after the 25 seconds is over, is to keep the healing rate and total duration the same for each and every unique scenario

I like the idea of the Slurp Juice giving an overclocked effect if consumed while already at 200 HP. Something like, reload time and weapon swap delay decreased by 50% for 25 seconds, throw distance increased by 100% for 25 seconds, or consumption duration decreased by 75% for 25 seconds.
     * You could drink a slurp before popping a chug jug to decrease the consumption time from 15 to 3.75 seconds. With this effect, bandages would take 1 second, apples and mushrooms would take 0.25 seconds, minis would take 0.5 seconds, medkits would take 2.5 seconds, and half-shields would take 1.25 seconds.",FortNiteBR

For example, if an enemy is running perpendicular to me, do I slightly lead my shot to where they would be going? I have been aiming at the exact position where he is but still miss a lot. I stand still and occasionally crouch but there are times when you shouldn't be crouching.

Uncommon consumable - power potion, a potion that lasts for 1 minute long which increases the power of your pick axe. Would double pick axe damage and would allow players to swing while sprinting.

This also means the there will be future team challenges. Please advise me on how to complete this challenge. It would be really nice if some of you can play with me and help me complete the challenge. ( I play on PS4 ). ,FortNiteBR

Now I’m not talking like a super high amount of v-bucks but like 50-100 per level seems fair enough just to get me over the hump where I want to be.

It may sound like a stupid idea because you can get XP from just playing but I feel like it will help those who don’t have the time to grind hours per day to get the parts of the skins they want. You can already use v-bucks to buy tiers so why not individual levels.

Hitting a yellow 7 just to get 1 shotted from the same distance is just unacceptable. Esport with RNG loot makes it interesting but gunfights with a chance of 1 shotting isnt so interesting. Its satisfying to the person who does 200+ dmg but not so satisfying for the person who receives 200+ dmg.

""In general, lakes tend to be larger and/or deeper than ponds, but numerous examples exist of ""ponds"" that are larger and deeper than ""lakes."" For example, Echo ""Lake"" in Conway is 14 acres in surface area with a maximum depth of 11 feet, while Island ""Pond"" in Derry is nearly 500 acres and 80 feet deep. ""

Further reading suggests that the New Brunswick's Environment and Local Government would classify Loot Lake as a pond. Their website page says the below:

""A lake is a very slow flowing body of open water which occupies a land depression.  This group of water bodies includes ponds and impoundments. ""

They are viable in certain situations, but when have you ever held a slurp over 3 minis? A fat potion? For me, it's not even a question. Mini's and 50 pots are both lower in rarity than Slurp's and are chosen infinitely more often. Slurp's right now are only good if you bandaged up to 75 hp and need the little push to get back to full. In other words, *something* about the Slurp's need to change.

There are a lot of ways to make the Slurp more useful/live up to it's epic rarity, but I think the following buff's would be the most beneficial:

1. Allow us to stack **three** at a time, but still only spawn/drop one at a time.
2. Allow us to **consume more than one at a time** to stack the effects of health/shield instead of waiting the 25 seconds to pop another slurp.
3. Change the dynamic of slurp's. If you take one with 90 health &amp; no shields, you'll get to full health and 40 shields. If you take it with 80 health and 20 shields, you'll finish with 100 health &amp; 50 shields and so on . In other word's, have it operate similarly to how it currently does, **but if you're health regens fully to 100, allow the difference to overflow onto shields**.
4. Decrease drop rate by \~10&amp;#37; since we've buffed the effects.
5. ????
6. Profit

Let me know what you guys think of buffing the slurp's or even some more ideas to make them more useful. They're only one step down from a Chug and nowhere near as viable as a fat potion or even a stack of minis.",FortNiteBR

I'm hoping to start a dialogue that sheds light on the strategies that have worked best for you when going for high kill games.

As a background, I've been doing a fair amount of tournaments online where the goal is not to achieve a victory royale but instead to make sure you get more kills then the person you're competing against. 

I think its pretty obvious that landing somewhere like Tilted, or Retail Row (where many other players land) is a good place to land for high kills, but how does one decide where to go after clearing out a big town? 

Alternatively, perhaps many of you land outside of Tilted/Retail and then decide to move in quickly to pick up the kills (I didn't want to discredit this approach). 

For those of you having a lot of success, are any/all of your decisions data driven or more of a instinct? 

Perhaps this dialogue can be furthered by a real world example. For instance, say the bus goes over dead center of the map (North to South). If people want to expand on this example with some of their knowledge/opinions please feel free!

I dont know how exacly it works but Fortnite probablly checking ingame stats, win%, how many games you played, etc... as these numbers are better, the players that are against you are better, as a username with 37% winrate and 8KD I went to check out how games are being played, I have 8-9 kills per match, 7 out of the players are going for a build fight, with build fight I mean 600-700 metals are gone in this fight inclouding both of us having double pump, Top 10 all the server in 1X1 bases and seeing build fights all over the place in the map (60 solos games based), added to that in the lobby all of the players having skins(I know skins != skill), and the noskins having backpacks from season 2-3), just droping it. username2 (50 games, 0% ratio): In this account all of the players are actually avg-, dont know how to build, completley new players, you can check it out btw, all the lobby are full of noskins without backpacks and the players with the skins are really 10-20%. I know it's a long post and people wont belive me, but Epic added a MMR system (Which is GOOD in my opinion), just wanna let you guys know and tbh Epic should of told us that and not ghostly add it. And nope, it's not luck, its a consistently thing and I can drop you some replays from the higher stats account and compare it with the new player account. Have a nice day.",FortNiteBR

20v20 is ok, but it just doesn't have the same feeling of choas and war that 50v50 V2 does.

2 buses, 2 sides, 1 big nearly endless fight that feels like a war.

It was so awesome, and 20v doesn't capture that feel. 


20v20v20v20v20 feels more like, what you'd do for a qualifiers for a Ranked tournament pre LAN. Where you seed teams and then run matches to get the qualifiers.

50v50V2 feels far more blessed in the chaos of war, and yet it was relaxing and fun and carefree too.

For the record I feel this update is a good thing - it will improve the game long-term and frustratingly it's just going to take time to learn how to aim again for some of us. 

What would help massively though is a finer incremented sensitivity slider on consoles similar to the ADS slider. I've seen this recommended a lot and it's strange to see how it's never really gained much traction (could definitely be wrong on that).

Rather than giving us the base 10 options, give us the ability to change the X/Y sensitivities in increments of 0.1, maybe even 0.01 e.g. X: 8.2/ Y: 8.2 or X: 8.23/ Y: 8.23.

I feel this change would definitely help people who are currently having these new sensitivity issues due to the update, as well as generally allow people to fine tune their sensitivity to find that perfect balance.

I accidentally bought the highlander when it came out and I regret it so much, a single refund that can work for your entire fortnite career will (in my opinion) make the community more happen because I personally know that many people regret buying something, but the refund system wasn’t out, and when it did come out it was too late and you couldn’t refund.

With the release of builder pro, console players can compete when building with PC players in cross play. There’s one problem though, editing on console is way slower than PC. On PC you are able to tap a button to edit, on console you have to hold B for a couple milliseconds before it actually allows you to edit, and that’s if the game doesn’t bug out and cancel your edit. I have seen no one post this idea yet and I don’t know why, it’s such an easy fix. Press Y to instant edit your building on console Fortnite with builder pro. What does Y do in builder mode? It swaps to your harvesting tool. If we want to swap to our harvesting tool we can exit builder mode and press Y. Yeah it’s a little slower then pressing Y while in builder mode, but why would it matter if we’re just harvesting materials? I think we should prioritize a quick edit that can save our life than getting materials a couple milliseconds faster. ",FortNiteBR

Weekly Challenges:

As you obviously know, every week you get 50 battle stars. Let’s add 10 because of the free secret battle pass tier and you get 60 stars.
10 weeks with each having 60 stars equals 600 stars or 60 battle pass tier levels.


Leveling bonus:

For level 1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9 you get 2 stars.
For level 5 you get 5 stars and for level 10 you get 10 stars. This equals 31 stars for 10 levels.
Therefore leveling up to 100 just gives you 31 level.
This is also highly impossibru.
Let’s calculate this with level 80
8 times 31 equals 248, so around 25 battle pass tiers.


Daily challenges:

For every daily challenge you get 5 stars. With all  weekly challenges done and reaching level 80 you are sitting at battle pass tier 85. you are missing 150 stars. This equals 30 daily challenges. 
You can get up to 350 stars or 35 battle pass tiers from daily challanges.

TL;DR

Do all weekly challenges.

Reach lv 80 - 30 daily challanges needed

Reach lv 70 - 36 daily challanges needed

Reach lv 60 - 42 daily challanges needed

Reach lv 15 - 70 daily challanges needed (all)

Last night's update brought a subtle addition that seem to be omnipresent and unnoticed thus far: The Vines.

Scan the ground for a few seconds no matter where you are and you're sure to come across a stealthy little vine sprout. While they seem harmless and you cant interract with them yet, I fear that like the new vegetation around Dusty Divot, They're Growing.

Thanks to datamining *SPOILERS* we have seen our first glimpse of the [Vegetation Based Villain](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8n6xq6/new_datamined_skins/) who I believe is responsible for the infestation. 

I speculate that our viney villain is responsible for the meteors, having sent them to earth as a means of planting the seeds for his infestation and freeing Omega. In the coming weeks we will see the vines begin erupting out of the ground (possibly a kind of reverse-meteor mechanic where vines lift players into the sky and destroy bases) and causing chaos which can only be quelled by a powerful new hero. (blockbuster skin?)

A few questions I'm left with:

Is it possible the bunker in wailing woods is somehow involved? 

What is Omega's invlovement in all of this?

Have I completly lost my damned mind?

As the title says, I think there should be some sort of ""reputation"", similar to how some other games have a good sport/bad sport tracker for each player(can't think if any off the top of my head, sorry it's late, but I believe halo had something similar in one of their games). 

BM'ers are the BANE of  my existence. I understand if you need ammo or resources, or if teammates aren't around, or if it's an intense fight and you don't want them giving callouts. Those I understand. I'm talking about the ones who, even if they're getting fired at by your whole team, those ones that, just to ruin your whole teams fun, gets a knock, and then THIRSTS the ever living @$%! Out of you. You know the ones I mean(and if your one of those, just stop playing this game). You could absolutely demolish a team, then you get that one dude who is hiding and gets the lucky drop on your teammate while you scramble to look for them, then by the time anyone can react, your teammate is BM'ed. It absolutely ruins my day when people do that.

My proposal, is just a meaningless ""good sport/bad sport"" rating system. Similar to how the report system works, after you die you click a button, and can rate them a good sport, or a bad sport. Everyone will start out with a full rating, and as you get bad ones your rating goes down, or if you get good ones it goes back up. When you die whoever your spectating, or if your doing squad fill, right next to their name could be a little percentage, the lower the number, the poorer of a sport they are. It could just be meaningless, In my opinion if I had a super low number next to my name I'd feel crappy about myself, I think it would just be a good way to deter most people from BMing.

I know this could lead to people just getting mad and labelling someone a bad sport just cause they killed them, but if your a good player and genuinely outplay someone, hopefully enough people will be a good Samaritan and give them a good rating.

Maybe down the road after they get more than enough ratings for people they could implement that as a sort of match making, so only bad sports get stuck with bad sports.

This is only an idea, welcome to any suggestions, thanks for reading! 

TL;DR BM'ers are the worst part about the game (and I only mean the ones that thirst you to ruin your good time), epic should implement a Good sport/Bad sport system",FortNiteBR

I remember when people started to realize that building was a great strategy, but now the entire game is who can build faster and better then the person you're fighting.

Issue 1-Editing
This can be addressed by allowing players to make preliminary edits by pressing L3 and Circle and this will allow you to access all your builds and edit them.

Issue 2-What materials are you using.
This is already fine and can still be allocated to the left d-pad. However, a yellow box should appear around the seleceted material. 

Please upvote this so the devs can see it because i really feel that console players are being held back when it comes to building due to the 2 tap to build on builder pro. Builder pro was an extremely good addition but this update would make it god tier.

For those who don’t know with the recent update they fixed an “issue” with stick input when moving diagonally because it didn’t meet speed of the camera rotation if I understand it correctly.

I understand where you’re coming from epic and trying to make your game the best it could possibly be and optimizing certain things but as for this I genuinely feel it didn’t need to be done. All the muscle memory engrained in us behind most shots and general movement just feels completely off to the feel of the game. It has made aiming much more difficult for the period of time I’ve played today and made sniping ridiculously sensitive to the point it’s difficult to line up shots on stationary targets with the swiftness I would normally be able to.

I’m not one to complain about most things epic does and I’ve given them the benefit of the doubt with most things they’ve done whether it be mechanic changes with weapon swapping to drastic new item additions like the jet pack. As for this update however it just feels so different to the point I didn’t enjoy playing at all knowing I lost fights in situations that I would otherwise be winning if it weren’t for this change. 

I propose it ether be reverted to the way it was which most players have acclimated to or at least add a dead zone slider of some sort so we can fine tune this to our liking.

Other than that I enjoyed the update and all the movement epic is making to the future for console like optimizing turbo building and editing sensitivity so hopefully they keep it going on a consistent pace",FortNiteBR

1. You must give up a slot for the second pump.-this could hinder your gameplay in other ways and thus is a trade off you make for the extra potential of two pumps.

2. You still must hit your shots for double pump to be effective, it's easily countered by building and far more reliant on skill than other weapons such as RPGs to get effective damage output from.

3. The switch timing makes double pump much more of an art that takes practice than it was in its former glory. Granted anyone can learn the timing but not just anybody can pick it up and utilize proper timing, aim, positioning, and upkeep the tempo all at the same time without some practice. 

4. The argument about being able to output 400+ damage in such little time is irrelevant and I'll explain how I've come to that opinion. A Green pump has a max headshot of 225, a gray tac(which mind you fires 2.5 times faster than a pump) has a max headshot of 175. Therefore under the same conditions you should be able to put out more damage with pump-tac by switching and firing one sometimes even two tac shots after the initial pump faster than double pump. Double pump simply sustains the effective output beyond the burst damage of pump tac more efficiently. 

5. When they originally tried to take it away people just found the next fastest or most efficient alternatives. Pump-tac and other variants are very similiar, we obviously are going to continue this trend in any way possible.

This is where my feelings on the subject lie currently in short, I'm sure I could list more but I don't feel that it's needed at this point in time. I'm happy to hear anyone who disagrees opinion out, especially if you have good reasoning as to why you do. I will even consider seeing the other side if you can show me why it's too powerful compared to other meta load outs currently. I don't mean to start a riot, but Instead would like a civil discussion as to why you agree or disagree rather than continue to see post after post everywhere calling for another nerf. ",FortNiteBR

I know that players on pc are harder (sometimes) to go up against, but I still just dont get what I'm doing wrong. That one win that I did get was obtained in my first couple days when I literally just snuck up behind the last guy and shot him in the face. Overall I feel that as long as somebody doesn't shotgun me from nowhere, that I have pretty decent aim. I can build alright, and usually getting 1-3 kills isn't too hard. However when it gets to the last 20 or so people I always end up getting rpg'd, snuck up on, or just simply outplayed. I have about 2 duo wins, and I feel the gamemode is easier.

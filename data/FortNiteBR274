Exhibit A: Pretend you're in a build battle and you do the Tfue Classic where you Shotgun, jump and build a floor to keep the high ground. You can't do that anymore because for some reason, when you build a wall, it still gives you a delay on the shotty when you switch back.

Base Damage should come back to 90/95 to make the pump an actual weapon of use, they nerfed damages in Mid season 4 to counter double pumps/shotgun but now, it's gone so there's no reason to still have it to 80/85 now

The equip time should be changed also. Again this is another thing Epic tried to do to counter double pumps/shotguns but now, it's gone, so no reason to have it anymore. ",FortNiteBR

25,Lithium43,1531437380,8yer69,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yer69/the_double_shotgun_nerf_unnecessarily_removes_a/,0,The double shotgun nerf unnecessarily removes a lot of balanced close range options and forces everyone into a shotgun + SMG meta,"Before the 5.0 patch, there were a lot of close range options that the player had when it came to weapon choice. Now, the undeniable best choice is shotgun + SMG since every double shotgun option has been removed. The problem is, shotgun + SMG was already just as strong as all the other options were (aside from double heavy). The TTK for pump + tac SMG is generally lower than the TTK for double pump because the SMG has no equip delay and has insanely high DPS. After the SMG buff, the pro scene saw huge shotty + tac SMG usage and still does. A few of the many examples off the top of my head would be:

* [Teeqzy breaking the solo duo record using Pump + SMG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXIBlTBzeNs). 
* [This set of Poach and Kenith 1v1ing and both are using pump + SMG in every match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4yS976ar4c).
* Ninja using shotty + SMG in pretty much all of his recent videos.
* [Cloak using shotgun + SMG in this tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-ilimebkXg). 

I know everyone is determined not to believe it, but double shotgun stopped being overpowered after shotguns got nerfed and SMGs got buffed. People were using double shotgun because they found it the most enjoyable or because it fit their playstyle better, but it absolutely was not outright better than pump + SMG. I literally used it because I found double shotgun more fun/satisfying than spraying and praying with an SMG, that's the only reason.

We were no longer at a point where double shotgun was undeniably the best close range option. It feels like the people who complained until Epic felt pressed into removing it were all just stuck in the pre-shotgun nerf past when it was actually overpowered and are upset that they're still getting killed by it. Before, some people couldn't decide whether to double shotty or shotty + SMG because both were viable. Now, that decision has been made for us.",FortNiteBR

# Map

The map created by Epic and updated today is trash, for some reasons : 

* New places like the Viking area and the desert one are not consistent with the overall style of the map and therefore are very artificial like **Lucky Landing**

[Viking Area](https://i.redd.it/q1m9wwe9el911.jpg)

* Removing **Anarchy Acres** is a shame, Anarchy was probably one of the funniest places of the game especially in 50v50 with a lot of loot and close fights. Lazy Links is almost made by grass with few chests.
* The desert area is very difficult to watch : very bright colors even more than the original map. However Paradise Palms and the other cities are very well made with a modern/mexican architecture style. 
* Covering **Dusty Divot** by trees is stupid, Dusty Divot had not to be modified. Today it's an another useless part of the part.

So globally, instead of removing **Flush Factory**, **Haunting** or **Junk Junction** they modify the best areas.

I think also they have to do a second map because transition between desert and grass land is somewhat brutal.

# Season Pass and Gameplay

For the season pass and the gameplay :

* Some good skins but some are hurting my eyes like **the Redline** or **the Rook**.

[The Redline](https://i.redd.it/uyvg9ioldl911.jpg)

[The Rook](https://i.redd.it/ltno1220el911.jpg)

* Epic Games has removed double pumping after reintroducing it, I don't know why, I don't understant their thinking behind it. We can't even double pump with tactical pump and the hunting one. 
* The dances and the outfits are not outstanding as the precedents seasons.

I think what is very important to underlines is that the modifications of the map and the season pass have almost nothing in common (except the viking area). A desert area without any really ""desert"" or an explorer is a real question.

I'm nostalgic of the previous map because it was more coherent and well made. Today it looks like a bunch of islands tied together.",FortNiteBR

Coming from a player that has almost very limited time to play Fortnite,

I've grinded so much, won around 20 games, and played almost 220 games last season, with and without friends and still managed to come short for the Omega final unlock, level 70 to be exact.

I've used the XP weekend to the max, and tried to maximize my XP gains with friends.

And still didn't made it, which leaves me super sad, as I love Omega and would have loved to have it completely.

With this new Season I'm really content with the new system, which is the same but carries over the progress once the season has ended.

On a hopeful attempt, Epic, will you please revert the Omega Challenges, and allow us to continue our quest for the coolest skin in the game? I understand it may not even be fair for those who grinded, until the end, but time is quite limited on my and I know many others side, this would make the community really happy I feel like.

I wouldn't even mind to have to get the 80 levels worth of XP again, knowing I could play peacefully and that eventually I would complete my favorite skin. I really do love this game, and the skin really, love the colors available. Was really hoping to use the purple Omega with the Raven Back Bling :P

I'm a founder, a S3, S4 and now S5 battle pass owner, and this would mean the world to me and many of us I hope, even tho I do understand that the likelihood of something like this happening is really limited.

Either way, thanks Epic, thanks Fortnite Community,

Love you guys.",FortNiteBR

Before all of the ‚Äòcasual‚Äô players say that the double shotty was overpowered, let me just be blunt: it wasnt.

Before I go on my rant, I‚Äôd like to define the term ‚Äúskill ceiling‚Äù to begin. Skill ceiling refers to how much a player can improve over time. For reference, a game where a first time player is very similar to a player with many hours has a low skill ceiling, whereas a game like CSGO(sorry for mentioning it) has people with thousands of hours and are still finding ways to get better.



I fully believe a game with a greater skill ceiling is a better game. It rewards those who put the time and effort into mastering the game and gives newer players incentive to get better. Period.


Using double shotguns took skill. It required people to train themselves to learn how to hotkey from slot to slot switching from shotty to shotty, whether it be the pump to another pump, pump tac, etc etc. It was a mechanic required to learn, and by removing this mechanic its another step that GREATLY lowers the skill ceiling in this game. 


Secondly, the shotty-smg meta or using one shotty and opting for a sniper/splodes was just as strong as opting for a double shotgun setup after the nerf. You could easily shred people just as quick with a tac smg the time it takes to get 3-4 pump bullets out. Removing the double shotgun mechanic just removes another option and creates a meta for Fortnite- a go to setup. Frankly, it seems like Epic doesnt like having a meta with the previous shotgun nerf and smg buffs. Removing double shotguns is just creating a different meta that will have people inevitably complaining that they are getting shredded by drum guns and tac smgs.


I truly don‚Äôt understand why Epic introduced this mechanic into Fortnite. As a player with 2000+ games played and 450+ wins, I think Fortnite was the most balanced prior to this patch (minus some personal explosive opinions and the double heavy, which imo deserved a rate of fire decrease)

Lastly, to the people complaining about ‚Äúspam building‚Äù and getting shredded by shotguns, you shouldn‚Äôt be salty about dying and calling for a nerf. Instead, you should
be learning ways to outplay your opponent and improve, but with this nerf it removes this option


TLDR: Double shotguns were NOT overpowered, it removes an option for players to use, lowers the skill ceiling, and inevitably creates a meta that will lead to unhappy people. Please Epic, bring back the double shotties.",FortNiteBR

Epic continues to add POI to the same map we have had from the start... From somebody who has been playing Fortnite since S2, playing the same map over and over has gotten boring and repetitive. I was tired of the map when S4 started and at this point I don't even want to play simply because of the map. Yeah the new POI are cool, but maybe for a couple hours tops. In the end, we're all running around the same map in every single game. 

The skins in the battle pass just don't reel me in. The only skin I saw worth grinding for to wear, was the 99 skin ( don't know the name). The other skins seem so generic to me or... of lesser value than previous seasons if that makes sense. Like the female racer? She should not have been included in the BP considering her male counterpart wasn't, and from the amount of time I have seen the Burnout skin in game, it didn't do well in purchases. Either way, I can't seem to convince myself to wear any of those skins if I were to unlock them. 

I know people are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum on this topic but Epics' new content, or lack of.. has really started to push me away from the game. Which is a shame for me because when I started back in S2, I was hooked. Bought my first Battle Pass when S3 started and was having loads of fun. Now, every game feels the same to no matter what the outcome is, whether I got a victory or was the 6th to be eliminated. It's just not fun for me anymore and it makes me sad because I love this game and its' potential to be the greatest online game to ever be played. I just feel like at this point, Epic Games aren't making the right steps forward to continue to expand the game. Like, when are we getting STW for free!? I love BR but I also wan't to try the survival mode, it looks entertaining. They say it will be free in the future but I have yet to see any hope that it will be free anytime soon.

I am not trying to bash the game, like I said, I love the game and the potential it holds. I just don't have the 'want' to play anymore. I feel like if I buy the Battle Pass, I will be forcing myself to play the game and earn my ten dollars worth. I want to hear your opinions and possibly find a reason to keep playing while at the same time, still having as much fun as I did back in S2. Thanks for your time folks.",FortNiteBR

Season 1 has very basic and boring skins, and not much variety with other items (loading screens, graffiti, toys, etc.).

Season 2 has decent looking skins, but there were still some issues. The Black Knight looked cool but the other skins were meh.

Season 4 has pretty bad skins. Other than maxed-out Carbide and Omega, the skins were pretty bad. Graffiti was a cool idea and the loading screens were better but there really wasn‚Äôt that much going for it.

Season 5 has two really good upgradable skins, but mind you that those skins will take *ages* to max out. It‚Äôll probably be Season 7 before we see a maxes-out Tier 100 Skin. The other skins are alright. Nothing too crazy.

That‚Äôs leaves Season 3. Season 3 has the most fun and cool skins, hands-down. Mission Specialist was a cool skin to have right off the bat, compared to Carbide and the other upgradable skin from Season 5, which don‚Äôt look cool until you upgrade it.

I can understand that players who are new to the game or they're more of a casual gamer can't outplay a more dedicated gamer that can perfectly time shotgun swapping and building to become advantageous and take accurate shots.

But please don't lie about it.

What I mean is the overwhelming outcry against double shotguns is ""omg it's an exploit/glitch"".

I can see this argument being true with double pumping because a pump shotgun should require the player to actually pump before a second shot.

The argument becomes dumb when you talk about tactical and heavy shotguns. Those weapons do NOT require a pump. The tac and heavy shotguns were created by epic games to fire without a pump, essentially making them like any other semi auto weapon in Fortnite.

Those are the facts, plain and simple.

Therefore, why implement this ridiculous delay when swapping from one shotgun to a tac or heavy shotgun? The answer: people get outplayed and complain to daddy (epic games).

What other reason would Epic Games implement a handicap to the tac and heavy shotgun that SHOULD be consistent with every other gun, but isn't?",FortNiteBR

This is a pretty bad glitch and Epic needs to work on this ASAP for the safety and privacy of the community!!!

1) I want every outfit and emote and spray now. Plain and simple. If I have the money I want it all now.

2) I enjoy spending the large chunk of money because I know Epic games is putting every penny to good use.

3) THE XP BOOST. Not a lot of people know but when you are at tier 100 you get XP for all the challenges and leveling up. And the instant %120 XP boost. 

The last reason is the point all the people making the ‚ÄòTakes the fun out of challenges‚Äô argument. I grind challenges just like the rest of you because you bet I want to hit that 500,000 XP!!

Anyways my question to you guys is what is your reason for buying/not buying tiers?

270,ExcerptMusic,1531419808,8ycbgw,37,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ycbgw/im_done_with_fortnite_maybe_some_of_you_agree_why/,0,I'm done with Fortnite. Maybe some of you agree why.,"I've loved playing this game since launch and feel like the devs do an awesome job at keeping things fresh, however some issues to the core gameplay that put me in a bad mood every time I play and usually start my games with ""Ugh here we go"". I've just been a more negative person from playing, and I wish it wasn't like that. I know the title is dramatic but I seriously want to get a discussion going on the state of the game for people with my perspective.  So here are a few reasons that I know some of you agree with me on but might not ever bring it up for fear of downvotes.

1. Ramp rush shotguns. What if I told you I know how 90% of my games end? I see someone within assault weapon range. Start shooting. They keep building towards me while I'm only hitting ramps. By the time they get to me i'm reloading or switching weapons. They're above me shooting down with a shotgun and the game turns into a cat and mouse around a 1x1 box while jumping around. What are the options? Build battle? Reminds me of the people that only practice 360 no scopes in COD. Except in this game it's required to beat your opponent. No options to avoid build battles. 

2. Shotguns. Good lord, if they gave me 10xp for every time someone killed me with a shotgun from assault weapon range, i'd have full Omega halfway through Season 4. Can we increase the drop off range of these please? I appreciate the SMG boost, but again see #1. Maybe this will never change because it's Epic and they love their shotguns, but to be honest, the best game modes are ones without shotguns.

3. Incentives. The game has gone from just kill people and try to win, to how much xp can you get in a season. The xp, by the way, needs a huge boost in the kill xp area. If you can camp in a tree all game to get top 10 with no kills and get more xp than someone dropping tilted and getting 15 kills, something is wrong. Why is the ultimate goal Victory Royale? For 99 people with the goal of #1, their game ends in disappointment. How about side medals and xp for most kills, longest distance ran, tallest building, highest fall, etc. Give people other goals to aim for, and maybe they might happen to get a win along the way. 

4. Wins. After my 20th win I stopped taking screenshots. It was boring. You don't get anything except more xp and another number in your win counter. The game has stopped being about getting wins and just to create fun between dropping and dying/winning. Why no V-Bucks for wins?

5. Getting into the action. The worst part in any game is the time it takes to go from start up to action. Sometimes you just want to load up and start shooting, over and over. Call of Duty was great with this, of course respawning helped and this is an entirely different beast. However, simple changes could be made to get people into the part they like best. Game lobby, add respawning with damage/kills here. You're right in the action then. Finally, after you win/die, have the option to load right back into a game lobby. No more loading screen to home page to play to wait to lobby to game.. Just a queue up from the game results/spectate screen. *Side note, maybe a shorter bus flight path or faster bus and an ability to pull the chute whenever you want. If you hit the ground you hit the ground.. 

I know for a fact some of you agree with everything i've said because i've had conversations about each of these with people on the sub. My overall goal is to be less negative about the game and find new ways to enjoy it in the future if I come back to it after a season away. Tell me what you think, what you agree with and what you don't, or better suggestions.

However, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with this season already. This battle pass is by far the most underwhelming of all the seasons so far. Yeah unlockable styles are cool and all, but there's no real incentive to go for them. I have unlimited time and literally everyone can get it (participation award) a simple fix to the xp system based off what the community has suggested would've easily solved the Level 80 problem from happening again. 

AGAIN, battle pass tiers are wasted on throwable emotes and garbage skins. Everyone knows what sledgehammer looks like. A female burnout? Why couldn't that just be in the store? I don't get Rook. Why does Epic never stay true to the actual theme of the season in the battle pass and then proceed to release even better skins in the store later that do? And oh i nearly forgot, there's only 2 terrible pickaxes in this pass minus the drift one.

The map. Cool changes indeed, but PLEASE just fill in dusty FULLY already. I miss the high traffic battles in the fields near dusty from season 1 to 3 but season 4 dusty was nothing but a fucking suicide pit. The desert is cool i guess but still it's a corner piece of the map.

I‚Äôm sure most people are in the same boat as me as far as playing far less fortnite lately than I used to. I was really hoping Season 5 would make me excited again. It didn‚Äôt. 

-Still no rewards for winning. This is the biggest thing that makes me lose interest in this game. What game doesn‚Äôt have rewards for playing the game at a high level? Literally every game ever created gives rewards for winning. Fortnite still doesn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúOH YAY ANOTHER WIN ADDED TO MY STATS THAT ONLY I CAN SEE!‚Äù Who gives a shit?

-If Week 1 Challenges are any indication, the challenges are still terrible despite the community asking for something different. Nobody wants to do ‚ÄúKill 3 People Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúOpen 7 Chests Here‚Äù challenges. They aren‚Äôt fun.

-The buildup for Season 5 was all garbage. Nothing that happened in the story was ever explained or utilized. We kept theorizing all sorts of stuff that simply never mattered. Season 4 at least had a story that made sense as far as the meteor. Season 5 just added new POI‚Äôs and gameplay mechanics that had little to do with the story before it, or if it did, was never explained. 

-Battlepass rewards are the same filler crap as previous seasons despite the community begging for something different. Nobody cares about throwable garbage and sprays and banner icons. Yes, I know not every tier can be something amazing and there needs to be filler. But there were plenty of suggestions about what to add given by the community that Epic could have taken inspiration off of. 

-Still no fix to XP gains in solos or for kills. Once again, the only way to level up at a reasonable pace is to play in squads with people who have the battlepass. It‚Äôs a money grab by Epic, plain and simple. I had to buy my friends battlepasses last season because I needed them to have the XP boost in order to level up since I couldn‚Äôt do it in solos. As far as XP for kills, Epic yet again ignores ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù as a good thing. Getting kills should give a lot of XP, more than hiding in a bush all game in order to reach Top 10. It‚Äôs a punishment to the people who are good at this game. 

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of other things people could complain about, but when I woke up today to see these things, me and my friends all said how annoyed we were and how we were unlikely to play much anymore, let alone buy the battlepass again. 

Others may disagree with me, and that‚Äôs OK, but every single person I‚Äôve spoken to who plays fortnite a lot is very burnt out and Season 5 did nothing to fix that.

I understand it's all cosmetic so it doesn't really matter at the end of the day, but hear me out. 

I paid 10 dollars for the battle pass. I paid another 10 for the 5 dollar vbuck deals they had going 3 weeks back. However, I bought the pass a good deal into the season. I made it to BP level 70 something before realizing I wasn't gonna make the cut-off of the season. I really wanted to get all the skins and what not that I paid for, so I used my vbucks and bought the tiers I was missing. I got Omega, but the challenges don't carry over to season 5? am I missing something here? Am I just doomed now to never have the complete Omega set just because I didn't earn the parts while the season was on? if that's the case, I'm gonna have to say that's a little scammy. I understand that once the season is over you can't earn the stuff on the previous season's Battle Pass, but I think it really really sucks to have skin specific challenges be Battle Pass exclusive. I worked hard to get the skin, then spent my vbucks to make it to the end of the battle pass, instead of using them for the next one, and I still don't get everything I paid for. Just seems a little off. I just want to know why this is even a thing. ",FortNiteBR

For example, the double pump was only usable if the player had put time into the game learning the timing, but after this update double pump is completely unusable because of the delay between shotgun swaps. 
Another thing that was changed was the materials. I believe that the only thing that separated the good players from the bad was the building and editing. I know this was changed to help the new players get into the game without getting bummed every fight, but taking away something your players which have been playing since launch day is an amazing way so get your players to hate you and make them turn away from your game. H1Z1 is a perfect example of what you shouldn't do to your game, changing something players had spent 2 years perfecting making them just as clueless as the player that bought the game yesterday.
Saying Fortnite might be worse then PUBG is not an exaggeration in my opinion and that is saying a lot, as Bluehole are potentially the most careless developers I've ever seen. I invite you to change my mind but I think Ive made up my mind about this game.

In a game where building leads to close quarters fights shotguns are going to be necessary. In a game where you have a very small window to hit someone during build battles, you need high burst damage. Yet Epic continues to nerf them, over, and over, and over. Congratulations, you made the Heavy almost useless, the pump IS useless, and the tactical is the only viable option.

Removing double pump, and double heavy? Really? It is such a fun mechanic and it takes skill to use. Nerfing one pumps was understandable, you could use two and yes, it was pretty overpowered. But it was okay because you could still double pump. However now it is almost useless. There is no reason to EVER take a blue pump over a blue tac right now. I can‚Äôt think of any situation where I would take one over the other.

Double shotguns is NOT overpowered and that is proven by the fact that most people still used a tac, and you almost always come across two pump shotguns per a match. It is fair in almost every situation.

Nerfs to building, nerfs to high skill and BALANCED mechanics.

You‚Äôre lowering the skill gap, and it‚Äôs not healthy for the game. It‚Äôs healthy for no one. It kills everyone‚Äôs drive to become better at the game. 

Something needs to change.",FortNiteBR

Why not make all the skins in the pass theme related to the time-travel elements? Vikings, Cowboys, and other time period related things, not random skins like Season 4's lollipop girl. And watch them release theme appropriate skins in the item shop that would have been much better suited for the pass. Just watch.

However, I see a lot of posts of people bitching about the subject without giving any real reasons as to why the removal is a good or bad idea.

For personal context: back a few weeks ago, I kept getting melted in solos by double pumps.  Instead of complaining, I just learned how to do it.  It took me about a week of playing a lot, forcing shotgun fights, and dying a lot to actually get the hang of it using my 2/3 keys.  I see a lot of people saying it‚Äôs skill-less; I can see from my own experience that that‚Äôs certainly not true.  It‚Äôs clearly not something you can just pick up and master in a day unless you change your keybinds in a way that allows for faster muscle memory.  It seemed like something that created separation in the skill gap of the game.

So, as a serious question, why is it that people think it was the right move to change this?  I have more respect for the argument that it was overpowered, but it certainly wasn‚Äôt unstoppable.  I‚Äôd run into people who were better than me all the time and they‚Äôd just outbuild me and pick smart shots to counter it.

I was just a little surprised to see how much support this got on this sub and I wanna hear peoples‚Äô opinions :)

After that got nerfed, the only real reason to keep it was to stop double pump from being stronger. Now, the pump doesn't have the damage to justify its slow pullout speed anymore and double pump is no longer possible, but the pump delay is still here. Nobody liked this change when it was introduced and although now people are used to it, it makes even less sense now than it did before. Remove the pump delay so that the weapon can feel fluid again and players with the skill to do fast edit shots with the pump will be rewarded.",FortNiteBR

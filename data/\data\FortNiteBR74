In season 7, the startup screen (the one with all the Battlepass skins on a plane) shows the Ice King was wielding a sword. This sword was later added to the game and given the title, the INFINITY BLADE. The weapons was of a completely new tier that was dubbed ""Mythic""

In Season 8, the startup screen shows Ember drawing a bow. This bow could very well be added into the game as a Mythic tiered weapon. I've even thought of a name. It can be called the INFINITY BOW. Yk, completing the INFINITY DUO.

38,Tritan16,1552078084,ayv4j0,22,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ayv4j0/a_solution_to_turtling/,0,A Solution to Turtling,"Turtling has been a ""strategy"" in BR for quite a while now. It hasn't been fun to play against for most players, especially since the nerfs to RPG and Hand Cannon. I think that Epic should try to implement a nerf of change of sorts to combat turtling, and I have an idea of what that change could be.

I think a good solution to the turtling problem would be this:

If you build an object, say a wall for example, and it gets destroyed (by an enemy specifically), you cannot place the same type of building in the exact location the precious one was for a second or two. In this example, a wall wouldn't be able to be placed where a previously destroyed friendly wall was for about a second, giving the opponent a chance to fight you instead of waiting for you to run out of mats.

This will allow build fight to operate normally but turtling will be significantly less effective and encourage players to actually play the game and engage in fights rather than playing passively.

Let me know what you think of this idea or other ideas on how to fix turtling. Or maybe you don't think turtling is an issue. This is just what I think would be a good fix since I personally don't find turtling to be a healthy ""strategy"" to have in the game in its current state.",FortNiteBR

52,FierceAnnihilator,1552076113,ayurkc,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ayurkc/opinions_on_the_double_barrel_shotgun/,1,Opinions On The Double Barrel Shotgun,"So I've been thinking about something for a while, and after testing it out a lot, I can't really see why the double barrel shotgun was vaulted. I was pretty fine with it when we had the Heavy Shotgun, but now that it's gone, the variety for shotguns is gone.

If you have no shotgun and you find a tac, you take it. If you find a blue+ pump shotgun, maybe even a green pump, you'll swap it out. Let's say you have a blue pump. That deals 100 damage. 200 for a headshot. That's it. You have 5 attempts to deal 200 damage, with a small time between shots. You likely won't need to reload unless you're shooting someone mildly far away. A blue tac wouldn't do well compared to a pump, considering you need at least 2 shots to finish someone. So there is almost no reason to run a tac, which leaves the pump as the only good shotgun for intense fights.

Now imagine the double barrel. 2 shots, almost no time in between shots, and has slightly better range. The bodyshot damage is a little high, so I would lower that just slightly, but keep the headshot damage the same. However, in a normal situation with a pump VS double barrel, the double barrel player would either not deal enough damage or be pumped in the face before they can finish off the other player. I've tried the double barrel out in playground/the other gamemode  plenty of times, and when I started using the pump, I think it did a little better. If you use the double barrel on someone who has full health/shield and a pump in an intense situation, you likely won't finish them, and if you could, it would probably be very close. So what I would suggest is to reduce the bodyshot damage but keep the headshot damage the same, and instead of it being purple/gold, make it blue/purple instead to balance it out. I'm probably missing some other factor that could make the double barrel better than the pump, but these are just my thoughts. Let me know what you think!",FortNiteBR

People saw in the skies what looks to be a meteor

The community went wild and everyone had their theories.

Here's mine.

When the meteor hit, V had to know what's going on.

So they set up a movie set and said that the divots were part of the set to cover their research thus creating the rivalry between Omega and Carbide to distract people from truth, they started to move the rocks slowly to their base.


Then the countdown began.

The Visitor went to launch the rocket.

This Rocket Launch is the cause of what to happen next,Rifts. Here we see the first power change

Space Rocks ( consumables &amp; structures )

&gt;&gt;

Rifts [ errors in the system of time and space ]

Things began to come from other dimensions like a viking ship, a golf course and club ( RIP Lazy Links )

And the California Desert which took about 25% of the map adding Paradise Palms.

And other.. Off screen stuff we will get to that later.

Back to the map, stuff is coming back, a temple from the tomato tribe, a destroyed motel sign with the reason those stuff are coming back, the enforcers whom which are galactic police forces who noticed stuff out of place and gave us the motel sign back... Yay

( RIP MOTEL )

But something wasn't right, the rift in the sky is getting really small and turning color.

Soon after lighting started to strike what people call cactus mountain.

And out of nowhere, Kevin as the community called him. Enter the scene and here we see the second power change

Rifts &gt;&gt; Kevin

Kevin went on a trip around the map "" destroying "" areas of the map, well not really destroy 

The Rift in the sky was losing it's power, so it had to act quickly, it started to take a physical form and implant itself In the core of the map to survive and keep its ability to collide worlds.

Once Kevin has done its job, it had to start the process of moving its power to the map

So it took loot lake as a camp to wait.

Process two started and after Kevin travelled again around the map.

It was time to move on to become a bigger thing than just a cube.

The butterfly event as it was called was Kevin saying goodbye to his cube form.

After that people thought Kevin was gone.
But let me ask them, for what ?

Loot Lake ? No.


Kevin is the Map.


People started to see something In the distance soon enough, it was an ice berg that the rifts had brought and it started getting closer until

Season 7

After A.I.M's Research was done, the ice berg was close and ready for impact.

Destroying Flush and freezing Greasy, Polar Peak started to melt by the day, until we could tell there was a fight and arguing, few days later, a prison with someone kept captive and his followers frozen so they don't hatch, the Ice King woke to harvest the power that made him come here to end the Real thread, The fire King. but time was not on his side as the fire king have escaped and was regaining his powers slowly.


It was time, the fire king regained his power and was slowly calling for a base, the started to call for the Volcano, from a help from his old friend, Kevin.


See the cube didn't just bring random stuff, he was bringing an old friend.


The cracks started to disturb players and even destroyed some buildings, iconic buildings non the less.

And it went silent. A volcano was spawning, workers were moving a block from where it was due to changes in the environment and some were rebuilding a tower that got destroyed... Again.


Sgt. Winter Decided to destroy his inventions before it destroyed him and EVERYONE else.

Pirates were spotted on the North Coast of the island and they quickly started to raid the island of its treasure when they found rivals.

The fire king was hatching his followers and the Ice King finally decided to take action and do something about his enemy by finding a weapon that can take him down.



But we just have to wait, to see what happens next and what's under X marks the spot, the frozen legends.


To sum this up.

Space Power came to island and managed to call for an ally to come help it reach its goal whatever it is

Kevin the Cube is still Alive.

And the meteor is the reason of the volcano.

The meteor Is the reason of Rifts

The meteor is the reason of Kevin

The meteor is the game.



But that's just a theory.
A ga...

I assumed they either wanted to play duos (they might've thought I was good) or they were going to sent hate. The latter, of course, occurred. I accept and message him ""Hello?"", he responds with ""nice lowground warrior. Turtle every fight LOL"" I immediately recognize the fight he was talking about. He had highground so I just played lowground because everytime I attempted to take highground he would just do 3 90s up, making it impossible to do so. He goes on to talk about my stats (they're not bad, my season 8 KD is around 15% WR and 3.9 KD) and how they compare to his stats. He had 900 wins by the way, I have 200 (400 if you include PS4).

&amp;#x200B;

He talked about how I was a lowground warrior ""bot"" and I insisted that highground doesn't mean you automatically win and that he should try shooting back. He would never address this argument, just kept saying my KD is trash and that I got lucky with my 14 kill game. I tried explaining how there are different strategies but he ""hates players like me"". Which I don't understand. It's literally impossible to take highground from these freaks. Like I said, everytime I attempted to, he would just 90 up again, so I would go back down and start hacking away at the structure. What else am I going to do, build battle him to the sky limit, and then get shot down?? I killed him because I snaked round the back and shot him with his back turned because he didn't protect his sides. Then stsrting swearing at me for no reason, and then called me 14 and insisted to 1v1 me in Creative and that I should go ""play tetris"" (why though???). He finished with ""bot"" before blocking me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't understand what goes through people's heads when they are fighting someone and die to them? They must think that highground is literally everything, and that if you have it the other player should just ""die"" because it's not like he's going to give it up? There were multiple opportunities that he could have killed me simply by jumping down, but he insisted on keeping the highground.

So I have an idea for season 10 as a sort of special season to recap the previous seasons. 

# Map Changes: 


So the map starts off by being in the state it is at the end of season 9, which involves a device that can manipulate time (from here on referred to as the TTD for time travel device). Once season 10 begins, the map will actually start regressing at an accelerated rate. 

So week 1 of season 10 involves going back from how season 9 ended, to how season 8 ended, and week two does the same but for season 8. In week 3 we see the volcano and temple area disappear and wailing woods return, and so on and so forth until week 10 when we're back to the season 1 map. On week 10, the area outside of the map starts to warp into a strange abyss, with the map disappearing and instead we have a bunch of islands from previous seasons all strangely cut out of their past periods, like revelations from black ops 3 almost. (At this point, the default skins will instead all be the enforcer skin, but only for this week). 


Throughout season 10, there will be map evidence of the characters from past seasons banding together to fix the issues with the map. Like the visitor and A.I.M. working together to keep drift from vanishing and being sent back to our world, and the prisoner and calamity fighting enforcers. Likewise parts of the map will be preserved in time, like the bock which needs to stay in the game for obvious reasons, but will require portals or a bridge of sorts to access. 



Then on the dawn of season 11, we see all the characters of the previous 10 seasons introduced to a whole new map completely original and different to the last 10 seasons. 


# Battle Pass:


The battle pass for season 10 would work just like previous seasons, with some minor changes. 


It would still have a bunch of new skins, but instead of two skins off the bat, there would be one skin and a series of challenges to unlock new variants for past skins (Blast from the past challenges (BftP))


# BFTP: 

Each week it'd become possible to complete a challenge of the corresponding season: 

Season 9: Week 1: New skin for ??? 

Season 8: Week 2: BlackHeart receives a new skin. 

Season 7: Week 3: Zenith receives a new skin.

Season 6: Week 4: Calamity gets a new skin. 

Season 5: Week 5: Drift receives a new skin, showing his body is fading away. 

Season 4: Week 6: Carbide receives a new skin. 

Season 3: Week 7: Rust Lord Receives a new skin. 

Season 2: Week 8: Sparkle Specialist receives a new skin. 

Season 1: Week 9: New skin is released called “OG default” which allows players to equip their default character design, as after this season all the default character models will change to new ones. 

Season 0: Week 10: idk be imaginative. 



After the BFTP, there would be a series of new lobby musics to acquire like the OG musical rewards, as well as new variants of older emotes like take the L, and new styles for bonesy and hamerez. 


At the end of the BP, a new skin called “Father Time” would be the tier 100 prize. 
It'd be a reactive skin that would change it's age over the course of the game.  
It wouldn't have bonus challenges though, it would have more unlockable variants for previous season's week-7 secret unlock characters (Return of the Legends (ROTL)) 


# ROTL: 

Season 10: ??? 

Season 9: ??? 

Season 8: ??? 

Season 7: The prisoner fully decked out in proper clothing. 

Season 6: A.I.M. would have new variants. 

Season 5: Enforcer has new variants. 

Season 4: The visitor has new variants. 

Season 3: John Wick in white. 

Season 2: The dark knight, but in white. 

Season 1: Bright Bomber but she's mutated by the time travel. 





Also, for those wondering, if you do not own the original form of this skin, you ONLY unlock the new variant so OGs needn't worry. 



Thoughts? Just something I thought would be nice to do and would be almost like a reunion of sorts.

I wouldn’t say I’m loads better than him, but I often put more work in during a game just because of differences in play styles and whatnot. I’m much more aggressive while he likes to sit back. I end up not wanting to play with him as much cause I’ll take the brunt of the fight, deal at least 150+ damage to both players (in some cases, sometimes maybe only one and 75-100 to the other) but he’ll come in and scoop up both kills. It’s makes me more mad now since the health update, where I’ll take 75 damage or so from fighting two players and he’ll be full health/shield and still just finish em off.
What can I/we do to stop this from happening so much?
When I sit back and wait for him, I notice myself not getting the advantage in the fight, and making it a lot harder to bop em in general.


TL;DR:
My friend always takes my kills in situations where I’m clearly not gonna die. What should I do?

Just to put this out there, I'm trash (I have a .5 KD). I know I'm trash, I just like to have fun, just play casually, maybe get a meme in. But it's become unplayable. I play on EU servers, which are meant to be quite chill, but 6 games in a row I've made top 5 in solos and the other 4 are either in a Max height build fight, spamming pyramids, or continuing a chain of turtles that started in zone 4. And then there's the people that camp out with a pump at the NESW signs (for week 2 challenges) waiting for a cheap kill. I can't even drop junk junction (yes I know) without a 300 mats build fight before zone 1. Apparently, if you're within render distance, you have offended them just by existing. There is no way to counter 'just build lol' except with a turret, but then the inevitable 4th party one pumps you to the back of the skull. Anything that slightly counters sweats have been vaulted or nerfed to oblivion (planes can still die though) as the pro players start crying. Also it's almost impossible to win a fight without a pump - I don't see how this is much different to spray and pray in S5. There has to be a ranked mode soon to help the new or casual players who just want to have fun and to also help the soccer skins and the streamers who want a challenge. The skill ceiling is so high now it curves backwards i.e. unassailable. For the sake of the 90% of people who want to play a fun game, add a ranked mode.

When a player enters the circle, they electrocute the player and do 100 damage, and then take 5 seconds to recharge. To destroy it, This trap is different as each rock is its own component and need to be destroyed individually.  Each rock as 100 health, so a dynamite blast will do it and for each rock destroyed, the damage of the circle decreases by 5 and the AOE is also changed accordingly. The last rock as about a 2-5 metre radius of effect. To tell if it's a trap, watch it and see if any electricity flickers and it hums when close by. It will also make a louder noise when charging and can be used 5 seconds after placement.

Imagine if you will the game we play is not Fortnite but we meet up and go down the local park for a game of football with the neighborhood kids, great fun. Then one afternoon a professional football player comes to play with us and schools us all. Soon that one professional player turns into 10 and soon 30% or more people who live and breath the game 8 hours a day 7 days a week are all coming down and slaying everyone. All of a sudden going down to the local park having a game with my friends is a continuous slaughter by these pros. Not fun.

I yearn for a time when I can play the game with my friends and not have to worry about several squads of people who play the game 8 hours a day 7 days a week.

I don't care who you are, if you put 8 hours a day in any given interest you're going to get amazing at it.

Please for the love of god separate the streamers from the majority of people who work or study full time, we just don't have the time to get the muscle memory these people have.

Perhaps add an ""hours played"" or ""Total wins"" algorithm to the matchmaking so people doing it for a living can do it with each other and the casual gamers can enjoy the game again.

- Improve replay mode
- Let people adjust their FOV
(Stretched screens are an unfair advantage that PC players have over console players. Allowing an adjustable FOV would allow console players to experience the game in their own way.)
- Make it quicker to load up Fortnite. The application takes way too long to get to the lobby.
- GREATLY reduce fall damage.
(Epic should’ve noticed that when they added Glider Redeploy in all game modes, that many positive responses came from not taking fall damage. NOBODY LIKES FALL DAMAGE. The only reason I think it should be in the game is to prevent players from making sky bases.)
- Fix the issue where players can take fall damage from sliding down a hill.
(It’s called FALL damage, not SLIDING damage.)
- Make structure health changes for wood to 100 starting/200 max hp, brick to 125 starting/400 max hp, and metal to 150 starting/600 max hp
- Increase small shield stack size back to 10
- Increase big shield stack size to 4
- Implement a 10 second immunity period where players cannot take damage while in the ‘Down but Not Out’ state
(Prevents players from “thirsting”, aka: finishing immediately.)
- LET CONSOLE PLAYERS ADJUST THE GRAPHIC SETTINGS
(Shadows, Effects, Textures, etc. PC Players can make changes to any number of these settings, resulting in higher frame rates, better gameplay, etc. AND THEY’RE ALREADY ON PC. Console players have a LIMIT of 60 fps, but Epic’s graphic settings can cause frame drops. So it’s not like console players are always playing at 60 fps. Aside from the comparison, it would just make sense to allow everyone to customize their video settings.)
- Have llamas drop 350,350,350 materials
(Midway between Epic’s change to 200 each material, and the former 500 each.)
- Increase the harvesting rate by 10%
(I understand that it was already increased by 40%. But 50% would help out alot in the early game. If someone lands, gets a gun, and I don’t, that 50% would allow more time to get away.)
- Cap each material at 750 instead of 500
(A material cap of 1500 total is not enough because materials are used for more than just fighting other players. We use mats to move around the map, which can sometimes take ALOT, and we use mats to buy stuff from vending machines. This low mat cap also hinders the quantity and quality of build battles. The only time I really notice other players engage in build battles is whenever they have the Glider Redeploy item. If the player was decent, I either die from a 3rd party shortly afterwards because we both used up our mats, or I have to waste time harvesting. When it’s late in the game, there is nearly no time to harvest, because the remaining players are either being over-aggressive, or waiting to catch someone off guard. At least before the nerf, I might have around 1.5k total mats or so if I was unable to loot. Now, I’d be lucky to have 1k even after I loot.)
- Increase player speed while gliding. It is way too easy to get beamed out of the air after you rift or use a launch pad.
- Have the player health bar deplete immediately instead of looking as if it’s draining when taking damage
- Increase spawn rate, and drop speed of supply drops
- Make the first storm circle smaller, decrease storm wait time, but decrease storm closing speed. In most games, after the first storm is done closing, there’s barely anybody alive. I’ve noticed there tends to be around 20 people left after the first circle has closed.
(With this change, the storm would move more often, but not as fast. Storm shouldn’t move so fast, that if you land somewhere like Paradise, you’d be SOL, but it should force people to rotate earlier, so that the remaining players will be closer to each other, and not spread throughout a whole map. This change would help speed up games.)
- Allow players to reload while aiming down sights (ADS)
- Adjust ammo stacks that drop from chests, ammo boxes, etc.
(Have shotgun ammo always drop in stacks of 10, small &amp; medium ammo always drop in stacks of 30, heavy ammo always drop in stacks of 7.)
- Adjust material stacks that drop as floor loot, from chests, etc.
(Have materials drop in stacks of 50. This is just enough to build a full 1x1 w/ a ramp.)
- Disable jumping fatigue
(I honestly do not understand the purpose of this feature.)
- Slightly increase player movement speed
(Maybe by 10-15%?)
- Increase bullet speed for projectile weapons
(The bullet travel time for projectile weapons are way too slow. Snipers are some of the most powerful weapons simply because of how fast the bullets move. If my crosshair is on somebody 30 meters away, they should not be able to duck or jump past the bullet when I fire my shot.)
- Decrease the amount of shotgun pellets from 10 to either 7 or 8
(The inconsistency with shotguns doesn’t come from a lack of damage, it comes from the pellet spread being too large. Shotguns having so much pellet spread is what made them so rage-inducing for the past few seasons before Epic buffed the pump damage. The state of shotguns is not nearly as bad now, but it’s still not where it should be. If I have a blue pump, there should be no reason that I pump someone for 198 damage if the max damage is 200. When people hit difficult shots, they should be rewarded. Decreasing the pellet spread is what would truly balance the state of shotgun damages.)
- Decrease pump shotgun pull-out time
(I’m not talking about the weapon switch delay. I am talking about the animation of a character pulling out their shotgun.)
- Fix the shotgun delay when players switch from building or editing mode to their shotgun
(If the only gun I have is a shotgun, then I shouldn’t have to worry about any “WEAPON SWITCH” delay.)
- Revert pump shotgun range to what it was before the 6.31 update. I’ve tested it out in Creative, and the change that Epic made in the 6.31 update has resulted in pump shotguns having around the same, if not less, range as tactical shotguns.
- Get rid of grey variation of the tactical shotgun
(The tac and pump should each spawn at the same rate. There is way too much variation with the spawn rates of shotguns. If a player lands in Tilted, gets a grey tac, and someone else gets a blue pump, that player will lose that fight ALMOST every time.)
- Bring back the purple tac shotgun, come up with a legendary semiautomatic shotgun variation. Doesn’t have to be a gold tac, but it can be.
(There should be more than just pump shotgun variants in the epic &amp; legendary categories.)
- Fix false hit markers
- Bring back bouncers, but change rarity to common(grey) so that they spawn more
(Making this change would introduce a more available form of non-RNG mobility. Hop rocks and shadow stones were great forms of mobility, but they were only temporary. Therefore, I have good reason to doubt that drift boards, cannons, and the volcanic vents will stay in the game. Quad crashers are a nice form of mobility, but they are not as easy to find, and they are way too loud.)
- Change spike trap damage to 100 per trap
- Have a fixed amount of materials that can come from items.
(For example: I shouldn’t get 32 wood from one tree, and 36 wood from another tree, when they are the exact same tree, and both are at full health.)
- Gain 25 effective health from kills instead of the +50.
(I personally love this addition to the game, but I do acknowledge that +50 is too high. A player only needs 2 kills for 100 shield to start off a game. If someone were to land in Tilted, it could simply come down to who is lucky enough to get a pump first. With the the current state of the loot pool in Fortnite, the other player may get something extremely ineffective. 2 kills out of a whole building, when you are the only person with a pump is not a very challenging situation. If someone wants to earn shield from kills, it shouldn’t be so easy. I believe that skill should be rewarded, but certain aspects of the game, like earning health from kills, should at least be challenging.)
- Decrease explosives’ radius, and explosives’ damage to structures 
(Explosives were somewhat weak before the 4.50 update, but after that, explosives were too strong, and they have been too strong ever since.)
- Adjust 3rd person POV angle so the in-game character model doesn’t block the crosshair while ADS in close-range
- Decrease quad crasher volume for user(s)
(When I am riding on a quad crasher, I can barely hear my teammates in voice chat, even with my voice chat volume turned all the way up. I should not have to turn down my in-game SoundFX volume to communicate with my teammates just because of one aspect of the game.)
- Fix the glitch where weapons constantly shoot without a player hitting the trigger. Usually happens when building, or editing too fast on controller.
(Might exclusively be a console bug, I’m not sure if controller on PC players also encounter this bug too.)
- The loot pool in Fortnite is insanely overcrowded, and I believe the following changes would help to clean it up: Vault balloons, Vault scoped revolver, Vault turrets, Vault scoped assault rifle, Vault thermal assault rifle, Vault Gliders, Vault Minigun, Vault standard pistol, Vault blue suppressed pistol, Vault the common (grey) AR, Vault the blue Heavy AR, Vault the common SMG, Vault the blue dual pistols, Vault the purple hand cannon
- Either vault the infantry rifle, or get rid of the uncommon (green), and common (grey) variants
(The spawn rate for infantry rifles are WAY too high.)

Starting playing in S2. When I started I saw some people with really cool skins and thought, hey I should get some too. Fast foward to S4 and I have almost every skin I could buy within those two seasons. Now, i'm not saying that i'm proud of that, but there is something special about older skins that skins released today do not have. They are the beginning. They are from the time where building a 1x1 and using a simple ramp and wall push was the \*new\* meta. Nowadays, skins do not have the same simplicity and they don't have the same feel of genuine care and design. Mostly the skins that are put out during the last few seasons  seem rushed, too sophisticated, and almost too much in terms of design. Some skins are great, Fishstick and bandolette for example. My main reason for this post is that I believe there should be some cut back on the release of older skins. My reasoning is that it would lead to some eternal value and a special feeling for the people that played back when these skins were released. To see a rotation almost everyday of one or more skins that released in S2/3/4 makes me feel as though I should not have bought the skins at the time because I could have just waited and got them one of the days in S8. I do agree with releasing older skins. I believe the release of Skull Trooper was a great move. I do not think that releasing older skins almost everyday is healthy for the people that put a decent amount of money in the game from the beginning. What is the incentive to buy skins when we know they will be released again in two-four weeks? Some skins I bought recently had a bit of time before they were released again (Maven, Fishstick, Lace) but I knew that they would be released again and when they did I just had the thought of why should I even buy new skins anymore if they are so easy to get? That is where the post stemmed from. What was even the point of buying the Munition Expert back then when its release is fairly common even in S7 and S8? Make new re-skinned original 8. That is what I would buy. Make the older skins releases less frequent, so when they release again people will think, ""This is an old skin, I should buy it now before I can't get it for awhile."" This will make the players who played in the first half of the game's life \*content\*. I still expect you to release old skins, but just do it at a less frequent rate so when I play the game I can feel good about the money I spent. Now I understand why people were upset about the Christmas skins re-releasing so many times. It makes them not special anymore. ",FortNiteBR

I used to believe that the model of supply and demand was fine. Make us wait that little bit longer so that we’re more inclined to make a purchase when items do return, but the wait for an item you want can be so substantial these days that you no longer want to/can be bothered to purchase an item you want. 

I’ve been sitting on 4800 V-Bucks for nearly two months now. I’ve predominately been waiting for Brilliant Striker. The problem is that there are so many cosmetics that *could* potentially come back soon so I might not even bother purchasing Brilliant Striker when she does come out just in case something else returns that I might want. The cycle goes on. I don’t know if I’ll ever spend these V-Bucks...

We need a bigger store. Ironically, a bigger store could see an *increase* in sales purely because people are seeing more of what they want more frequently, so they feel like they can make a purchase without worrying about when another cosmetic will return. 

From an aesthetic point of view, the store looks outdated anyway. It doesn’t match the rest of the updated menus. It’s only a small gripe and something that shouldn’t be a priority over bug fixes and optimisation, but it’s just a thought.",FortNiteBR

It should be a weekly thing.","I've been wanting a ranked mode since, uh, basically the moment I stopped playing LTMs specifically and started trying solos. After a few sessions gauntlet is EXACTLY what I wanted from ranked.

Sooo if there are any noobs reading this, here's why u should give it a try. 

**1. You get points for every single elimination.** Unlike previous tournaments where you only got elim points at 3+ kills, *every* fight you win now gets you a point. This means you are rewarded for pushing fights and being more aggressive, which is also how you will get better at the game. It also means if you're a player who usually gets less than 3 kills, you can still push fights and earn points for elims vs just playing for placement (which is boring and does not help u improve). 

**2. Losing to a way more skilled player with 10+ kills is less frustrating.** Because of the points system, that player got at least 10 points for the game, so there's a good chance they will level up and out of your lobbies next game. 

**3. You will be in weak lobbies and see your bad habits in other weak players.** Nothing drives home how bad your bad habits are like seeing someone else doing them.. then getting beaten (by you). I saw lots of scared, passive players (def one of my bad habits, being too passive) which forced me to play more aggressive. In just a few matches, I feel like I learned a lot. *And* because there is point matching, you aren't likely to push a fight then get slaughtered instantly. 

SO to conclude this essay, Gauntlet is awesome. If you've never tried a tournament, TRY IT! And Epic PLEASE make this a regular part of the game. It's so, so fun. ",FortNiteBR

The community has moved completely past this mindset where if you die it’s because you’re bad, which is the truth, to if you die it’s because the other player was just trying too hard. This is extremely hypocritical, because now if someone actually puts some effort into becoming good, they are too sweaty. 

I completely understand the funny stereotype that soccer skins are sweaty, and try way too hard, honing their skills, practicing 90s every day to become the best, but I think this community is a little too harsh on the people who wear these skins. I hate sweats as much as the next guy, and as a player who has been playing since day one and has seen this game evolve into something far greater (or worse depends on how you see it) than anyone could’ve ever imagined,  I totally agree with those people who believe that sweaty players are what is ruining this game. But it is absolutely ridiculous to me how immature some people are that they literally threaten death to those who wear these damn sweaty soccer skins. I have posted now 3 clips wearing a soccer skin because of I love how customizable they are, and if I’m being honest, the skin makes me feel like a good player. Every time, no one pays any attention to the quality of the clip, and simply makes a comment about the fact how I deserve to die simply because of my fashion choices in a video game. I have received legit death threats for even daring to assume people on reddit would care about my clip, all because I’m a “sweaty soccer skin.” It’s honestly sad. 

This game is unlike any other game I have ever played. It is a phenomenal, addictive pleasure that has found a way to give a rewarding feeling for each and every time you play. But everyone, both sweaty and casual players included, needs to calm down a little bit. We can’t turn the game into a war between nerds and casuals, because then neither one of them is innocent of not trying too hard. If we can all just agree that fortnite is in a crisis, where each and every public game is like a million dollar scrim game, then we can band together to make fortnite great again. If you care enough about the state of the game to read this far, then I applaud you. You are truly one of the mature people on this subreddit. I don’t expect this to gain any traction, but I figured I had to put my opinion out into the world somehow. Thank you for your time.

As trials go, it is ridiculously short. With work I got three games yesterday and might get a couple in tonight. I would imagine this is the same for most casual players so the only real metrics they are getting is from those who spend hours a day on the game and that sort of defeats the object.

Future runs should have an average score per game rather than a total. I could pick up 100 points over 50 games and be ranked the same as someone who has picked up 100 points over 5 games. Again, this defeats the object of having ranked. 

Finally, I would silently run it against all modes (including large teams)  for a time so whenever they bring in permanent ranked or other ranked events, players already have their scores logged to prevent an unbalanced start.

I will say though that the games I have had in Gauntlet have been much more enjoyable than I have had lately. Yeah, the first one saw me die quickly after getting swamped by three (in the solo version) but the other two brought back that old Fortnite buzz.",FortNiteBR

So this brings me on to my main point. Bring back the old fortnite, as an LTM. Classic and unvaulted gave us a nice nostalgic feel because of some of the guns that we haven't used In so long. However, an OG or Original (or something like that) LTM would bring us the old fun we all wanted. I don't mean, put all the old textures in the game , because that could mess with the current modes severely. I mean, recreate the old map with the new textures. Put the factories back at dusty. All the main locations. Maybe add the locations from either season 1 or season 2. Turn off turbo building. Add the old minimap in, if possible, for nostalgia sake. I know everyone hated this, but add the double pump back, just because it was there in season 1. Add all the season 1 - 2 guns (if changing the rarities affects them, just add them , don't change the rarities). Put the old victory royale screen on when getting a win. Remove all vehicles. Again, just as a limited time mode. This would be so much fun. 

I've been playing since season 2. It's been a very fun ride. Let's have more fun.

My friends and I were playing fortnite on console (Xbox) not in a cross-platform lobby. After eliminating a squad, the clip shows my friend get knocked out of no where. After I revived him and we were searching for the enemy, both my friend and I get knocked at **the same exact time**. Shortly afterward, I get eliminated and my friend gets revived again. It doesn't show it in the initial clip but 2 other squad members get knocked and eliminated by the same enemy. As my friend left Snobby he sees a guy running near the mountain and kills him. That was the enemy who eliminated 3 members of our squad. As you see in the first point of view, the enemy has no weapon but manages to knock me with 1 hit when I had 154 health.

The second part of the clip shows the enemies point of view from replay mode. I fast forwarded it to where the anonymous enemy eliminates my 2 other friends before dying to Nick. After watching the enemy's entire game in replay mode, he landed outside of snobby, within the general area he was found in and he never got a weapon. He just pick-axed the entire time.

I've never experienced this before on console fortnite. I figured this might be something you'd encounter in a PC **or** cross-platform lobby. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I don't think this is sever related. The enemy knocked Nick twice. Knocked and eliminated me and then proceeds to eliminate both the blue and purple squad members of my party.

In Last day of Season 4 I got Level 63 and oh boi how I was grinding in last days and spending v-bucks just to get Omega. In my thoughts it is the best Battle Pass Tier 100 skin in all fortnite. I am so pissed that Fortnite is not bringing back challenges. All seasons that HAD edit options had all time style challenges (Except for Season 4) and it is sad that my favorite skin that I grinded days and Nights. The sleep that I didn't have just to get Omega.I was hoping to get at least Level 65 in last 20 hours that I didn't got and lost sleep.

Ever  since building became the star of the game, the Tac Shotgun has lost  its power and I think that the weapon concept is just not fitting to how  the game plays. The fact that you need to be in people face - at the  risk of getting one pumped - while hitting for low damage might be the  reason behind it.

Now as the title says, my suggestion is to vault the tac and bring back the heavy in lower rarities (Maybe uncommon and rare)

The idea is to kind of copy how ARs (the only somewhat balanced section in my opinion) work:

The Standard AR is used because of its versatility, good FSA and ROF are the main aspects

Heavy AR is the Pump of the AR's, high damage but you can't spray and requires precise aim and good control of FSA

Silenced AR, similar to the standard but you lose some damage for the suppressor.

Infrantry Rifle, kind of similar to the Heavy AR this one can be called the Tac of the AR's. Vault it aswell.

With that in mind, Shotguns could be:

Pump, heavy hitter in close range, low fire rate and ability to one shot

Heavy Shotgun, Lower damage and higher range, decent fire rate.

What do you think? Hope it makes sense",FortNiteBR

Some awkward maneuvering later we were facing each other. He shot first, but only dealt 50 damage. I thought ""fine, this works"", shot second... And killed him immediately. I still feel bad for him. 

That is why I am going to pay it forward and not let his noble sacrifice go to waste! And if you have any heart you may consider to do the same. If you see a poor soul wandering about with a cannon, don't look away. Take one for the team.

\-Wear Stage 1 Black Heart (No Black Bling) to recognize if you need help with the challenge. (I feel most people would be wearing other stages at this point)

\-Team Rumble

\-Drop Lazy Lagoon or wherever the storm takes us with the closest canons.

\-Build a structure around the cannon.

\-Line Up to Shoot the Cannon or Be Shot At to help everyone with the challenge.

\-Respawn &amp; repeat to help out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On Console the Cannon aiming is really difficult.. for me at least! 

This all sounds logical in my head but not sure exactly how this will play out haha.

In fortnite if I want to build a wall I have to click whichever button the wall is assigned to (in may case Q) and then click left mouse button to place it.
Is there anyway that I can do that just by clicking Q?
This would make the noob builders better at building and increase the chances of winning against a streamer (btw) or a sweaty pros who just want that bloody win/kills by murdering noobs like me :(

Not that we were far apart, they just didn't understand what  video games meant for me and how the passion got started.  I remember my  daughters first kill when she only had grenades.  As her opponent  approached her he was firing shots that were landing but only body  shots.  I urged her to just start chucking them at the ground.  As he  closed in, he killed her but when he approached to get her materials the  last grenade went off and she killed him as she spectated.  It was  great!!

Yesterday after homework was  done we booted up the game.  We play Save the world then go to Battle  Royale.  When the game booted up a registration request was prompted.   We completed the registration to cooperate with what Epic was  requesting.

Once the screen loaded,  EVERYTHING WAS GONE!!  No Save the world!! None of the earned or paid  items were in Battle Royale.  Every skin, every glider, every  emote...GONE!!!

I am sure there is a  solution but can you imagine the face of a seven year old girl who has  learned how to play and has all that she has earned taken away from  her?!  I have sent my emails accordingly and I hope that it is a concern  that will be rectified, but as a father not being able to ""fix it"" in  the moment is upsetting and embarrassing.

All  we want is our stuff back!! There are a lot of good memories of fails,  wins, and ""did you see that?"" moments that will live well past the life  of Fortnite.

I don't have a corporate  lobby in my back pocket nor do I have high paid lawyers to make threats.   I don't care to be that guy either.  I just want to get back to having  fun with my daughters!!

EPIC do the right thing!!!",FortNiteBR

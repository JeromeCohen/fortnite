5,Martin1234Rulez,1537793882,9ihos6,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ihos6/is_kevin_really_done/,8,Is Kevin really done?,"Disclaimer: Some points in this thread are my own personal opinions and Epic has not confirmed these. Also, please do not downvote if you disagree, if you disagree just comment what you disagree with.

Well what do we know?

We know that a pink rift (different color from Earth-=-Fortnite rift opened and struck down 6 lighting bolts before sending down Kevin. Kevin was created as he gradually filled up from a unknown substance, this substance didn’t come from the rift however, which leads me to believe that it was some sort of dark matter which was able to be moulded because of the lighting.
Kevin then went around the map placing down Runes that created low gravity domes that bended physics, however these did not cause use to regenerate shield unlike Kevin. The runes obviously have some purpose and I feel like we haven’t received enough puzzle pieces to put that part together.

Now, the fact that Kevin gave us shield was quite interesting, Epic wouldn’t include this unless they had a reason to, they purposely made it a very slow rate to mimimalise the effect it has on gameplay but they still wanted to make the point clear. Another thing we need to focus on is how Kevin didn’t regenerate health, he just did shield, now this may be because the Enforcers don’t have health, as they could be Robots or another entity where their main health is infact shield.

Kevin only attacks if he feels threatened which indicates to me he is quite passive, however upon touching him you will be flung back, and if you attack him you will he flung back further and dealt damage.

Now there was a lot of focus on Kevin and he has a very long time in the Fortnite world with Fortniters only guessing what he would do next. Which leads me to conclude that he will return.

The fact that Kevin initialled went into the lake and dissolved is completely normal, it’s the fact that he (best way to describe it) scanned the lake before applying his propeties indicates that this was his destination and he didn’t accidentally fall in. Also going back to the shield since Loot Lake doesn’t give you shield it’s purpose is obviously different to Kevin’s alongside its glowing that can be seen from the battlebus, it isn’t around the edges but more making out a shape.

May I also point out that:

Week 10 loading screen showed Brite Bomber touching the cube and seeing Dark Bomber (Name confirmed by partially completed skin within the game files)

 If Epic are going to remove the rifts like they did with the hop rocks in Season 4 then whatever’s going to happen with Loot Lake will happen before Season 6

Early in the Season 5 battlepass there is a Spray paint called Crazy Castle with a castle as the spray (duh) and there was a image released by Epic where the photo was taken in Salty Springs. Between two mountains you should have been able to see Loot Lake instead you could see a castle.

TL:DR 
If something’s going to happen, it’s going to happen soon, probably involving Loot Lake, Crazy Castle and Kevin

This shouldn't be happening in a crate that spawns a limited of times per game and is supposed to be end-game loot. In games like PUBG and H1Z1, if I see a crate, I want the items in it, either because you can only get them from the crate, or because there will be a guaranteed good item in the crate. At the moment, a Supply Drop just feels like a chest with an extra medical item spawn in it. I think we should think of some ideas in the comments of how we can make Supply Drops worth it, and make people fight over them, instead of just leaving them astray because of the uncertainty of if it will be good or not.  


My idea is that we remove all rocket launchers and grenade launchers from floor and chest spawns and make them exclusive to supply drops. This will make people want to fight over the Supply Drop because they need that item to have a better chance at winning. Imagine seeing a Supply Drop if they did this, no one would have a rocket or grenade launcher yet, so they would want to go over to the drop, so would other people, making them all fight to get the airdrop. This would make the supply drop more wanted and create fights to see who gets the items which can help them win. We should also maybe take out some items like the deagle and snipers to make them also worth while.

I think people would vary their loudout if they know they can progress towards something. Imagine unlocking something like the Easter Grenade Launcher or the Halloween pumpkin rocket launcher after finishing a current challenge for those weapons.

I think it would spice up the gameplay and create more variety wich causes more fun as people would stick to hard to just 1 meta.

The next item has to be the rift to go because I'm just tired of people using them to run away or just dive on me from behind. Next is the port a fortress and if they don't get rid of it at least have the metal build and not be instant. I also wish the p90 and smg would get vaulted and the tac smg would come back. In other words yeah throw season 5 in the trash.

It's crazy on Xbox (not sure about other platforms) how many times in the heat of battle I accidentally rotate my ramps! Gets me killed so many times, an easy solution would be just put a toggle in the settings to RESET ROTATE PIECE and let us select ON if we wish.

This would mean if you accidentally rotate your ramp you simple go back to combat mode and then hit build mode and your Ramps are reset!

In my opinion this is much better than all the crazy suggestions I see every day, please consider adding this feature!",FortNiteBR

***My thoughts on the Mats:***  


Wood:  
 A person should not be able to Spam a wood wall and eat multiple clips, only can be countered by waiting for them to run out of mats or rush and get insta-killed by a double barrel.

&amp;#x200B;

Brick:  
 Should have more base health than Wood, but build maybe 1.5 or 2 times slower than wood.

&amp;#x200B;

Metal:  
It should be the go to, when in a gunfight, if you want to be safe from gunfire i feel you should have to actually take time and farm for it.  


At the current moment there is no real reason for there to be 3 different Materials unless they all serve a different purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

And while we are talking about Season 6, Vault the Fucking Double barrel, it takes literally no Brains to use it

So if these are the explosives we have to play with, then there should be fall off damage based on how far you are from the explosions center. It's extremely counter intuitive to take the same amount of damage when you're standing right in the center of the explosion, as you would standing 10 feet to the right of it. For example: a direct hit still deals 100-120, and the further away you get from the explosion the damage lessens.

Epic had such a great opportunity. The season 4 storyline was great. The visitor breaking space and time was interesting and the event was so amazing. The buildup after the event was great. The tiny rifts teleporting objects from the island to earth. They had this whole “Worlds Collide” idea and it was great.

Season 5 comes out and the “Worlds Collide”. The California Desert is in the island, a Viking village, a golf course, and some Easter island heads. After this, it seems like the rifts are just forgotten about, even though it’s the whole storyline of season 5. 7 weeks go by and nothing happens. Nothing to do with what happened in season 4 and nothing is happening with the rifts. Then finally we get the week 7 and 8 loading screens and it shows the enforcers, which we still know nothing about. Also the tomato head is back, which apparently was teleported to some ancient civilization.

Then the cube spawns and the rift is gone. The cube moves for about 3 weeks, and places 7 runes that create anti gravity domes. The cube then dissolves in loot lake and changes loot lake.

There are so many questions that are unanswered. Where is the visitor? Is space and time fixed? Why does the cube exist? What is the dark reflection? Why didn’t Epic focus on “Worlds Collide?”

TLDR: Why didn’t epic focus on the “Worlds Collide” and the space and time idea? Do you think season 5 was disappointing or great? ",FortNiteBR

You can search up loot lake volcano and find hundreds of live streams. The only reason they think it will be loot lake is well because everyone hates it but it’s become such a popular spot after the cube incident. Then again epic doesn’t care about popular spot cough cough tilted building. Within two weeks the building was loved by everyone. Well most people who landed tilted. But this was clearly a troll. Storyline developers were hoping for a answer. An answer that has yet to come. An answer that we will have to wait for. But back to the topic loot lake volcano ah yes let me get right to the point. It’s not going to happen. They want to reward in game storyline developers not data miners who just see a file and say “hey everyone there’s a volcano in loot lake”. I myself have looked at this leaked file (through a twitter post) and I didn’t see one mention of loot lake. Just volcano and volcanic pit (not exactly what the files say but close enough to get the point). So to finish it off loot lake volcano is a no but I didn’t necessarily say no volcano. So basically volcano is dusty

My mommy didn't hire me a video game tutor to make me into a professional gamer.

I do not play this game with an audience for a living, or even with an audience as a hobby.

I am a filthy casual. I play to have *fun.* **GASP WHAT A SHOCKER.**

Or at least, to *try* and have fun. Why am I not having fun in FBR?

Because every match I'm thrown into the same arena as Streamers, Pro Gamers, and other overtryhards, people who play this game **professionally.**

I've made countless top 4's with stupid stealth strats and just avoiding conflict, *but the other remaining players are always professionals.* The only reason I have 3-4 wins at all (since the start of season 4) is because the only remaining enemy wasn't a professional.

I am not a professional FBR player. I am a professional photographer.

Would you feel good submitting photography against mine in a contest if you aren't a professional? I wouldn't blame you if you didn't. It might still have been fun taking the pictures, but when you don't stand a chance to win from the beginning, is the end result still fun?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not for me. Being 'outskilled' from the beginning of every match sucks, and FBR needs **something** to close the skill gap between professionals and casuals. Either:

&amp;#x200B;

A) More intensive Matchmaking stipulations, factoring eliminations so low elim players don't end up fighting high elim players.

&amp;#x200B;

B) 'Streamer Mode' puts players into the 'Streamer Arena'.

C) Both

There was no storyline at all, season 4 loading screens were all about the storyline between omega and carbide and there were weekly map changes. This season all we've got is loading screens of drift and brite bomber smashing. Map changes were boring.

This sounds like some sort of salty rant, but honestly it isn't. I just feel like if the SMGs and Explosives were temporarily disabled, it could lead to some interesting statistics to see just how spam-dependent players nowadays really are. Sadly, too many of them are. Every fight consists of constant spamming of C4s and SMGs. Disabling both of them temporarily could be a little spark of life, in my honest opinion. SMG/Explosive spam has kinda ruined the game for me. I went from playing for days on end to playing 2-3 matches and being sick of spam.

Heres a idea on a possible future storyline. Who knows, I could be a psychic.

Season 1: Nothing interesting

Season 2: (knight themed) New locations (not really relevant at all to story)

Season 3: (space themed) Heres where the storyline really begins. Players started to notice a odd blue light in the sky and over the weeks in started to get bigger and bigger until we could tell it was 100% a meteor. I could go into the all the theories but i’ll just cut it short. Everybody thought it was hitting Tilted. But they were wrong! In the upcoming days to season 4 meteors start appearing in the sky. Gradually these start hitting the ground, then season 4 hit us.

Season 4: (superhero themed)The meteor hit Dusty and there are superheroes and villains. Ofcourse they turn out to be actors but that doesn’t matter for now. There are small craters everywhere with ‘hop rocks’ in them and over the weeks the craters start to get patched up. The meteor is slowly cracked away and their turns out to be a pod inside, which contained an alien from space. This alien which we now know as the Visitor turns the prop rocket into a real one. Long story short the rocket launches, goes through a rift above tilted, appears back above Moisty (which is now the desert),  flys through the map, goes through a rift beside a mountain, (which is now viking village) and appears above loot lake wnd crashes into the sky leaving a crack behind. Things start disappearing into portals around the map like the durr burger head, tomatohead, motel sign and lonely lodge sign. Then towards the end of season 4 things start appearing. A viking anchor, a animal’s bones and a cowboy’s carriage all appear around the map.

Season 5: (Summer themed season I guess?) Honestly nothing really happens til the end. We get a desert, golfing area and a viking village. But slowly the crack in the sky shrunk and on week 7 it started shooting lightning at a rock formation. It destroyed all cacti around the rock and in its final strike left a cube. The cube rolled around the map, created 7 runes with anti-gravity fields and it rolled into loot lake for a pretty cool event which turned loot lake into a bounce arena. Nonetheless it was pretty boring for how hyped up it was. Thats all we know for sure happened up to the date im writing this.

Season 6: (This is all a theory and anything past this point is NOT fact) 
(magical and mysterious themed) Loot lake might be renamed to Leap Lake and recoloured on the map, the anti gravity fields could enlarge and a futuristic city could be built in one. Loot lake’s water could spread across the river flowing through the map and without proper water no vegetation could grow. In the build up to season 7 grass could disappear and the island could be abandoned and left to rot.

Season 7: (post-apocalyptic themed) There is no grass and trees are without leaves, cities and towns are abandoned and the water that used to be there would still be pink cube water. Tilted towers’ buildings are dirty and broken, like other towns too. The secret week 7 skin would be an alien with a water hose as a back bling. This alien would spray back all the water and we will see vegetation grow back.

Season 8: (alien themed) 
The map is colonised by aliens and the old buildings are demolished and turned futuristic and high tech. The battle pass skins might be aliens too. But there is one town they didnt demolish, Greasy Grove. Later on in the season the aliens build a lab around it and research the people and do experiments on them. One of these experiments turns them into husks. The husks break out and cause the husk apocalypse that we see in STW

Season 9: (the end)
Battle royale turns out to be a STW prequel and STW becomes free. The map is left as it is, no more seasons. It would be the end.


Once again I will say, this is NOT fact. Just a theory of mine.

Ever since SMGs became so prevalent in the meta, the LMG has become one of the most useless guns in the game. It's a sort of AR/SMG hybrid - like the Drum Gun - that doesn't do a good job of either. The spread is too wild to work as an AR, but the rate of fire isn't good enough for it to work as an SMG. It doesn't even shred structures as well as a minigun, rendering it useless. It's the kind of gun you might pick up at the beginning of the game out of sheer desperation, then drop the second you find something better. It especially has no place in a loadout if you already have an AR, SMG, Shotgun, Sniper and meds/grapple etc

So personally, I think the LMG should be vaulted. It's next to useless and does the job of several other guns, except worse. I don't think I've even seen someone using an LMG this season, let alone get killed by one.

**Next, the Hand Cannon...**

Another weapon that isn't in a good place is the Hand Cannon. It has the potential for high damage but the accuracy requires you to be stood almost perfectly still. If you're close enough to someone to be using a Hand Cannon, you shouldn't be stood still. And if you're far enough to be safe standing still, why aren't you using a sniper or hunting rifle?

Personally - and I emphasise that this is just a suggestion - I think a good way to make the HC more relevant and useful would be to buff the accuracy and firerate, perhaps at the cost of damage. Being able to quickly land 3 60 damage shots (as opposed to the current 78 at legendary status) would be significantly more useful than only being able to land one 78 damage shot before switching to something else.

As a side thought, turning the HC into a sort of pistol version of the Heavy Sniper (maybe wall piercing??) would be pretty neat.

The Enforcers are dimensional police, enlisted with the job of closing rifts that are not meant to be opened. On their planet, they survive with a lower gravity (similar to say, the moon). 

The Visitor, an experienced and high ranking Enforcer, discovers how easy it is to use dimensional rifts to teleport between dimensions. He begins to experiment with rifts, opening and closing them, jumping through and into other dimensions. 
The Enforcers finally figure out the Visitor's crimes, and realize they must punish him for what he has done. Here is where the theory splits into two possible paths with one final solution.

1. To escape the Enforcers, the Visitor places himself in an escape pod. To gain momentum (similar to the rocket), he must fire the capsule at a fast rate into a dimensional rift. While firing the pod at a very fast rate, the debris of the Enforcer's world creates a meteor like rock surrounding the escape pod, as the Visitor flies through the dimensional rift, into Fortnite's.

2. The Enforcers place the Visitor in a capsule not intended to be open, sealing him up and away forever. They send the Visitor through a rift, creating once again, a meteor from the debris collecting on the sides of the escape pod. The Visitor is now heading for Fortnite's world.

The Visitor crash lands in the middle of Dusty Divot. Vindertech (either the government of the Fortnite world, or a very rich/influential company) decides to set up a facility around the meteor after realizing it might be more extraterrestrial than the first thought. How do I know this is Vindertech? Well, the golden circle symbols on the sides of the trucks/cars bringing the hop rocks out of the divot and on the sides of the metal soldiers in Omega's army (I'll get to that later) is the same symbol for Vindertech in Save the World. 

Anyway, Vindertech excavates the meteor, releases the capsule, the Visitor escapes (whether he was meant to escape or not, he does). It can be assumed that the Visitor forces Vindertech to take the hoprocks (using the trucks) to the villain base. Hop rocks are residual rocks that broke off of the meteor, and retained their low gravity material from Visitor's world.

Vindertech uses the Carbide vs. Omega movie to distract the public from the meteor/crater. A (prop or real, either way, it works in the end) rocket is constructed for the movie. We know this because the rocket is here since day 1, not after the Visitor shows up. The visitor did not build the rocket. 

The Visitor eventually powers up the rocket using hop rocks, and uses his knowledge of dimensional travel to gain momentum and finally escape back to his home world.

The Enforcers, later in S5, realize what the Visitor has done. They capture the Visitor once more, and restore ""balance and order"" of what was destroyed by the Visitor (motel sign, Tomato temple, etc.). The Enforcers realize that they will need to get rid of the Visitor once more, but with more protection this time. As they realize the capsule was able to be opened, they place the Visitor inside of a purple energy cube formed by the Enforcers (hence why it took so long for it to appear, it took a while for the Enforcers to create the cube). They eventually build up enough power to TELEPORT the cube through the dimensional rift in the fortnite world. We know it teleports because the lightning strike hits the ground, and the cube almost sort of builds itself up into the world. This mimics the way players load back into the lobby after dying in game, bottom to top before fully forming.

The Visitor is now stuck inside the cube. The Enforcers give the cube properties that blast or attack anyone who tries to open it or inspect it. This is where the theory once again hits a fork in the road. 

1. The Enforcers program the cube to make its way to Loot Lake, knowing that the cube will melt when it reaches, killing the Visitor inside. They create low gravity domes to make the cube lighter and easier to move. If the cube sits in the low gravity dome for long enough, it absorbs the low gravity energy and becomes lighter and quicker to move. These rune placements directly parallel the hop rock trucks making their way to the rocket.

2. The Visitor, now trapped inside this cube, begins to move the cube around the map. He too, must know that putting the cube in Loot Lake will melt it. He knows that if he makes it to Loot Lake, his prison will melt and he will be freed once more. He creates anti gravity domes to mimic his home planet to keep the cube going and easier to move, before finally making it to Loot Lake. He uses the bounci-ness of the lake to create a film over the lake, trapping himself under the lake similar to how ice shelters fish during the winter. He is now powering himself up to escape once more, hence the pulsating anti gravity domes.

I know this is a long theory, so I'll include a TL;DR

TL;DR: Visitor is an Enforcer gone rogue, gets sent through a dimensional rift in a capsule not intended to be opened for his punishments, Vindertech opens capsule, Visitor escapes in rocket, gets captured again, gets put inside a cube that attacks anyone who gets near it to avoid the cube being opened, Visitor heads to loot lake to melt the cube and trap himself under the water to plan his escape once more.

How it can be used:
It would allow you to trade 1 of your skins for 1 of someone else's skins. Duplicate skins will not be allowed.

How it can be obtained:
You need to complete all 10 weeks of challenges on the season, to receive 1 trade token. The trade token can only be used to trade 1 skin.


People would only be able to make 1 trade every 2 months and they would have to work hard to obtain the token. 

How it would work:
I grind all 10 weeks of challenges to receive my trade token. I find another person who has a trade token and is willing to trade.
For example: I will offer my Sparkle Specialist for his Brilliant Striker. We both accept trades, and we exchange the skins, both lose our trade tokens. Now we wait till next season and grind all 10 weeks of challenges for another trade token to make a trade.

I personally think this would be pretty interesting, and I could definitely see this not losing much money for Epic at all since you can only make 1 trade every season. I have a Bunny Brawler (1500vbucks) which I would love to get rid of in exchange for a 1200 vbuck skin.

When the killer clown phase had begun I was absolutely too afraid to leave my house to the point where it affected my social life in case a clown had come out of nowhere

&amp;#x200B;

Now when I am playing the game and see a clown it makes me too terrified to move and just shocks me in a way where I can't comprehend what's going around me.

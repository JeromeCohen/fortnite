No bug exists and shotguns are very consistent.  Even very good players make this mistake and think the game somehow screwed them instead of them just missing their shot then they complain on stream and everyone in their chat gets confirmation that all those low damage shots they're getting isn't them missing but just bad luck!

Heres an example of one of these cases:

https://clips.twitch.tv/AgitatedVainAubergineEagleEye

He takes the shot thinks it's good and gets low damage.  He mentions several times how his aim was right on

but heres where his aim was:  https://i.gyazo.com/dc709c6b905cb2318e1ff42ac3f77577.mp4

There is no shotgun inconsistency except for extreme outliers (the kind that you might get once every few months).  If you think you are getting consistently screwed by ""shotgun inconsistency"" you're really just missing your shot.

If you want us to do every weekly challenge, that's cool, fun, and fair. If you want us to get a certain number of wins, that's cool, fun, and fair too. If you implement a cool customization we ask for and then stick it behind an arbitrarily high level that you only expect Twitch streamers and other people who can play Fortnite 5 hours a day, five days a week, every week of the season to reach, it feels cool, but not fun or fair.  

If you rework your XP system to reward players who do well (instead of clamping down on kill XP by the 2nd kill, and ignoring it after the 7th), and rework the exponential scaling so that level 62 isn't halfway to level 80, then maybe we can have a challenge like this that's cool, fun, and fair.

Season 2,3 and 4s skin were all males. Dark Knight, Reaper and Omega.
Also apparently season 5's skin may be the Flying Dutch Man.
Maybe for season 6 we can get a female skin.

I feel like there should be a female tier 100 skin because both genders are equal and also many people prefer female skins as they are thinner and smaller.

Or perhaps next seasons can have a female and male tier 100 skin, but honestly that would be unrealistic.

\- on the 9th of july they will activate ingame events like they did it with the comets last season, in the late game will spawn many rifts, which will destroy buildings and part of the maps, if a rift spawns inside you, you can't move or shoot as long as it is there (5-10 seconds depends on the game length) (enemies can't shoot you as well, because the rift's gravity is so strong that bullets will disappear inside of it.

\- typical parts of some places are/will be removed by the rifts (tomato town = tomato head, lonely lodge = the lodge, greasy = durr burger head), because they play a big part on the new map.

\- Tier 200 skin (Look into my other reddit post to know why there are 200 stages) will be a female royale, design will be based on Middle Ages theme.

Infos about skins in season 5: 

\- All new skins will have facial expressions all the time (Like the male robber) - 

Hats of old skins will be extandable (for example dark knight without his hat) and you can put every hat on every single skin (cuddle teamleader hat on dark knight for example)

following skins will never return again:

* all battle pass skins (+ season shop items)
* recon expert
* powerchord
* halloween (+ Ski skins), christmas, eastern skins
* a few more

watch this to see how they will liveupdate the map in season 5 (This is not me, Source: FortNVlog, ask me if you don't want to be shown here)

This is coming from someone who has been playing since day one and has spent over $500 on this game by now. The excuse that this is a free to play game just doesn’t stick anymore. Epic is literally making millions per month with their overpriced skins. People act as if companies that charge $60 then add Micro transactions are greedy ( I agree btw) but the fact is none of them try to charge you $20 for a couple of pixels that in my opinion is the definition of greedy.

When Fortnite first introduced skins they weren’t greedy with it and they encouraged leveling up so you could buy skins, now they make literal copies of the max skin (ex. Oblivion) and just switch the gender so they can change you $20. Another example is the recent “firework team leader” skin which is a literal recolor.

I love fortnite it’s a great game but as time goes on Epic is becoming greedier and greedier with the way they design and price skins with most of them being $20 skins now a days. The it’s a free game excuse is bullshit and we all know this. Stop defending companies and instead help your fellow players so we can change the way they price the skins.

I personally couldn’t care less if they released the skins I bought a while ago, but have a few ideas to try and meet people’s demands in the middle.

1) Have a flash sale with older skins. Instead of one day time allowed, make it an hour. 

2) Make it a requirement to have played in that season, to buy the skin. For example, you had to play during season 2 to buy a season 2 skin.

3) Alter the way the re-released skin looks so that if you originally bought it, yours has the unique aspect to it.",FortNiteBR

I can't aim, or out build no skins. I have the skill of a new player but have been playing for the entire span of the game. These are the reason why I think I suck.

1. In the ye olden days of the very beginning, people didn't build. It was all about the shotgun battles. Shotgun battles were fought 1 way. You would jump and hipfire. Most people know that this is very ineffective, and this was trash, but before a new strat came along, it was muscle memory for me to constantly jump. 

2. I took a break from BR for about a month or two at the end of season 1 due to how badly I sucked, and when I got back on, the new strat was building. This was very new to me, and as most know, building on console was very clunky at this time. It was almost impossible for me to learn, because everyone would dominate me before I could even start to build. Knowing that I didn't even try to build. I went straight to my jump hipfire strat, got destroyed. Season 3 rolls around and I have 1 win due to bush camping. It has been like this since Season 3. I get destroyed and I can't keep up. What are some tips for me? I would really appreciate them.

All images referenced can be found here: [https://imgur.com/a/o9D3smL](https://imgur.com/a/o9D3smL)

Image #1 shows the locations of the cabin and bunker on the map

Images #2 and #3 show photos of the cabin and the bunker

Images #4 and #5 show what the hole in the cabin looks like

Image #6 is where it gets interesting. I measured the distance from the cabin to the bunker in an L shape. From where the hole starts to the edge of the bunker it is exactly 35 floor lengths. I'm not sure if this is a weird coincidence or if it is on purpose. The Bunker Entrance is 3 wall lengths below the cabin hole.

I do not remember if the whole has been in that cabin since the cabin was first put into the map, but even if it was there before, Epic might have decided to base the bunker on it afterwards.

As I have no other proof towards this theory, I'm open for other theories as to what this could be

Sony gets a cut of the money/v-buck transactions that occur on their platform. With that said its time for Sony players to find an alternative way of purchasing and buying items through PSN even if we all still play on their platform. 

With season 5 around the corner, Playstation players should purchase their battle pass on mobile or PC/Mac to keep Sony from getting their cut. In addition it would be good to start making all purchases through another platform until Sony gets off their high horse. Time to hit them where it hurts!

For example, the detective skins. These skins are obviously from the past, along with the Tommy gun that was just added to the game.

A little bracket information if you are interested:

· 146 Slots in the bracket, 160 skins total (14 Alpine Ace and Mogul Master varieties were voted out. Only one of each made it into the actual bracket)

· With the exception of the top 4 seeds, the skins and where they are seeded are completely random and two separate random number generators were used for this process (To try to avoid any bias in the placement).

· Skins will be shown with their seeding and what percent of the votes they received. (ex: *1 Renegade Raider (62\%))* The percentage is how much of the vote they received in that round and the number not in parenthesis is what seed they are in the tournament.

· The top seeds were selected by being the final skin unlocked (level or tier) in each of the 4 seasons. The top seeds are as follows:

o Renegade Raider (last skin from Season 1)

o Black Knight (final tier skin from Season 2)

o The Reaper (final tier skin from Season 3)

o Omega &gt; lvl 80 (final tier skin from season 4, with level 80 requirement met)

This method is best when pushing some at ground level. They have to destroy 3 different buildings before you fall down, and by that time you have probably already shot them.

[Link for the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2ggL2nPUPM) (If you want to get hyped for Season 5, I recommend watching it as well)

I remember when Season 4 came upon us, opening up Fortnite, seeing the cinematic, seeing the new skins in the Battle Pass for the first time, the new main menu background, the hype.

That was wildly fun, telling every single one of my friends to get on the Discord server to discuss Season 4, the excitement was real.

I can say time has definitely flew by, as we are 6 days from Season 5, how crazy is that?

It feels like Season 4 was just 2 weeks ago!

I can't wait for Season 5 literally, I can't wait to get that excitement and hype when opening up Fortnite after the update and seeing the new content again!

Thank you Epic Games for listening to the community and adding what needs to be added and fixing what needs to be fixed, also thank you for the great ""epic"" content you have been releasing throughout Season 4, it has been quite the ride, and safe to say, I'm ready for Season 5!

Yeah this may be the goal of epic, but the tommygun is wayy too overpowered for an uncommon-rare weapon. 
So here’s my three ideas for a way to sort of balance it.

RARITY:
Increase the rarity of the tommygun, they’re too common. I usually find a tommy gun in my game in the first 5 minutes. 
They’re too powerful to be an uncommon, a minigun, a similar weapon, isn’t as good but is more rare than a tommygun

“NERF”:
Obviously I don’t work at epic and I don’t know how balancing really works but these are just suggestions: 
-reduce the damage: without shield a tommygun can kill you in 4 shots at close range, the extremely fast fire rate means you can literally die in under 4 seconds. Reduce the damage so you have 5 shots maybe.
-make it the bloom smaller: at first this doesn’t seem like a nerf, reducing bloom means the weapon is more accurate, right? Well true, but the problem with this weapon is that you don’t need to be accurate because of the bloom, it’s an extremely low skill weapon at close range. You just have to hold the fire button and watch as the other player struggles to survive. No skill needed.

VAULT: 
Honestly this should be last resort, but if stuff like the jet pack and guided missile were vaulted then this should be too.

I know a lot of people here will disagree with me, this subreddit is known for being very toxic. But these are just suggestions. If you disagree, downvote it or maybe give me some actual feedback.
If you’re gonna comment some sh** like “get better at the game scrub xd”, you can go burn in hell.
I feel as though epic is recently just disregarding the older players by creating weapons that make old tactics obsolete. Or just going ahead and nerfing them. 
appealing to the newer players should be an objective, ok, but don’t leave the older players who made your game what it is now in the dust.

Platform: PC (decent XBOX/PS4/Switch cross-platform players are welcome too)

Region: EUW (if you are from another region but don’t mind playing on EUW feel free to join)

Hello /fortniteBR,

I’m Supotco and I’m founding a clan. I often end up adding people who don’t take the game too seriously and just see it as a challenge to rush every enemy and get the kill. With some I play on the regular and we thought: lets form a clan of like-minded-non-try-hard-decent-players. That way there will always be other nice clan mates online to squad up with.

I present to you: PLUS ULTRA

In PLUS ULTRA we like to switch things up. One game we jump tilted and try to kill all the other squads while keeping the squad alive. The next game we jump a bit further for a normal paced game and steadily hunt for other squads while working ourselves to the win. Also, I cannot resist a shopping cart when I see one.

If you would like to join PLUS ULTRA it would be nice if the following points sound like you in order of importance:

1. You play for fun and to improve, not to win. You enjoy playing whether you win or lose.

2. You never flame or act salty

3. You prefer getting nice/fun kills, hunting enemies and getting better over playing passively to win

4. You try to work together with teammates

5. You know all the basics of the game

6. You play fast (it’s alright if you are an average player and can’t loot that fast but if your team moves to the next place so should you)

7. You are an average player (decent/average aim, be able to build to get around, basic protective building, basic ramp pushing)

8. You don’t mind if clan mates prefer playing with someone else who is better or gives a greater XP boost to other clan mates (since we will all be pushing for the level 80 Omega reward this season and any other tier 100 rewards the next) 

Just add and message me or one of the executive leaders in-game if you would like to run a few rounds with us.

GO BEYOND, GO PLUS ULTRA!

TL;DR: PLUS ULTRA is looking for at least average players who play for fun, message Supotco",FortNiteBR

There is nothing more fair than having same skill lvl opponents \*(I know people can create accounts and play with lower div players like smurfing but that's minority and can be countered on how exactly a player can increase his rank , like lp points gain per game upon different factors etc )\*

 Everyone who says ranking system will make people toxic like in league (i think  ninjas said in a vod ive watched yesterday something like this )  dont realize that league is a team game  where you can't just roll over anyone only with your own skill in every game unless u worth at least two divs up from your current lvl and your champ on the specific situation allows it. \*(Not to mention the  incredible amount of trollers-boosted or people who don't worth their rank for whatever reason and how flawed  a lot of their systems are)\*

 I know good players or people with a lot of experience on the game might not like ranking system cause games in higher divs would get bit boring for your average  player(especially younger people which is the majority of fortnite audience) since they won't have 20kills every game  (with ten of them being bots or new players) unless they are really good or have a very good game. But for the casual player that wants to have a bit of fun in fair lvl environment with not really the desire to burn himself with tons of hours with solely purpose to improve is perfect. 

 Ps. Plus in my opinion ranking system would add nice flavor to the competitive side of the game since getting a lot of kills for better players would actually mean something instead of sometimes being pure luck as to how many ""bots"" or newbies people encountered in their way. Also it would create a nice rewarding system with a nice progression aspect instead of just being a clownfiesta jumping trying to get a lot of kills or win and then repeat.

I seriously think that over 530 000 experience is way to much for a casual player. And I hope that Season 5 will lower it to more reasonable amount.


When I was leveling up my account I've noticed that at full 100tier account you gets roughly about 1000 experience per 20 minutes on a good game. This pretty quickly adds up to about 180 hours assuming that you have tier 100 from the start. That's 18 hours per week, around 2.5hrs per day every day.


Not everyone has this amount of time available considering that some people work for the living, some study and have exams, and some doesn't want to play the same game 2.5hrs a day every single day.


Now, I do understand that this is supposed to be a challenge, sense of accomplishment and things like that, but this doesn't even feel like a challenge, but a grind fest. As someone who completed all 9 weeks of challenges (about to start week 10 tomorrow) I just feel emptiness and disappointment knowing that after I did everything the game has to offer I still need to grind insane amount of hours for those bloody omega Christmas lights.


Playing the game to level up feels like a MMORPG where you kill the same boss over and over again, rather than a fast paced battle royale game. We all know that the best way to get top 10 for an average player is afk in the bush, which is literally the opposite of what an interactive gameplay looks like.

I have a simple solution which i inspired from LoL (League of Legends)

there  was a similar outcry if any of you played league and remembered the  ''Championship Riven'' skin, what RIOT (Game company) did to combat this  was release the Championship riven for everyone that wanted to buy it  BUT the players that originally had it, got something special for owning  the Original skin, in LoL for example you had rivens sword that glows  when her Ultimate was used. something that didnt happen with the new  re-released Riven...

This problem adressed both category of players, the players that wanted to get the skin could now get it as they wished...

and  the players that had owned it for years before hand had special borders  in the in game laoding screen when they already had the skin and had a  ''tweaked cosmetic visual enhance'' of said skin , brighter and more  refined skin and the glowing the sword...

If a player has two or more pump shotguns, they can instantly shoot, swap, and shoot again.  This effectively doubles the rate of fire to an already powerful weapon.  That seems a bit too powerful to be left alone (considering the majority use this combination and are greatly effective with it).

If you ask me, the solution to this fast pump shotgun swap should be as follows.  **When a pump shotgun is fired, you cannot switch to anything else (building or to another weapon slot) until the weapon has finished its pump cycle.**  In other words, between when the shot is fired until the end of a pump, that's the period where you can't swap to something else (aka a cool-down period).  I figure **this will restore the risk/reward factor of the weapon** and remove its ability to be exploited via the fast swap.

I know I might get hate because people utilize this combo.  I understand winning is important and this might be the best way for people to do so (via the pump swap).  Some will even suggest I forget about wanting to patch the fast swap because I should ""get good and use it myself.""  However, for the sake of overall balance, I feel this should be addressed as soon as possible.  What are your opinions?",FortNiteBR

So I can’t sleep and basically started wondering what made the Skull Trooper skin so rare. The obvious answer is that it hasn’t been released again since October so of course that’s going to make it rare. 

However.. i began to wonder if the rise of Myth (Who’s widely known to wear this skin to even the most common player) helped make the skull trooper so popular? 

For you season 1 &amp; 2 veterans, what was the common perception of the skin at the time? Did many love it or hate it? And do you see the impact of Myth’s rise to popularity and stardom contribute to the skin’s popularity and rareness? Or is the skin just that cool and rare that it would’ve been popular regardless if Myth choose this skin to be his or not.

Please share thoughts below, as I have work in a few hours and I can’t sleep and would like to discuss with you all.

P.S if you ever read this Myth ily and I’m a huge fan. ",FortNiteBR

I fall in the middle for the argument as a whole, but this point is just flat out wrong. When the players bought the Red Knight, they didn't buy it because it was rare. Since it was the first time coming out, presumably everyone at the time would have been buying it! It was not rare when they bought it, so there's no way that could be their reasoning behind the purchase.

The people clamouring for older skins like Skull Trooper however... (And as it's legitimately a much better skin, Red Knight to a much lower degree...) are the real ones who mainly want the skin cause it's rare. If we're looking objectively, the Skull Trooper is a garbage skin. It's a boring, plain, Halloween costume. It's only benefit is being rare, and should never come back.

Again I will say that objectively the Red Knight skin looks much nicer, so I understand that argument there. However the basis for that point as a whole can come off quite hypocritical in some cases.",FortNiteBR

He also makes very questionable and almost dumb decisions at times, and that is mirrored by the teammates he plays with! This is all subjective..

So, after lots of research I have observed that any object you break during a game will be back in the next game. For exemple, you go to, lets say tilted, and destroy a car, then you quit the game and enter a new one, you will see that the car you broke is back. However, everything destroyed by the purple stuff is gone forever. Having this information I made the perfect plan to rescue the Burger Boi:

Some minutes before the rift is created and supposedly kills the Burger Boi (This should hapend at around 15:00 EST tomorrow), everyone enters a random game and kills him (I know this will be very emotional, but it has to happend), then you wait until the rift appears, quit the game and join a new one. You will see that the rift will not have consumed the Burger Boi and he will be completely safe.

Epic values its players, but it values its image more and that's just a fact, a company will have no fans if people are being consistantly scammed which for a while is going to occur with gifting, so epic is going to make things only have value based corely on their look, not how old they are, (except battle pass skins, which I'd assume you won't be able to gift) so in dropping added value to skins, epic decreases the odds of scams happening with that skin.

1: Realize people enjoy other things

I get that you like Fortnite and want people to know that, that doesn’t mean to argue at other people just because they prefer Splatoon or Spyro

2: Not every Battle Royale is a copy of Fortnite 


If you’re going to scream about this stuff, admit Fortnite took inspiration from PUBG 


3: Just because someone liked a feature that was removed and you didn’t like it doesn’t mean that you should argue about it

I personally liked the Jetpack, so when I said I would like it back I didn’t expect to have someone tell me to “Piss off” (This actually happened)


4: If a player is bad, don’t criticize them for it

Just because a player is bad doesn’t mean he isn’t helpful. He may not have as much playtime or practice as you, that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t play

5: DON’T KILL TEAMMATES 

This should stop being as much as a problem now that 50 v 50, 20 v 20 v 20 v 20, and Final Fight  are gone, but don’t try and kill teammates to get gear

6: Don’t tell people to “KYS” 


With a system like voice chat in a primarily team based game as well as a strong social media presence, this happens way more commonly than most would think. Mostly it’s just 10 year olds trying to sound “edgy” and “cool” but please report these people.

The building before was ok, but it was still incredibly boring waiting around just to get mats. It would take a quarter of the game just to get max mats. Recently they’re ruining it even more with a 20 mat spawn and llamas only giving 600 mats. They also made it so you can’t see through your editing, Which I don’t like because it gets rid of an entire aspect of “build battle.” 

Please leave your thoughts below and hopefully epic will change the building.",FortNiteBR

I have never really been into this type of games, hell the only game I remember playing, that is close to this type of games was Halo, back in my high school days, almost 10 years ago, because it was popular at my school lol.

I have played mostly games on my iPad, since I never really felt the need to get a laptop or a PS4 (I do have a PS3, somewhere). I have played some MOBAS like Vainglory, some card games like hearthstone and sports games.

Recently my sister got me into Fortnite, she wanted help to get good to play with her friends at school, and oh man have I become addicted to this.

I now find myself constantly playing Fortnite, even though I am still very noobish. I have played PUBG on mobile as well and I was shocked to how easy PUBG was when compared to Fortnite. I guess it’s because of the building aspect of Fortnite, but even then PUBG is so much easier. 

Does anyone have any tips to mobile users that could help me improve? I play on my IPhone SE for now, while my IPad is repairing, so any tips from users that play in a SE, would be gladly appreciated.

I'm curious who you guys think is the best player for each weapon in the game though. I've watched far too many highlights on youtube so I think I can give a decent opinion, but obviously there are plenty of great players who I've seen sparingly or not at all. With that being said...

Automatic AR - Tfue

Burst AR - Kraftyy/Hamlinz

Scoped AR - Tfue/HD

Shotguns - Daequan

LMG - Ninja

SMGs - ???

Snipers - Dakotaz/Hamlinz

Hunting Rifle - Ninja/Tfue

Grenade Launcher - Tfue/Ninja

Rocket Launcher - ???

Pistols - ???

Obviously this is all highly subjective but just wanted to see what you guys think or if you can fill in the blanks with some good gameplay of pistols/rocket launchers.",FortNiteBR

[MAJOR]

• Landing at popular locations (read: Tilted Towers) is literally impossible because the buildings don’t render in, leaving you with low-poly blurred buildings that you can’t enter.

• Most of the time, upon picking up your first item of the game, the game will freeze for about 5 seconds, which is devastating in combat situations.

• Occasionally (I’ve only encountered this glitch twice) players will be invisible aside from their held item. Both of the times it lead to me being eliminated.

• Very severe frame drops in populated places. 50v50 is very difficult to play at times, as I’m getting spikes of &gt;10fps.

• Gyroscope controls are kind of a hot mess right now. There are quite a few videos on YouTube that explain the issues better than I can

[LESS IMPORTANT]

• Going over a bouncer in an ATK can produce some really weird effects. The particles become huge and fill the screen, which actually hurts my eyes sometimes when it happens.

• Sometimes the textures will just decide to have a day off, and you’ll be left with either extremely low-res textures on everything or just block colours.

• Your held item for some reason sometimes carries over into emotes and other animations (like gliding), which is pretty funny, but is also a bug.

I hope I flaired this post right. I’m pretty sure that the XBOX version of the game is also experiencing some issues at the moment, and it just seems to be getting worse each update.
Even though I have been complaining here, thank you for all your hard work Epic :)",FortNiteBR

I believe we could have a LTM where kills are also awarded by simply giving you an amount of shield proportional to the HP + Shield you opponent had, maybe 1/5 of it or something like that.

At least it happens to me from time to time, that after getting a lot of kills in a short time, I get hit quite a bit (in the current meta it's very hard to not get hit even when it's an easy kill) and neither me or my kills happen to have shield. So all I did is make the game easier for the people that's still alive because without health or shield it's really hard that I can't win even if I took the bests players in the match out. This LTM would fix that because after each kill you'd get some shield.

It'll also help with the RNG at the start of a match where you may not find any shield in 3 chests but the rest of the guys that landed there do find shield. So maybe you'll kill 3-4 of them just to get one mini, and you'll be left with 25 shield and 40 hp. Not worth it at all and in my opinion, not fair.

Could probably be a solution to that third party that comes with 100 hp + 100 shield after you've got 4 kills in the same spot and are left with very little hp, just to get a very easy kill on you and take all the loot. Even when your kills have shield, this third party most of the times just comes at the most inconvenient time so you can't heal and we all know that turtling to heal is not an option anymore (which I find good and bad at the same time)

I'd love this in the normal game mode but I get some of you may prefer a more tactical aproach to the game where you pick your fights carefully and avoid direct fights if you are low on hp. I feel what makes this game entertaining to me is playing agressive, and seeing that Epic is encouraging this at a competitive level, it would be awesome that it is encouraged in public modes too, so that's why I think it could interesting to see something like this in a LTM.

PD: sorry for my horrible english, it reads like an essay from an 8 yeard old lol.",FortNiteBR

So let me list our problems with this game to make it easier. **TL:DR at the bottom.**

1. Morphing through peoples shit is still a problem, and it's been in the game since the begging. You can easily morph by just holding W while spamming your SMG/Drum gun and morph through the dudes wall, super annoying.

2. Traps are broken this update, do literally no damage most of the time.

3. The meta is absolute ***shit*** it has made nobody good at the game, and is bad game design. Have you ever out built the fuck out of a no-skin and he just sprays you the fuck down? Yeah, that's annoying as fuck. SMGs/Drum Guns are fucking horrible. Did you miss all of your 5/8 shotgun bullets because you can't aim for shit? Well take out your fucking drum gun with 50 bullets and spam the fuck out of that kid. The new SMGs are making me hate this game so fucking much and I just end up stop playing. It's not fun to fight against at all. And don't *fucking* tell me l̵͍̔͆e̴̳̊̆a̸̩̾r̷͕̦̈́n̵̯̚ ̶̢̜͛ț̷̩̇̈́ó̷͔̀ ̷͙̽̽a̵̺̐i̴̡̬̾͛m̵̪̐ ̴̝̑l̴̟̕o̶͈̬̍̈́l̵̦̼̈̇ or to ""c̶̫̄o̴̧̠̎u̵̧̘͆n̸̦̯̂̓t̷͔͐͝ḛ̸̀̈r̸̞̔"" them. They just hold down that M1 button and 56 HS me or 36 hs me,
                                                                                
4. Hey Epic, what the fuck happened to shooting tests? Bloom is still a fucking problem in this game. Ever have your crosshair right on the guy and missed every bullet? That is called bloom. Most annoying thing in any game, removes the skill from shooting/aiming.

5. Shotguns still suck ass, why do we still have the **fucking** delay on the pump? And it seems their is still a random pattern on shotguns, mostly the heavy. Such as it shows every pellet on the reticle but does 17 on a headshot.

6. **Leave building, the fuck alone.** Do not cater to new players, at fucking all. We all started off as dumb no brained idiots, but we learned. Watch how we transferred from Season 1 to 3. In Season 1, 85% had no fucking idea you could build in this game, in Season 2 building started becoming not as rare, and in Season 3 building became simple knowledge and it still is. Epic, do not fuck with building, unless it's to fix bugs. 

7. What in the ***absolute*** fuck did you guys do the the RPG? This may be a old subject, but still, what the fuck. RPG was completely fine before and adding to the splash damage to buildings was fucking stupid. The Grenade launcher was made to do that, not a fucking straight no skill projectile. (RPG actually does take some skill to predict but put it in a no-skins hand and it's Hell.)

P.S. make your servers better lol

This is the info I received:

1. You do NOT need to pre-order either device to be eligible for the skin promotion.

2. Once you have either device, you must register it on the Samsung shop app (possibly on the website too, not sure on this one)

3. The registration steps and purchase criteria will be updated ""soon"" here: https://samsungpromotions.com/

4. The registration for the promotion starts on 8/20/18 and ends 9/13/18 (or possibly 12/31/18, the rep was a tad bit unclear here).

5. The promotion doesn't actually start until 8/24/18, so although you can register it on 8/20/18 you won't receive the rewards until the 24th.

6. You CAN get the Galaxy skin on multiple fortnite accounts on the same device.


Now, these are a lot of claims, and honestly I cant say 100% if this rep knows exactly what he's talking about, but he seemed knowledgeable on the subject. At the very least it cleared a couple things up for me, the main thing being that we don't have to actually preorder anything, so buying the cheaper option (Galaxy Tab s4) is still an option even though it's already available.

Let me know what you guys think, and if none of this is new information to you then by all means ignore me lol.

Having the ability to create cover from thin air does NOT belong in a shooting game. PERIOD!  


Think of your favorite shooting game. Remember of all of those nice kills you earned because you knew the map and found clever ways to use your environment to your advantage? Now, imagine if those games got an update and has  included a new gameplay mechanic that allows your opponents to find materials and create literal walls between you and your bullets! You give the new game a try and you encounter an opponent. You use your great skills of aim, crouching and using cover. You land a few very damaging hits on the target but right before you can deal the final blow, your opponent builds a wall. Then stairs..Then a floor...Then he is right over top of you......He jumps down and shotguns you.......This is what life in Fortnite is like. It's is crappy mechanic.   


Now I know, some of you will say ""Get good"" but let's be honest here, it's not that simple. Shooting games demand certain skills that are pretty universal in shooters. Maintain good aim, find cover, make use of your environment, things like that. But no shooter has ever made it possible to build cover right in front of you and not only that, but have cover before the cover is actually built!! How often have I gotten into fights and almost killed my opponent only to have him keep regenerating his wall or building a stairway to heaven to gain the height advantage? It's a freakin' cheat! It's like we were given access to the debugging mode and can now just generate assets for testing! NO shooter should allow this! No first person or third person shooter. The only thing you need to ""get good"" at in this game is bunny hoping around (constantly jumping and shooting) and building walls fast. I don't like it at all!  


Some of you may love this function so I will make it clear that it is not in my intention to insult you, but come on now. Heck, I wouldn't even mind a compromise. Make building slower! Or at least make it so that the walls being built are ineffective until they are finished. It makes no sense that when I am firing on an opponent, that I cannot hit him/her through the openings of a unfinished wall. There shouldn't be a holographic blockade for the unfinished wall! I should be able to shoot right through empty spaces with no resistance. Make the point of building forts truly tactical instead some quick-twitch reaction to gunfire.   


Okay...I'm done now.

Lately it seems as if people are more focused on killing foes who’ve been knocked than they are continuing battles with the team members who are still alive. Epic should seriously consider a 60 second “immortal” period when players are knocked so that the game becomes more about the squad battles than thirsting for an elimination. This would create more interesting end game battles instead of having squad games end with 1 v 1 v 2 v 4 as the circle comes to a close. It also would take more skill to win as it would create a necessity to wipe out an entire team during each battle. I’m tired of knocking someone, continuing to battle instead of immediately eliminating them, only to get knocked and then be immediately killed. My teammates then focus more on revenge killing, as opposed to winning a battle. I do the same when my teammates are thirsted, my only goal then is to eliminate the guy who thirsted them. It’s ruining gameplay. Please consider a period of time where knocked players can’t be killed so that gameplay gets back to squad battles instead of strictly eliminations.

If either:
1. V-bucks were cheaper or;
2. The things you bought with v-bucks were cheaper
We would all have put significantly more money into the game.
I understand that people are willing to pay so the devs probably don't care that much but just imagine if for example a nice skin was 1000 instead of 1400 v-bucks, I as well as others would happily spend money on getting 2 skins for 2000 but I wouldn't spend 1400 on 1 skin. You may have dropped the value and others may have spent 1400 on that one skin but the sheer amount of people who would buy at least one skin for 1000 would surely offset that 400 difference.
The only way this breaks down is if this is an intentional ploy on epics behalf to create skin exclusivity however considering they're a business who makes nearly all their profit from skins/emotes etc, exclusivity seems to be a bit of a moot point.
I urge epic to potentially reconsider their pricing structure not because I and others can't afford it but simply so that those of us who can't justify spending upwards of AU$20 on a skin and an emote can feel like they're getting a rational amount if they were to spend $20 on two skins and an emote.

Now im not saying put these items in the item shop. Season 7 will be the anniversary of season 2. So I got to thinking. what if in season 7, players who bought the season 2 battlepass get a second chance to grind it out. me personally I got to tier 67 in the battlepass. Now it would work like THIS. You would have two battle passes on and, say if you complete a daily challenge that gives you 5 battlestars your season 7 battlepass and season 2 battlepass would get 5 battlestars. or you could choose witch battlepass to give them too. this could be implemented into the other season anniversary's as well. But say if its season 7 anniversary. you would have the season 7 battlepass, and the season 12 battlepass at this point the s2 battlepass skins will be unobtainable.. for all of the people sayin ""you just have to work for it"" I have a job, and a life and I got to tier 67.... and the skins would still be rare. And also with ragnorak and Drift there letting people still upgrade the skins. so technically season 5 battlepass skins are unlockable after the season ends. I want to hear constructive criticism in the comments, of how I could change around this idea. well, since im to lazy to edit this back in the only way you could grind this out again is by buying that battepass in its respectable season. so basically no second chances to buy the battlepasses.",FortNiteBR

I would consider myself decent with the controller and pretty good with mouse and keyboard.

I love the fact that you are able to play fortnite with mouse and keyboard on consoles since it runs so good on them, but after these days I kinda saw this problem. A lot of players are legit godlike with their controllers and I respect that so much, but I was killed sooo many times by people who obviously used mouse and keyboard on console. It felt a bit unfair to be honest.

Shouldn’t you get matched with people on PC when the game detects mouse and keyboard? It clearly has its advantages over using a controller no matter how good you are with it. You get precision aim while still having the ability to look around very fast, you can jump while looking around without having to use some weird grip on a controller, extra keys to have more control and less clunky gameplay etc.

It just seems unfair to the people using controllers, especially the ones that aren’t godlike with it. ",FortNiteBR

Also, there's any of new content cause these weapons and small POI changes doesn't count, I'm sure we got used to it. New LTMs are rare nowadays, people in EU (the server of mine) are all too toxic and not fun to play with, even in solos they can't give you a minute to dancem they will ADS their scar and go straight to you while shooting. Again, this game doesn't rewards you for just playing it, there's no progression system, no matchmaking. Grinding for stats in FNtracker is just silly IMO. So yeah, my question is: how are you, players with 100+ wins are having fun in this game?

I think this will lead to a few benefits:

* Squads will stay complete more often. Being killed early and having to spectate through the rest of the match will happen less.
* New strategies will evolve around trapping downed players to use as bait. Just imagine the bouncepad shenanigans.
* Squads will be forced into more all-or-nothing encounters. Instead of squadmates feeling free to disengage when a squadmate dies early (or the other squad killing their hostage early to give themselves breathing room) all squads will stay in tense situations longer.
* 1v4 comebacks in which one squadmate rescues his entire team will happen more often.

the first problem that everyone had in mind talking about 50v50 is that people used to push you or take down your ramps , or your team mates will fall very far away from the circle and everyone would die in the storm.... 

Well soaring 50s fixed both of these problems ... i have never been so happy to see 12 dudes jumping off a cliff to glide head first to the enemy.... This is the most fun i had on fortnite in a long time.

 You should try it even if you dont get revived its still a fun experience. Sometimes its nice to just dont try and just do whatever.

Idk why, but there's something that's pissing me off somewhat when it comes to this.

It just feels downright embarssing when you screw up your stats because of being a bad player at the start and then once you finally get good you have way less kills than games so it's almost impossible to raise that to being higher than games played. Unless your willing to go to tilted or some other commonly populated area to start raising your kills (which then, unless you're ninja or myth, is just you trying to sacrifice your win% to get a lot of kills in order to get a positive K/D ratio). 

It's probably too late for me to start trying to get more kills than games played (on PS4 at least, on pc I already have more kills than games played, still very little). 

For those that also have way less kills than games played, how do you feel about that? Do you feel pissed off, embarrassed, or do you not really care much about it? Have you tried to get more kills than games played?",FortNiteBR

An option to use previous battlepasses, through buying special battlepass tickets.  


Once the ticket used to have access to previously purchased battlepasses, all your active battlepasses will be disabled until the ticket expires, this ticket will make previously bought battlepasses active again, and will allow players who didnt have much time to do them, or couldnt due to hardware limitations be able to get these items that could only be gotten by other players who stuck around then.  


Another way to balance this out, is to make the ticket a subscription, each month or week the user would have to pay a fee to gain access to the previously purchased battlepasses and get their rewards, and by previously purchased, I mean someone that only bought the season 5 battlepass wont have access to the older ones, unless they bought them when they were out.

I've tried Fortnite first in Season 2 but I was really bad (literally first time playing it) so I lost interest.

Then I gave it second chance in mid Season 3. I fell in love. I loved the new and exciting mechanics (building especially), I loved battlepass skins (first time, I've spent money on Fortnite). Then meteor showed up on the sky. Hype was unreal, me and my friends were playing the game all time and we were really enjoying it, ignoring the fact we were gettinng almost no wins. We have even purchased Overwatch recently, but we were rather playing this awesome F2P, no P2W game.

Then Season 4 came out. The battlepass rewards were terrible. Hype fell down. Double pump came back (I will talk about this later). Also I have weaker PC, so I experienced annoying performace drop. Only thing I can remember in Season 4 and feel excited is rocket launch and story telling.

Now Season 5 is here. Hype for the new season was almost none, shotguns getting nerfed to the ground, lots but LOTS of new bugs. The spray n' pray meta. 

I am not enjoying game this much anymore, my friends aren't enjoying the game anymore too.

What's the problem with new Fortnite? Honestly I don't know exactly.
But this is not game, I've fallen in love anymore. If you ask me, what Epic did wrong, I would say that I don't even mind the bugs (since they are getting fixed pretty quickly actually), but they shouldn've do so many drastical changes.

So I want to ask YOU, why don't you enjoy Fortnite anymore? Or do you actually enjoy it more? Why? 

(and for the double pump: at first I hated it so much. then I started to learn it and guess what, it wass actually pretty fun to use. so getting rid of it kinda got me upset)

It's changed so much negatively in my opinion and it's not fun anymore for me or any of my friends. They all basically quit and only play sometimes when I beg them to squad up. I'm on the verge of quitting as well, even though I have loved Fortnite since I started playing in Season 2. 

This new meta isn't really adaptable as I know everyone is going to try to say, there's no skill involved anymore since instead of building with someone they just spray you down, and the building was what made the game fun for me. I spend months and months grinding and learning to get better and better at building, just for it to become almost useless now in Season 5.

 I do still love Fortnite, at least for what it used to be, it's just I don't have fun anymore playing this game. I really can't believe you if you have played as long as I have and say you still love it exactly the same. There's so many gamebreaking bugs, for example traps not even working. Or players going through your builds, yea that's still a thing even though they said they fixed it.

We all thought it was coming and we were almost positive. There were even the signs on the top of the apartment building and the TVs and the coordinates all seemed to be showing that tilted was going to be hit with a meteor. However, the meteor missed and hit dusty depot and it had all of these hop rocks that werent from the original fortnite map. The visitor popped out of the meteor as well. Before the visitor ""went home"" there was a laser pointed straight for tilted as if it was going to be destroyed. Everyone seems to say that the ship was too powerful and it wouldve been accidental. But what if the visitor tried to destroy tilted with the meteor and make it look like an accident and it failed? I\`m just saying that the visitor had advanced technology and equipment and he used hop rocks to control where the meteor was going and he missed. Afterwards, he tried to make another attempt while in the ship but it didnt work. Now that the visitor is gone what if he\`s sending someone else for another attack on tilted and that\`s what the season 5 week 7 skin will be. It\`s all just a theory but if you think of the visitor as a bad guy it makes sense.",FortNiteBR

I think it's still because of the spam meta and how my building feels so useless. Yes I understand they nerfed smg's and the drum bun but it barely suppressed the issue. Explosives aren't able to be countered with building. Every time I jump into a game I lose end game to the same exact thing every time. Which is getting spammed by a gun with a 40+ bullet magazine size, Or getting straight barraged with explosions I can't counter. My aspirations to get better at the game have decreased immensely and I went from solo squading to solo's to logging in for 3 hours a week. If none of my friends played the game I feel like I would've quit by now. This post isn't to degrade the game but they've taken out all variety and everyone just spams still. It's obviously been alleviated but it's still META. Whenever I fight a good player they do the same thing. Shotgun - drum gun me until I'm either 1 shot or I have high ground.

The only thing epic has not given us, it's skins. But here I propose an idea! 3 actually...

1) After 10 solo wins, certain rare skins are unlocked.

Or

2) After 10 solo wins, you earn 100 ***OR LESS*** vbucks. (Keep in mind this is just an idea please mn be gentle)

Or

3) After 10/20 solo wins, you are granted the option to select which defaulty boi you would play as.

Season 2: I go into a game, I decide to just jump out randomly and I get sniped by a pump, welcome to early fortnite

I go into another match, I land at a building in the center factory now part of Dusty Divot (RIP OG FACTORY)

I put a launch pad into a spike trap and that is how I get my 4th kill (I had a really good 2nd match)

Then I grind out the rest of the day and do not remember my matches, but I do remember that 2nd match I came very close to winning

and the main problem of the game imo at the time was that the player with more shields would win 

SEASON 3 MID: So I came in about a week or two before tilted towers was added, so I didn't care and I used mostly the pump and I started my early on mouse binds, and built slightly above average for people that attempted to build.

Then this was the first time I realized how big of a problem bloom was in Tilted towers fights, because sniping with a ar was just hoping your shots would not bounce over the place. And I died in a fight and I had my reticle on his head the whole time, and I realized how big of an issue this was

LATE SEASON 3: So this was a well known part of the game where people were really starting to consistently knowing how to build, I believe around now mini shields and Blitz came out, both were a godsend to the game because it made luck based shielding a lot less common as well as blitz making games faster and winning better

EARLY SEASON 4:

PROBLEMS: 

1: Double pump was op

2: Blitz 2.0 reduced farming which basically ruined the mode

3: with building being a more common thing people could just camp in a building and spam rockets, so a good player will eventually run out of materials

4: Bloom is worse of a problem then ever

5: I was really a noob in early season 4 and it was my first time really having problems with people attempting to camp for a unfair win in #2 making the game all about hiding and peeking to a better player, not that winning is a bad thing for skill, but its too easy to win as a noob

SEASON 5:

Okay so double pumping was removed, but with a gun now doing half its dps, what do they do? Nothing

The second best close quarters weapon are SMG's and 3 different smgs get added, so finding a smg is so easy to do now

PROBLEMS:

1: SMGs have taken over shotguns, and that isn't the huge issue. The huge issue is, SMG fights are a total coinflip, 

Proof of this? Watch Ged's video on the SMG meta and he fired first on his teamate in playground and prepared by aiming for the head, and he won a little more then half his fights to RNG (When he fired first)

2: Now materials are a little bit harder to get early on as material spawns have decreased.

3: Player splits are more screwed as now Paradise is pulling in everyone

4: Now the Sawed off shotgun can do over 100 to the foot

NOW FINALLY, What will fix the game

1: Give guns recoil patterns! Look before I get my pc covered in rotten tomatoes, it doesn't have to be CSGO, Make recoil pattern like this. 1-2 shots accurate, 1 shot a bit up, then the rest of the shots so inaccurate nobody can control it, except for guns like the scar. make it 3-4 accurate 2 shot a bit up and the rest innaccurate uncontrollably,

What will this do?

1: Prevent lasering

2: Prevent unfair deaths to lucky players

3: Increase methods to win (What epic wanted to do)

FIX 2: Increase the pumps base damage from 80 to 90 and 90 to 95, and increase the fire rate like 1/6 of what it was

What will this do?

1: Get rid of unfair ttk with double pump (Already is gone)

2: Increase strategies

3: Actually make the gun able to fight against SMG's

FIX 3: Increase material spawns from 20 to 40

What will this do?

1: Make early game fights more skill based then luck based

2: Make skilled players want to go to dangerous locations more because of 1

3: Make the game more fast paced as people don't have to farm as much

FIX 4: Increase material gathering by 25%-33%

What will this do

1: Further reduce farm times

2: I really hope 1 makes it obvious, but farming takes too long, and I've been losing and winning early games because me or my enemy run out of resources and not to actual skill

FIX 5: Increase wood by 20ish HP

What will this do

1: Encourage the height advantage and not the laser down structure advantage

Also I think it shouldn't be 200, its a bit too much and you should use metal and brick for long term building and you should be punished for wood if you try to make big buildings out of it

FIX 6: Make some guns airdrop/Vending machine only, and reduce vending machine count 

What will this do

1: Maybe a sniper that does 150 damage can't be picked up by someone lucky,

How should this fix be applied?

A: Make all gold guns supply drop only as well as the heavy sniper rpg and grenade launcher

B: Do A, but make them vending machine only, and make vending machine spawns less common, but in a few areas guaranteed

2: Will prevent dying unfair early game to someone lucky because they can click once and a projectile that doesn't land near you kill you, 

3: It will encourage people going to air drops, which will artificially cause fights, could you imagine playing squads, and your team and another are inten

FIX 6: MAP REWORK

Changes I want in depth?

1: Better player split

2: Good loot all around

What do I think could fix this?

IMO go all out, Make Pleasant park have more farmable materials as well as tilted, increase the rift size and make them more like full on teleporters, and make Tilted, Paradise, and Pleasant the biggest action makers, and make sure classic fans of all 3 locations like the rework. (Obviously this wont happen, but if they were to that'd be a solid option imo)

Fortnite has lost it's fun because of the lack of a reward system in this game. Sure, you get rewarded for doing challenges but nowhere does it say that you get rewarded for winning. The appeal of winning a game has really worn off after playing this game since Season 1, especially considering the fact that if I want to TRULY get competitive, I'd have to wait for a REAL competitive mode to come out, as Solo Showdown is a joke of a competitive mode.

The developers also think that adding new weapons and modes every week will keep the player base engaged but it's just not working. (This also ties in with there being no rewards for winning). I'll tell you this much, it hasn't worked for me, and hasn't for a long time. It worked maybe the first time a new weapon came out but after that, it went downhill.

I have been a HUGE fan of Fortnite ever since the first week it came out, and I just really hate to see the game lose my interest. I think adding a true competitive mode and adding rewards for winning would be HUGE for this game.


TL;DR: Fortnites getting old, they need true comp and rewards for winning

Idea: I’ve seen the post about building being delayed where players fall through their own building. My idea is if that was the normal. Building is still there but there is a delay between when you build and when it can be used. 

Reasoning: This would cause the game to be more strategic, a game styled around more tactical shooting and involving more direct fire fights. Players would still be able to use building to defend against attack or to use to gain a vantage point on an enemy, without the thought of turning around and facing against the pentagon itself. As a game designer myself, this is a vision I have had for fortnite’s future, especially after all the new weapon metas. I do not see the game evolving and staying as a “just build lol” meta. I see it evolving into a game of powerful weapons, tactical building, and strategic firefights based on accuracy and using your surroundings.

This may be just me... but I feel some out there have to agree with me. If anything I really hope there could be a game mode that incorporates something of this nature to allow more tactical gameplay instead of building. ",FortNiteBR

The game is getting stale. Even the bad players who have been around for a while have plenty of wins. Winning means nothing anymore to many people. Remember back in the day when you'd see videos of people freaking out over winning? That doesn't happen much anymore. There's no incentive to keep playing the game. There's nothing to grind for other than the Battle Pass which has been the same thing over and over (and you can earn XP towards skin upgrades at any time so nobody cares to grind all season for that). Nobody cares about their level because it goes away once the season ends. 

Why don't they have a huge set of permanent challenges (like in Save the World)? 

Why don't they have a leveling system with prestiges that doesn't just get wiped every season? 

Why don't they make challenges that require wins over time to earn something? 

Why don't they add an arcade with many LTMs that cycle in and out so we don't get bored of the same thing over and over?

There were map changes every single week season 3. I feel like it has been really stale gameplay on everything but guns. What’s your thoughts? ,FortNiteBR

I understand they are doing this for marketing, but seriously, if you bought an S9 you aren't gonna go buy a Note 9 a couple months afterwards, unless you are really dedicated to Samsung phones, but then you would probably buy it anyways. Also, if they give it to the S9, I'm sure there are some people that are on the edge between an Apple device or Samsung device that don't want to pre-order a phone and can't decide between the two, seeing that there is an awesome skin if they buy the S9 instead of the iPhone whatever, that might be enough to push them to buy the S9.

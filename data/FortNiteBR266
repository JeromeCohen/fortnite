A few months ago we had grenade launchers, grenades, RPG's and AR's to take down builds. Now we have all those plus the mini-gun, the LMG, sticky grenades, C4,  Tommy gun, the new MP5 and the P90 just around the corner. 

I understand Epic may feel for one reason or another they needed to nerf the building META in the game but it's getting worse and worse. In solos it's not so bad  but when you're down on numbers in squads it's killing decent players chances. Superior players always stood a chance against 2/3 sometimes 4 potatoes now unless you're a really high skilled player it's pretty much impossible.  One player will simply spam you with a Mini-gun and the others either push or you eventually run out of mats. My squad has simply stopped dropping at places like Tilted/Retail/Lazy Links recently. If you go 1/2 men down (even if the two best players stay alive) we stand little to no chance anymore. 

Honestly imo they need to vault either the Mini-Gun or the LMG or alternatively Nerf splode damage to structures. That would be my personal preference.

If breaking the build META is the way Epic want to go then I wouldn't be completely against reducing mats. That rewards players who resource correctly, pick the right fights and position themselves well.  I could learn to deal with say max 300 for each material. 

I know this sub doesn't particularly take kindly to those who complain about this sort of thing but it's something I wanted to get off my chest. This is just my opinion, nobody is right or wrong and i'm sure Epic will get it right one way or another. I'll still be playing either way. ",FortNiteBR

(This is just my opinion feel free to disagree i'm not going to play this game anymore until things are properly balanced)

This game has Turned into a hot mess Where every fight ends in who can spray each other down faster with SMGs that can kill you in under 2 seconds.  Me and my friends just bitch about how bad shotguns are and how OP Smgs have become. Before the new smg was added  the new meta was pretty fun and good pump tac smg or tac shotgun tac smg but  this games so frustrating and broken after the update. vualting the tactical sub i just got used to using.

We're being forced to use Smgs and all these spammy weapons and explosives all added specifically to counter players who are actually good at building. Catering to casuals and defaults. You should know there's something's wrong with a game when noob players are coming in and rocking the pro players. I can literally chuck clingers at your builds and it will blow you up from the inside. 

You can't use shotguns as much anymore to shoot out builds or in close encounters because if you don't kill that enemy with your first shotgun shot you're already dead. that's how fricken quickly these new smgs can kill you.

One thing that needed to be fixed were shotguns in season 5.  Epic said all these great things about shotguns being more consistent and displaying pellets hit but this hasn't changed the consistent low damage hits you get i've never or rarely ever hit the exact amount a Tac shotguns base damage is supposed to inflict.  But for some reason in cqc an smg beats a shotgun.",FortNiteBR

While builder pro has definitely helped to bridge the gap between console and PC, there is still no custom keybinds on console, edit delay, etc. 

However how exactly would one consider m + kb cheating? Using m + kb is an advantage that is available to everyone, it’s just a question of whether someone chooses to use it or not. Also, use of a m + kb is not going to automatically turn a potato into a pro player. On the contrary, it takes an extended amount of time to get used to m + kb on console, during which time I presume you would be complete garbage while getting used to the new layout.  

A couple arguments that I have heard:

“OMG just go to PC.” This is not someone just does. I do not want to be running 15 FPS on my current setup, neither do I want to sink 1,000 bucks into a gaming rig.

“The price point prevents some people from using m + kb.” Nobody says you have to get a pro gaming mouse and keyboard. You can get a plug and play for 20 dollars that will do the trick. It is literally cheaper then a PlayStation or Xbox remote.

“They should then mouse and keyboard users into lobbies with only PC players or other PS4 mouse and keyboard era.” I am not a software engineer, but I’m going to go out on a limb and presume that unless you specifically self report, there is no reliable way to do this sort of segregation. Also, you want someone on a console to voluntarily step into lobbies with PC players running rigs with potentially up to 300 FPS when consoles are capped at 60? 

If you have gotten to the end of this post, thank you for taking the time to read this. I am just trying to understand some of the hate that is caused by mouse and keyboard users on console.

Explosives currently (mainly C4) promote extremely passive play.  It's probably different in solo's and duo's (I play mainly squads), but doing the same dance of pushing the last couple teams and getting 'sloded until I die is really wearing on me.  First time in the history of me playing Fortnite have I ever felt the need for a change to happen this severely.  I've never felt the need to take time away from Fortnite before, but I'm about there.  That being said, I've always loved how Epic is in terms map design and everything else.  The new POI's are amazing and I love the way the rotations feel, etc.  I can't help but think about how great the state of the game would be right now if the explosives got reworked/nerfed.  Anyway, I really love this game and I hope that with all of these meta changes and with almost all weapons being viable, Epic really cracks down on the balance of it all.  Everything being extremely strong is not balanced.  That being said, I love the shotgun changes, same with the new SMG taking place of the Tac SMG.  It does the same job but can't perform the same at long range, keeping it situational.   All of these changes are great, but I feel they need to tie it all together.

As a side note, there's groups of people saying that it doesn't matter about explosives being over powered because it's public matches and there really isn't anything to gain from winning or losing.  My thoughts on this is that most competitive play currently is played through public matches, so this is invalid.  Until custom games are out, this is an issue.  Even if custom games were live, the explosives still need to be toned way down, anyway.

As an ending note, I feel that explosives WILL be nerfed at some point.  I've supported Epic throughout the whole life of Fortnite, and if any team and fix an issue correctly, its this game's team.",FortNiteBR

For example, at the beginning of season 5 and more so today, when the new smg was added, I have found from my own as well as other’s experience that building will constantly get spammed down by players running up to 4 smgs or lmg type weapons. 

I am aware that epic games wants more play styles available to win besides “just Build lol”, but the addition of the shotgun delay has made it so exploiting an advantage that one player has gained over another using their building can sometimes not be rewarded like previously when shotguns could be used as burst damage over a short window of opportunity more effectively. 

I appreciate that epic games is a company that actually listens to its fan base and takes into consideration what people think, but as fortnite garners more and more new players who might complain about things like double shotgun, epic needs to realize that catering to new players, while good in the short term, will not keep your day 1 fans. 

The new players who might have complained about people using double shotgun in s4 may not know how much more OP they used to be when the original double pump was around and when they could one tap players.

MY SOLUTION - I agree that yes, at full hp, you should not be able to get one tapped by a shotgun, but by season 5 I feel like the pump has been nerfed into a state of almost irrelevancy. The pump can no longer one tap, it cannot be used in conjunction with other shotguns, and also has a pull out time.  I feel that the damage nerf to headshots with it was fine, but I believe that the body shot damage should have been left alone.  Also, if the shotgun switch timer was removed and put back to the s4 state, let’s all be honest - double pump was more fun than strong. They had a pull out delay and also could not one hit players, and along with the structure damage nerf, they were kind of ineffective in many situations.  

TLDR: the removal of double shorty has effectively lowered the variability of close range fights because before s5, you had people running just a tac, pump or heavy; or a shotgun plus smg or ar, or even double shotgun in any combination. Now, the only real effective option for the pump is using it in conjunction with an smg.  I believe that players should have more options in close range fights and the double pump of s4 was not very strong and required a higher than average skill level to execute successfully because of the pull out delay and also made a player sacrifice 2 of their 5 slots to run it.  I believe that the pump should have had the pull out delay removed because it could no longer on tap people, but the pump still possesses this trait today! 

Say what you might, but the new smg/spa weapon based meta relies more heavily on rng and bullet spread during the many spray and pray up close battle situations and also is a direct nerf to building, just like floor loot and llama nerfs. In conclusion, I want to be able to just Build lol.

86,Mogpapa,1531891515,8zso1k,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8zso1k/fortnite_season_six_theory_deluge/,20,Fortnite Season Six Theory: Deluge,"For the past two seasons, with every new week or patch something would happen. In season 4, more trees would grow in Dusty Divot, craters would be patched up, and hop rocks would be trucked out west. In season 3, the meteor would get closer and the TVs would show a distress symbol. Another thing has been the constant changing of Dusty. From three warehouses to a dig site to a dingle...it has been a long ride for the old boy. But what if something big is coming to season six, and we are just going to have sit back and watch it happen.

Fortnite has always said they wanted to change their map up. They have also released shark skins (for shark week, ik), lifeguards, and there has been talks of a Loot Lake Revamp. There is not many water locations, either. There are a few ponds besides the Lake, and that's where I need to say I think there should be a change. 

In Dusty Divot, there are a few little ponds inside of it. Where did those come from? Water doesn't just ""spawn,"" and it is not like the Divot has gotten any deeper or anything. What if the water from the divot will slowly arise, and consume the divot and eventually half the map with it? The water could consume all of Dusty by season 5's ends, and on version 6.0, perhaps Loot Lake and Dusty Divot will combine to form a Loot Lake '2.0.' 

The lake can go beside Tilted, Salty, What is left of Dusty, and be visible from Lazy. Locations could be formed, revamped, and even entirely deleted because of the overflow. 

1. Salty Springs could turn into a beach town and be renamed into Sandy Springs. It is also an excuse to flood the basement in the blue house to remove the dryness of season 4. 
2. Dusty is rebuilt! In the form of Dusty Docks, that is. The 3 warehouses could sit in a different formation with new metal, materials, and have a small cargo ship on the water next to them. Crates, Pallets, and some Divot Artifacts could be inside. There could a cargo ship alongside one or two docks.
3. Tilted has a weird little wall alongside the north and east side that looks like it'd be perfect to repel against water. There could be a really large rail bridge connecting Tilted to Lazy. It would be a perfect way to cross the lake and have awesome Bridge Ware fare. 
4. Inside of Loot Lake (2.0) will be three islands. One island will be the OG house in the middle of the current Lake. Another island be formed by the large mountain in the exact middle of the map and can be given a cool little dock and some structure. The third island could be the extremely tall mountain north of Salty. 
5. A new vehicle, the motorboat could be announced and can spawn in Sandy, Dusty, Tilted, and the northwest corner by Pleasant. This is a fast way to cross the lake and can be a really amazing way to have fights on the water. Fortnite could also add a swimming mechanic in order to cross without wasting mats or jumping for 5 minutes.

A lot of people will probably not like this idea, and I understand. This is just a cool little theory I thought to myself to freshen up the map, add a different form of fighting and some amazing new ways to play the game. If you read the whole thing, thank you so much. ",FortNiteBR

Don’t get me wrong, Epic has don’t a great job with their free to play game, but with the recent updates I feel like this game is going down hill quick. 

It all started with their shotgun nerf. Ever since then they have just equaled the playing field. Good players were able to out play and out smart their opponent, like a good BR game should. But now shotguns are and still unpredictable and it really boils down to who has more shield. 

They nerfed the shotgun to “have more variety in guns used in the game”. Then they buff the SMG. They did this for players to counter a shotgun. It was a good add since the shotguns weren’t the best close range gun in the anymore. People were able to counter a player with a shotgun and it made people play with a different strategy. Then Epic decide to vault the SMG for no apparent reason. 

I remember a couple months back they tried so hard for people to use the SMG, and they finally were able to get people to pick them up and use them and two weeks later they vault it. It just doesn’t make sense to me. 

Yeah I get it they add the new SMG instead and it is no where near as good as the previous one. 

In my opinion their ultimate goal is to lower the skill gap between good players and those who aren’t so good. But if they want a game to succeed there has to be some kind of skill gap to drive players to get better. Victory Royales need to hard to get to drive people to get better. 

All in all Epic needs to stop catering to noobs. This game will go no where in the competitive scene if they keep this up and ultimately die to the recent changes. Someone at Epic need to realize this or pretty soon this game will be a thing of the past and I don’t want this to happen.

If I am in a 1v1 with a kid with a minigun just spamming it is an easy kill. But there have been multiple times in squads where my squad dies or either falls behind me and I literally just get spammed the fuck out. Shotguns barley do any damage so it is not even worth the try to poke your head out and try to hit them. Not to mention the rpg or nade launcher. They do WAY to much damage to structures it is so annoying. I think at least two of these guns need to be vaulted. This spamming meta is non skillful and when i am outbuilding my opponents and they just hold down the trigger button and win is stupid. I have spent months to master building. but now it does not even matter because new kids just hold down the trigger button and kill me. Guns in general need to be nerfed on doing damage to structures. This game is going down the drain quickly. ",FortNiteBR

That is the spray meta, smgs and the constant eliminations of downed teammates. I write this post to get some discussion and hopefully recognized by epic. 

Spray and splodes meta: against popular opinion, this makes the game really dull. Its seems silly that one splode can break a 1x1 without much skill of aiming or predicting. There is no counter to 6 splodes from a grenade launcher as they destroy structures so much and so quickly that it makes building redundant. Alongside that, people will spray from across the map to break buildings. Its a boring play style of just aiming at one spot and spraying until the mag is unloaded and has become a greater issue with the splodes buff and smg buff.  Unloading a mag of spoldes or smgs shows no skill and just helps noobs that refuse to learn how to build gain a significant advantage. (Don't get me wrong, disengaging from a build fight and breaking out the bottom is perfectly acceptable, but giving this option for people across the map is ridiculous).

SMGs: They have been buffed so much that streamers like Daequan would rather use a white silenced smg over a gold scar (and so would I). They definitely needed a buff because they were just unusable previously and I understand epic are trying to allow for different play styles. That is perfectly fine. But i feel with the reduced bloom on the smgs, switching too an assault rifle would be silly because you miss a significant amount of shots (when compared to the smg). It needs to be changed/nerfed because at it's current state, it melts. (It's similar to how people would rather use the white pump over purple tac back in season 2)

Eliminations: This has become a gradually greater issue (with no actual fix) over the past month. I find people forget any game sense and will quickly eliminate someone downed. Previously players would eliminate at the start of the game and this was fine because my buddy (or I) would just kill ourselves and we would restart the game. That's not my issue. My problem is mid and late game, we would knock a player from the opposing team but wouldn't eliminate (he would be like a hostage if one us gets knocked). But people lack any game sense and when they knock one us down, they instantly eliminate which results in a vicious cycle of eliminating each others kills. This results with the winner of the fight to have about half his team mates left. This is not a win/win situation for either party and confuses me why people instantly eliminate in these situations.  Again, i know there is no fix for this but would just like to know if anyone is experiencing the sudden thirst to eliminate every kill, regardless of any team strategy. ",FortNiteBR

I get that double pump was OP and needed to be nerfed. But the way the game plays right now is just not fun. For example, I just had a top two scenario where I was continuously outbuilding a guy. All he was doing was standing directly beneath me and spraying my structures with the new SMG. I repeatedly gained high ground and he repeatedly shot down my structures. Eventually, we end up in the same 1 by 1 and it's essentially a 50/50 shot who wins the fight.  
  
Is this fun for anyone? My favorite times in this game are when I get into epic build-offs with someone else who's competent, even if I don't come out on top. Epic's repeated attempts to make the game more noob-friendly (see: explosives and SMG buffs) are really turning me off of this game. I have always tried to use building to avoid getting into 1 on 1 fights in open space because the gunplay in this game is ass. With SMGs currently able to shred structures faster than they can be built, it's getting harder and harder to do so.

Sometimes it works great, with the only down time being the loading screen. But sometimes, like today, I've logged on to discover that the mic that has been working for weeks with nothing changed now doesn't work with voice chat. My friend plays on the PS4 and she wants to play with me. Except, the microphone on Fortnite on her PS4 also suddenly doesn't work, even though both mics are confirmed to work on discord and Playstation chat.

The point is, I'm sick of hassling with it, I've had problems with it in the past and it's irritating as hell that it only worked for a few weeks before breaking again.

Please somebody give me an alternative way that I can speak to my friend on voice chat with her still being able to hear the game. She's not going to wear earbuds under her headphones because that's not comfortable and she shouldn't have to compromise only because the voice chat system doesn't work properly. The only voice chat on PS it seems like is the Playstation Chat, but you can't download anything like that on PC.  ",FortNiteBR

In game, in the lobby, whatever. If I'm in game, the game will continue to display on screen, but I won't be able to interact with anything, and status bars (being revived, drinking shield, etc) stay stuck where they are. Completely frozen, except audio. I can still hear chests around me, and I can still talk to my teammates.

I'm not even able to alt+tab out of the game. I have to ctrl+alt+del, go to task manager, and then it *still* won't let me tab out, but it will bring up the alt+tab menu. In the menu, it shows the Unreal Engine crash reporter. Can't report though, because I can't leave the game. So I have to ctrl+alt+del again, sign out, and log back in. Then it'll usually work until it crashes again.

Twice, though, it's completely shut down my computer and sent it to the Windows Repair screen, once a few minutes AFTER I logged back in to my Windows user account.

I don't believe this is a problem with my computer. It's a brand new bug with the 5.0 update, as far as I know.

***How is it gonna work?***

It's simple. So BRS should never be based of wins as people can camp it out and kill the last player, it's not hard to do. But it should be based on KDR and placement. If you come first place and only get 1 kill that can keep your rank the same or move up one rank, on the other hand if you place 7th  and get 10 kills that can make your rank go up because you had a better KD.

***Where can you see your rank?***

you will be able to see your rank in the career tab. There would be a a tab that says rank you can easily see your rank and your last 10 games with your placement and kills beside it.  Why do this? Everybody has different reasons, mine being to stop fake non skins.

***How do they work?***

To differ the ranks from other games they should go up in the gun rarity colours! eg. White 5 White 4 White 3 White 2 White 1 \~ Green 5 Green 4 Green 3 Green 2 and so on.

Please consider this epic, people may not think it will be a great change but its all for the better and i feel like its the perfect idea! Throw your ideas in the comments and tell me what you think would be cool for the rank system.",FortNiteBR

However, I would like to be able to support Epic's team, and the current half price sale on StW is a great chance for this. 

My only concerns are that we have had no indication as to when it will be released for free (apart from it being some time in 2018), nor what the founder's benefits will be, and I don't want to spend £17.50 if the public release will be coming shortly -I don't have a lot of time for gaming so wouldn't be worth burning money. The gave itself looks fun, but appears repetitive, which is another stalling point. 
Also, there has been very little official discussion on how VBucks will be handled once the full game is released- clearly the transferability across the two game modes is one of the main benefits (relating to what I said earlier, if I really cared about the cosmetics that much I would have already invested but wouldn't say no to effectively free skins), so losing this perk in the short term is concerning.

People who own StW, do you have a better idea when the release date will be based on how complete the game currently feels? Would you buy the game now if you hadn't already? Do you expect big bonuses when the game is released or are you content with paying just to have the early access? And does anyone have any further info/ recommendations? Thanks :)",FortNiteBR

I don't love it, I don't hate it, and I will use it if I feel the need to.

Some of you, evidently, put a little too much faith in building. I just got out of a match where I had a build battle with another player at twisted towers. For 2-3 minutes we built on top of each others' structures, with me being the aggressor. During this time he never fired a shot. In fact I never even saw him pull out his gun. Ultimately he died, doing absolutely no damage to me, and leaving me confused with what I just witnessed. I guess he was banking on me accidentally falling..

Anyways, building is very useful, and I am glad it is in the game, but in the end your gun is going to be what gets you kills, being a little aggressive and putting the blueprints away may net you some better games.

They are vaulting the tac SMG, one of my friends and my favorite gun for this new gun that further unbalances SMGs as a whole. I miss Dusty Divot and factories. That was the place that got me out of my bush-wookie phase into running around and embracing combat. I learned to build and fight in the fields to the south of Dusty. The divot is just a huge hole in the ground that everyone avoids like loot lake. What happened to balanced player distribution before tilted and new spots had half the server going to them. I may just be stubborn to the new change but I enjoyed the laid-back nature fortnite gave me, now it feels Epic are trying to hard. The pre-release style that fortnite had is what I enjoyed.

i have games where i just get destroyed so hard and that for hours and a few games where i do good but still not win

my building skills are pretty good i can build fast and edit fast my aim is getting better since i changed my sensitivity and dpi 3 days ago

i think my biggest problem is positioning, i heard that positioning is the key to get better

So as i said i really need some tips on how to improve since i am really sad how my peformance is even tho i play since late season 3 im just not happy how i play :(

Is there any tips you guys can give me on positioning and how to improve the gameplay to be more consistent? i dont really care about wins because i know wins doesnt mean anything but if i am happy with my gameplay in a round that i did not win im fine with that.

Hopefully someone can help me out with some tips on positioning and improving my gameplay :D

Thanks in advance :)",FortNiteBR

Streamers have been constantly talking about it and yet you don't listen to the one people who bring in the most players. 

I'm tired of getting the high ground and some kid chucking C4 over and over and over and over and over again just to knock me down and then once i'm at the bottom they use the broken ass SMG to just laser me through my build. It's about time you guys do something for your community. 


Suggestions:
Nerf the explosion radius.
Limit the amount of C4 a player can carry. I'm tired of people throwing 10 C4 at me. That's a bit excessive.
If you're going to leave the damage where it's at, max carry 4 C4.
Stacks of 2. Not 4.

I would suggest moving away from the “Streamer Mode” nomenclature and instead have an “Anonymous Mode” that just shows your skin name instead of claiming you are a streamer. Other players will still only b shown by their skin name. 

In my mind this removes any “unfair” traits the mode currently holds and keeps every name in the game from being “Streamer (XYZ)” like it has been for me recently.

I'd like to have an open discussion about this, and keep in mind all of the following is my personal opinion.

1 - Explosives. Explosives are extremely OP right now. All of them. I realize the changes were meant to give players another strategy to win fights other than building, but instead it just promotes slow, passive gameplay. You CANNOT rush someone who has any sort of explosives now. If you ramp towards them and work for high ground, no matter what kind of build you do, it takes 1-2 rockets to destroy the entire thing. There's no point in building for high ground anymore against these players. You're just wasting mats at that point.

In addition to that, clingers need to be nerfed or vaulted. If you didn't know, if you're boxed in, all you have to do is throw 2 clingers at the wall. The first will blow up your entire box and the 2nd will do damage to you. All at the same time. If someone throws clingers at your box, you better have quick reactions to edit out or you're dead.

2 - Spamming Meta. Epic keeps adding more and more weapons that promote just holding left mouse / Right trigger. Let's count how many of these weapons there are. 1, LMG 2, Minigun, 3, Drum gun, 4/5 both SMGs. These guns also have such a fast kill time that if you're at the start of the game with no mats going up against someone with one of these weapons, if you don't kill them with 1 shotgun shot, you're dead before you can get the 2nd shot off. Epic has basically traded double pump, which required skill somewhat to time it correctly, for holding down left click / rt

TL;DR - Epic has turned fortnite into an explosives / LMG spam fest that takes no skill and is 99% random",FortNiteBR

Dear shopping cart, 

I still love you

Even though others now look above you.

They've moved on to their shiny new golf-carts,

But I have always loved you, from the start.

You've been there for me, since the beginning

Even though you knew I had no chance of winning.

My friends say I'm bad at the game, which is true,

The only thing I am good at is driving you.

From Greasy Grove, to Pleasant Park,

You were a part of me, like a birthmark.

But the reason I'm writing to you today,

Is to tell you, ""Please don't go away"".

In my mind, as long as I play,

You'll always be better than any ATK.

So farewell, I'll see you soon!

We'll have a great time together, killing noobs.

Sincerely, 

Your Favorite Tomatohead

The game needs something to really work towards. Rewards like skins or gliders that are earned by your performance, whether that's:

- Raw win numbers. (Gold umbrella for 1000 life time wins)

- Or kill count  (golden knight for 10,000 lifetime kills) 

-Or stat ranking (top 1% of players get a golden  pickaxe)

Something to work towards that's so coveted you don't see one in every lobby. Something that you will probably never get, but the possibility keeps you coming back. The thrill of the chase for that carrot on the stick. 

Not another tier 100 skin that, by the end of the season, every lobby will have 40 people wearing it.

Thankfully FortNite has drastically improved in this regard since its launch, but I would still like to see a slight reduction in maximum ADS bloom across most guns and an increase in visual recoil. 

Recently on this sub there has been a lot of talk about shotguns/double pump meta going away and how player ""skill"" should be of utmost importance when balancing guns. But I don't often see requests to replace the aggressive arbitrary accuracy penalties that do nothing but force combat into regulated engagement distances with a more skill based recoil alternative. In a similar vein to CSGO, weapons could have unique recoil patterns (SMGs could pull straight up while ARs could pull more horizontally for example.) As of right now, almost every gun doesn't even move when you shoot it, and the game decides whether your next shot hits, not you. In an ideal world I would rather my gun be very difficult to control and keep on target with sustained fire, but at least reliably have the bullets go where I aim. 

Overall, I believe that this would do nothing but increase the skill ceiling in the game and allow players to see greater results from practicing with certain guns. I'm definitely not calling for an end to all weapon bloom, just a humble suggestion to spark discussion.",FortNiteBR

Casual player, decided to try and pay more attention during Season 5 and take a crack at the BattlePass. After reading through Reddit, I've gathered that there have been a couple of events - and maybe an ongoing narrative? - hidden through the Battle Royale mode up until now.  


From what I can gather, there was a comet that crashed during between Season 3 and 4 (Dusty Depot -&gt; Dusty Divot) and there was some sort of Super Hero movie being filmed that ended with a Rocket Launch that possibly opened a time rift but we aren't sure yet, but that's the theme of Season 5?   


I'm wondering what happened before the comet. Also, can people elaborate on my poor summary? Who is The Visitor? Are there other key points I'm missing that are relevant?

I just want to get this out there. I just think the rapid weapon meta is a problem because of the weapons they are replacing. It is fun compared to the shotgun spamfest of kangaroos I just think there are too many issues with this meta. I will list the problems. But first a side note. Our friend the tac smg was removed and I loved it before it was buffed. A purple tac smg was my go to but they got rid of it. Now here are some problems with the meta.

1. The best weapons are common-rare: Legendary weapons have to be good. If not they are a fail. But if a rare or common weapon is top of the meta there is a problem. The regular smg, the newest addition is so much more powerful than the tac and has smaller rarity. So you can currently get the strongest weapon in the game in the first house you go to? That's not right. All of the strong very easy to find OP guns need nerfs and maybe a higher rarity version if you like the OP ones. 
2. The higher rarity rapid weapons are weaker: Not only are our favorite subs and drums being king of the world with a rare rarity but the only two epic rarity and the one legendary rarity rapid fire weapon is weaker. The minigun does have unlimited amo and high dps but it does not do nearly as much as a submachine gun. Sure you would still take it but side by side with another smg. And then there is the lmg. It's an epic but is very lackluster. It's not that good at it's forte witch is range. Don't get me started with the tactical submachine...
3. The new rapid weapons replaced everything: So far the only weapons people will use are rapid weapons, maybe a pump shotgun, rocket and nade launcher and the bolt action and I think maybe the newly buffed semi-auto. The assault rifles are rarely used and even scars are having trouble. Burst are also no no's. The drum gun is a close range weapon and is so much better than shotguns. I'm really sure the smg's were supposed to be the midrange masters. A stronger scar without range but now it's just the scar that's good at everything. 

The way they are indirectly nerfing building is interesting and the pace of the game is sweet but unlike what some say this game does not have any more variety than it did with the pump meta. I think if the smg, surpressed smg and the drum gun, maybe added a gun similar to these guns at a higher rarity in the future, and maybe just help balance the difference of AR, pumps and smg's this game would be super great. Please state your opinion. I respect If you all flat out reject this I just have an opinion.",FortNiteBR

Explosives have proven to be too OP and needs to be nerfed just a bit.,"So been watching the 250k summer skirmish and playing games myself to come to the conclusion that explosives are a tab bit too powerful. Lemme explain:

In the pro tournament it literally came down to who had clingers and nade launchers in the end game. I thought ""well its pro scene so its a different play style"". Then I thought back about all my past games and realized that this is generally the case. In the final circle if you had nade launchers or rpgs you had a 75% favorable outcome even with the nerf in explosive ammo.
     -it doesnt matter that you can only hold 12 rpg ammo when each rpg u shoot destroyes 4x the amount of structures. Its almost equivalent to having 48 rpg ammo.
     -I personally found it easier to fight against 48 rpg shots pre buff than against 2 rpg shots that destroyed everything around it.

My proposed solution is to make the explosives destroy the structure it impacts on and do maybe half damage to everything around? So sort of a middle ground between how explosives used to work vs how they work now. This is just a rough idea and I understand it might not work well until tested.

Lemme know what you think.",FortNiteBR

**The removal of the double pump has made this game worse.** I know, heresy. But the pump had already undergone a series of drastic nerfs that made it a fraction of the monster it was in S3. Recap of the nerfs?

-	Reduced damage 90/95 to 80/85 
-	Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
-	Pullout delay
-	Reduced damage to structures (2 shots cannot take down a wooden structure anymore)

I might be missing some, who knows. 

Point is, by the end of S4, after their buffs, SMGs were incredible weapons to pair with a pump, *and arguably even better* than carrying a second pump. 

A week ago, you had the flexibility of carrying any combination you wanted for CQC: Pump + SMG, Pump + Pump, Pump + Tac, Pump + Heavy, etc etc. 

Now, weapon switching between two shotguns is gone. The current tactic is to shred your opponents with weapons that do 220+ *damage per second.* Considering the nerfs the pump went through, it makes ZERO sense that this is seen as the more “skilled” way of playing by the community.

That, combined with C4, and the splodes buff in general has made this meta an all time low for Fortnite, IMO.",FortNiteBR

When I first downloaded and launched fortnite, it automatically set the settings to all high, but for some reason every 5 seconds it would stutter severely,  sometimes even down to 10 fps. Could it Be the ram? Or could it be optimization issues due to season 5? I personally think it's the ram, as I've seen that 4gb to 8gb actually makes a huge difference in terms of frame stability in games. I've also seen benchmarks of fortnite with the same components of mine except that they had 8gb and the ram usage is usually 6000 mb or approx. 6gb. HELP",FortNiteBR

And now onto my second reason bloom. Bloom is the worst thing to have in a game were the meta is now smg, it was fine at the start of season 3 and the middle of season 4 because first shot acc got introduced and because it was a build shotgun meta but now it has moved on to a smg meta it is RNG to whether or not your bullet will hit. I feel it is unfair to the players that have been grinding to get good and now they can loss a gun fight just because some guy got lucky and hit all his shots. 

So the primary reason I'm quitting is due to the bloom making it luck base to if I kill someone or not.   

I also want to add that Epic are a good company witch is trying there hardest to make the game fun for everyone.

sniper got a really good buff which it can down/kill players with 75 health (bandage cap) in end-game situations. People can prefer it to bolt action because of firerate and the new stats of it. But be careful that bullet drops faster than bolt action and hunting rifle.

**My thoughts on this:** I am going to take Semi over hunting rifle now because of DPS. Goodbye hunting rifles!

# SMG (new one)

the new smg is tactical smg but better. It has a bug right now which instead of getting smg from chests, you get nothing. Its quite common but the fact that you cant get it from chests makes it a little bit harder to find. Its rarities/damage are:

\- common : 19

\- Uncommon : 20

\- Rare : 21

People cant understand the difference between suppressed smg and normal smg but its too obvious, smg is short range king and supressed variant of it is basically better than ARs.

**My thoughts on this:** This is a beast and proves the strength of mp5. It melts through buildings and has good sounds. Definitely the best choice for light bullets.",FortNiteBR

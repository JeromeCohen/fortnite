Hello everyone.

This is the interview with Tyler Buck i was talking about in my previous post.

The interview is a direct translation from dutch to english.

I ask about which emotes and skins after we finished the interview.

he did mention the rogue agent skin ask the first starter pack skin.

you can find a screenshot of my previous post here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9g1wfc/guys\_this\_post\_got\_removedmaybe\_by\_epic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9g1wfc/guys_this_post_got_removedmaybe_by_epic/)

&amp;#x200B;

After the great success of Fortnite, many people wonder where it all started.

I spoke with Tyler Buck he was closely involved in making Fortnite in the last 7 years and it was not easy.

&amp;#x200B;

the year of the idea.

Here at Epic games we do a game jam four times a year.

This is the moment that we all start brainstorming and come up with great ideas for our next titles.

We wanted to imitate the success of Minecraft and the popular shooters in a game.

Call of duty was in 2011 one of the most popular games on the market and a large part of the players did the zombie mode.

By combining all these games the idea for Fortnite arose.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The development of Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

Making Fortnite lasted for no more than 7 years.

A lot happened during the development of Fortnite.

We started Fortnite with unreal engine 3 and this later changed to unreal engine 4.

Also the art style of the game was changed to make it more child friendly.

Later in the process, many colleagues unfortunately left the development team at Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What was your share in fortnite?

&amp;#x200B;

During my training I started at the customer service of Epic games.

Later I went to work as a soundman at Epic games and I made a lot of sounds for fortnite.

Later I started working in the marketing team.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The release of Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

It was super the feedback we received from the players was great but of course we were not ready yet.

2 months later the release of the battle was royal fashion.

Of course, Fortnite quickly became popular in the first week after the release of battle royale, we already had 10 million players.

&amp;#x200B;

What are you doing now?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been away for a while and have been working for Chair entertainment for a new title Spyjinx.

Now I am back at Epic games and I work for the Fortnite marketing team.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What does your work exactly mean?

&amp;#x200B;

We look at which items are in the item shop and battle pass.

We do this both for the save the world and for the battle royale version.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How will the upcoming weeks look like for season 6?

&amp;#x200B;

It starts with the purple cube of course.

It's going to take a while, but something great is going to happen.

We will also see the return of old items that are in high demand.

As we have already done with the power chord skin.

The first starter pack skin also comes back.

And a few of the most popular items of season 2 and 3.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What should I imagine with the items of season 2 and 3?

First comes a day that we are going to sell 2 items in the item shop.

Next comes a day with items from season 3.

These are not only items from the battle pass but this will be the last time the items are available.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Which items does this mean?

&amp;#x200B;

From season 2 the fortnite fever set the floss and wave emote. From season 3 the dark voyager and vanguard with the 2 most popular emotes the best mates and take the L.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How do you see the future of Fortnite?

&amp;#x200B;

This year a lot of work was done on save the world.

In the beginning of season 6 canny valley is finished.

Stonewood and Plankerton will be free for everyone from the second week of season 6.

In battle royale the bunker finally opens in wailing woods and of course there is the cube that starts us with a hard bang season 6.",FortNiteBR

It’s epics choice if they want to bring the skins back and it’s up to them how happy there fan base is, if they bring them back some players will be upset, some will be happy, and some won’t care at all. But u guys gotta remember it’s a skin that a lot of people want but don’t have, think of it as a business opportunity if they were to bring them back they’d make a bunch of money. 
How would u feel if they brought these skins back. Would u bet upset? Happy or just wont care? And would u understand why epic brought them back?

C4 explodes in a series where one explodes and the next will explode a second and after and so fourth.

The current state of C4 results in the first C4 will explode all building whether player built of naturally occurring in game and the next two will explode and damage the player for 70 hp - If multiple c4 are placed this has NO counter.

This means that if an entire stack of C4 is placed on top of you have just 1/2 a second to react by using loot such as bouncers/launchers which you wont always have and isn't possible when in a POI building.

C4 should explode all at once where effectively if three C4 are placed on top of each other they would do as much damage as one and would't damage the buildings to be able to reach the player - but if people spaced out their placement they would get more use. This would force players to think about where players may move after the explosion and place their second c4 as fourth instead of spamming them all and getting a free kill.

TL;DR C4 shouldnt explode intermittently instead they should all explode at once so that they will destroy structures but not cause a free chain reaction of destroying all building with the first then 1/2 second later the subsequent explosives kill the player with no possible response from the person being targeted.

It could have higher per-shot damage than other rifles and lower fire rate, but lower damage per shot than snipers, and wouldn't have to be reloaded after each shot. Basically picture the hunting rifle, but with like, 5-10 shots in the clip, and less damage. I'd say you could shoot it about as fast as the auto-sniper does, but each shot is one trigger pull, whereas the auto-sniper can be held down.

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/callofduty/images/3/3f/Mk14_menu_icon_MW3.png/revision/latest?cb=20111112141831

And

A very short range, but full-auto shotgun like the AA-12. Like I said, short range, best for spraying through walls and tearing buildings apart. It could have about 10 rounds in it and have very large spread. To me, the heavy shotgun and double barrel are the purple and gold variants of the pump shotgun, so the AA-12 could be the purple and gold variant of the tactical.

It was super surprising how easy it was to win.  After the fifth win, we just didn't want to play it anymore and went back to regular squads.

As you shoot, tap fire don’t go full-auto. Watch in amazement as your shots are supremely accurate to before and watch how the bloom never has time to expand

If you don't like this stuff, you don't need to read it.*

I started early in Season 5 with a thread talking about how the seasons story so far has been disapointing. Many people replied that, well, it's only the beginning of the season, just wait and it'll all come together.

I think it's been enough time to talk about it.

This seasons storyline has not only been disapointing, but damaging to the people who appreciate a good story in their online games. The closest analogy would be MMORPG's that have storys that unfold during the course of an expansion packs life cycle. It's been done before and Fortnite won't be the last to do it.

Whats important to a good story? I'm sure everyone was told that a story needs a beginning, middle, and end. We can apply this to various media, but two good examples we can look at are stories that are seperated into multiple parts, sort of like how Fortnite is broken down into Seasons.

Two really simple examples everyone are familar with would be Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. In LOTR? We know what the goal is. We need to get from the Shire, to Mordor, and destroy the ring. Every action or event that occurs in the book/movie is in some way, shape or form related to this final goal or is a result of the pursuit of this final goal. We know where it's going, and at the end of every book we have an idea of how far away this is.

Harry Potter is a little bit more apt comparing to Fortnite. What happens in Harry Potter? Well, we have the overall bad dude that we know likely needs to be addressed at some point by the end of the series. But every book is also segmented into distinct parts - every single book is a year at the school. We know that Harry Potter will begin a book starting his year at Hogwarts, and will end the year completing that year. Many things will happen during the course of the year, but they will all wrap up by the end of it, and he will be 1 year closer to graduating (and probably one year closer to having to fight Voldemort)

But what has Fortnites season been like? Each story sort of has a beginning, and a middle, but no end. Each stories middle is the start of a new story. There has been no conclusion to any storyline so far.

What was the meteor? Well it carried the Visitor. Was it deliberate? Was there some reason the Visitor was on it? We don't know. All we know is he launched the rocket.

But what did the rocket do. It opened a dimensional portal. Cool, but why? Was the visitor on it? Well we don't know. So the visitor could still be around right now? Totally possible.

Well who are these enforcer guys? Nobody knows. Well whats the deal with the cube? It seems to be up to something, obviously starting Season 5, but what is it's purpose? We've seen how the dimensional rifts work so far, and it seems like stuff that gets teleported by the rifts eventually gets teleported back. Durr Burger sign went to our world, and came back but brought Drift. Tomato Town sign ended up going to another world, and brought the Temple back with it... Everything that went out, came back.

But that leaves the Cube - was this something the Visitor wanted? Or was it just another thing sucked in and it's just up to whatever it's gonna do? Are the Enforcers part of this? Are they after the Visitor, the Cube, or are they an SCP Foundation type deal that wants to correct all the dimensional nonsense?

The main problem with Fortnites story, so far, has been nothing even feels connected. There is no narative, there is no story line to speak of. There is no End to any of the things that have occurred to date. All we have had are things that a series of connected events happening that seem without purpose.

Or to apply it to the two examples above: Is Fortnite LOTR? Well, we have no idea if all these events are part of the Visitor, where it is, or why it's happening. So we can't say it's that. Is Fortnite more like Harry Potter? Well, if we had something extra that showed a story has come to a close? It would help. Was the Visitor on the rocket and went home, and everything else is just a side effect of that rockets portal technology? Or did the Visitor want the cube here? Since the seasons aren't actually ending, and are the start of a new season, so it's not really that HP style either.

It's sad cause there seems to be a lot of potential for Fortnite's story. A lot of what has happened is very compelling. Maybe someone will try and tie it all together later on. But it really seems like this story is going nowhere fast, and Season 6 will just be another series of happenings that will result in Season 7.

But as it stands there is really no narative here. There is no story. Maybe one day there will be. Or maybe not. Maybe the goal is just to keep doing things like the road trip loading screens - some dude gets teleported into Fortnite, hangs out at pool parties, and then we will never know if he gets teleported back or is stuck here.

Why do you need to know if Drift ever gets home or accomplished anything if you can know that the cube has evil sauce inside of it?",FortNiteBR

I feel they could easily tweak it to make it spawn less and/or drop the damage a bit. Anything to bring back that sweet, sweet weapon that brought me so much joy.

When I was reviewing the current builder pro configuration I noticed what could be a simple fix.  


Why can't '**Edit Build**' just be set to **L3** (Left Joystick)? It's the only spot that remains unused on the controller and a viable option at that since it allows the player to keep their fingers on both joysticks. This seems like an easy and quick enough fix for EPIC to do in the mean time as in-game custom controller button remapping could be some time away.  


It may even benefit those who use a consoles' built-in button remapping feature to swap **X/A** and **L3** to allow jumping without letting go of the joysticks**,** as it would leave **X/A** as a designated edit button on *Tap*. Especially since most players who do this toggle 'Auto-Run' anyway.  


If this is not possible, I would like to at least leave a suggestion that you add mapping for both the *Tap*, and *Hold* variants of each button, as it would technically allow for more freedom when assigning buttons/triggers.

Battle Royale is a popular genre right now. Every company is trying to hop on the bang wagon. But, it will die. When BR fades out of popularity, Fortnite will be dragged down with it. Fortnite will have to change to stay relevant. 

Fortnite could adapt by become more like Battlefield. Focusing on large battles and game modes like 50v50, where’d the building aspect wouldn’t be lost. 

It’d be best if Fortnite could change its progression. Instead of having just skins. It could choose to give each skins certain, but not overpowered, perks. Which can be expanded to make that character better. For example: Sky Stalker could have less accuracy (cause he’s always wearing a gas mask) but a high resistance to gas grenades. While Bandolier has a higher ammo capacity at the cost of slower speed. ",FortNiteBR

I realized that wins don’t mean much considering how random the game can be. The loot where you land, who has shield, who has less bloom, etc is all random. Say finding a double barrel in tilted, you’re gonna demolish a lot of the folks who land and only find pistols. 

Not to mention, you can be in a lobby with Ninja, Tfue, and Myth and get slaughtered end game because well, you had no chance once those guys looted up properly. Contrary to that, those same guys can be in your lobby and immediately die just because the loot sucked and you’re getting lucky by having to 1v1 a guy who’s sitting in a bush getting excited because he’s never been in the top 2. 

As far as KD goes, it’s fairly random too. I defer to my point about the loot drop. Other than that, I have a cousin who plays mostly squads. We play together and while I have more solo wins, higher KD, better overall stats in solo, etc. My KD in squads is horrible. The reason behind that is because I usually take front line and chip away at the teams health but I’ll be knocked before I can take anybody out. I can reduce 4 guys health from 200 to 1 but my cousin could come out with a pickaxe and tap them each once and get 4 kills as a result. Not knocking him on it but, it shows how volatile KD can be. It’s a little more consistent in solo however, you can still be kicking ass but because there’s not shield/bandages, you’ll die by a dude spamming his smg. Contrary to that, getting third or fourth partied early on is pretty much GG for you. 

End game becomes a little more consistent in all modes, once the number drops to 50 and there isn’t so much chaos, it makes for more prolific 1v1s that aren’t usually attributed to luck but once again, I defer to my point about inconsistent loot or RNG. 


Granted, I know these mechanics are all how the game stays fair and I’m not saying the game is unfair or whining that I have bad luck or whatever, I’m just asking what exactly makes a good player, despite the randomizer. 

I realized that damage to players and score per match is pretty important. Damage to players per game to the ratio of damage taken IMO is a sign of how good somebody is but it only goes on a game by game basis. Score is good because it takes all of the stats and combines them into one but at the same time, you can sit in a bush all day and stay until the top 5 and get a 200 score because of it lol.

No, it was random, some people had a crossbow, some people even had a frying pan, and some people had good guns. 

It's that excitement of not knowing what gun you're gonna get that makes a battle royale.

And it feels awesome when you get a bad weapon, and still manage to take out an enemy with a better more powerful gun, battle royale is supposed to put you in a situation where you have to look for the guns you want, anything can happen, and if you get a bad gun at the beginning, you have to adapt to the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now there's no bad guns in the game, I know when I land there's gonna be tons of shotguns, SMG's, assault rifles everywhere, it personally takes out part of the fun for me, some people may hate on weapons like the crossbow, or the Tec-9, but these weapons added something to fortnite. You may only find an assault rifle and a crossbow, maybe on the way out of where you landed you see an enemy and get some crossbow hits on them, now that person is most likely just gonna have a bunch of long ranged weapons regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I think battle royales need to have bad guns to be like ""Hey you're at the start of the game, this is the gun you have, try to survive.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's more just a case of ""Oh yeah I'm gonna land and grab these weapons.""

Sure you could get different rarities, a common AR, or a Gold Scar, but there's a huge difference between a gold scar and the old SMG, if you killed a guy with a gold scar using the old SMG, you beat the odds and also got that players gun off of him as an award.

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you guys get what I mean? Having a random variety of guns adds a lot to battle royale, and you can't say you didn't feel awesome the first time you got a crossbow kill.",FortNiteBR

Hey all! As we approach the seasons final days, things have been picking up significantly with our pal Kevin The Cube and its whereabouts! This thread is here to talk about and discuss The Cube! All we know is HOW The Cube was formed was from a huge lightning strike that happened about a month ago, that shook the entire Fortnite universe wild... And then a wild cube appeared...

#**CUBE MECHANICS AND WHAT IT IS:** 

So far, we already know what the cube does when you mess with it. 

* The Cube has a shield-regen aura, but it is fairly slow. 

* The rate of when you regenerate a shield around The Cube, is 1SP (shield-point) for every 2 seconds.

* If you shoot at The Cube, it will zap back at you and it *WILL* deal damage. 

* The Cube deals 30 damage to you or whoever is closest when you shoot at it.

* That in mind, if you shoot at it, it will try and target you, any structures in the way will be destroyed. Only one structure can be destroyed at a time

* The Cube is almost in a sense like a bounce pad, you can bounce on the top of it, and bounce from the walls. Keep in mind you will deal fall damage from jumping from the cube at a tremendous distance if you fall out of its field.   

* When The Cube is making a mark, there's a low-gravity field around it, thus making you immune from fall damage (only in the field The Cube created) 

#**LINKS TO THREADS AND DOCUMENTATION:**

As of right now, we have gathered all of the following:

&amp;#x200B;

I will just dive right into it.. I've been playing Fortnite since early Season 2 and i've had the same PC since i started (and i admit it is really really bad PC specs but i havent been able to upgrade: Core 2 Duo @ 2.33Ghz 6 GB DDR2 RAM 2 GB DDR3 VRAM Win10 64 BIT)

&amp;#x200B;

In Season 2 i was just playing because my friends were playing the game, but actually the game was running insanely bad for me because there was no optimization at all so i wasnt enjoying the game that much.

&amp;#x200B;

In Season 3 there was actually some nice optimizations which helped me a lot to actually play the game a lot more smoother (even though i was using 1280 10:9 resolution), so i was really happy because i could now start grinding with my friends and i actually did improve a lot my building.

&amp;#x200B;

In Season 4 there was more optimizations which helped me even more and i could play the game at 30 - 40 FPS most of the time (while having some massive FPS drops some times, which almost all the time lead to me being killed because i couldn't see/move for around 2 sec until the FPS came back up)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In early Season 5 i believe there was a slightly performance update and now i started using custom resolution (1024 x 768 4:3) and i was getting around 45 - 55 FPS which was obviously better than 30 FPS. And ofcourse i still had those massive FPS drops (and i know it was because of my PC, not because of the game).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But now since 5.40 Patch i literally can't play Fortnite anymore. When i go into a Solo game (or even Duos/Squad) i actually can't even loot fast enough because buildings/trees won't load as fast as the used to before the 5.40 Patch, so i have to wait around the buildings until they load and then go in and loot (sometimes it takes even more than 5minutes to load 2 houses (those on the east side of Lazy Links, between Risky Reels). I also have friends that used to run the game at medium settings at 120+ FPS and now they can barely stay over 60 FPS because they get massive FPS drops when before 5.40 Patch they didn't.

Im doing this post because i think Epic haven't addressed this issue properly. I have read that Patch 5.40.1 actually fixed this problem for a lot of users but i can say for myself and my friends (that actually have a way better PC than me) that the problem isn't really fixed. As i said above, now i just can't even play because load times of houses/tree and even lobby before entering the Battle Bus are way longer than before. Now i have to use 1280 10:9 resolution because somehow it helps loading houses/tree a little bit faster than using 1024 x 768.

&amp;#x200B;

¿Do you guys still have this same problem after 5.40.1 ""fix""? I would like to read them :)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, hope you guys can thumbs this up so maybe an Epic employee sees it and fixes it for Season 6, because i still really like to play the game but i just can't do it anymore as how it is right now. Thanks a lot.",FortNiteBR

 • (A) Mountain NE of Loot Lake 
   Gives good cover from enemies, decent view, and overall a A+ spot.

• (B) Factories near docks
 Great view of the event, okay cover, overall a B+

• (C) Hovering over Lake
Amazing protection, good view, overall A+

• (D) Brick Wall from Tilted (NW of Lake)
 Good view, bad cover, overall C

• (E) House in middle of Lake 
360° view, terrible cover, overall B

• (F) Elevated House (East)
 Great view, bad cover (most likely to be popular viewing spot), overall C

• (G) Nowhere near Loot Lake 
Amazing cover, worst view ever, overall a D--

It really just comes down to what you're looking for. Want protection? I recommend: A,C, and G. Want a good view? Try: B, D, E, and F. Want to miss out on an amazing event? Try G.

The pump needs less bullet spread and an increase in headshot damage, it is just not good anymore. I noticed this after playing a couple of games today and going against double barrel users.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into this build fight, it got really close range as the guy had a grapple, I shoot him in the head with the pump, dealing 150 damage, then I switch to my smg, before I can switch to my smg, the guy hits me with the barrel twice and kills me. I'm like, shouldn't I be rewarded somehow for landing a nice headshot on the guy, while he just needs to spray that double barrel in my toe and deal over 150? 

&amp;#x200B;

Because this season isn't about the storyline, its about having fun. This season brought so many fun things, like rifts, toys, atks, golf, and the summer themed skins.

Epic waited until late in the season to start the storyline (which will continue in season 6 btw) so we could all enjoy the summer and just have fun playing the game. The theme ""worlds collide"" is loose, but epic has stayed true to that theme, introducing present day skins, viking era skins, norse skins, skins from the 40s, 50s, 80s, 90s, etc.

Epic has also used this season to introduce new mechanics, and experiment with the meta of the game. They've also been using it for feedback, adjusting the meta, improving transportation, midgame, the storm, along with adding new ltms to keep everything fresh, and an ltm with rewards for playing, and a skin/starter pack to match. They've also come to a point where 50v50 is the best it's ever been.

TL;DR

It's just for fun

also just build lol",FortNiteBR

With all the recent additions into the item pool, I feel as though there are so many must haves and not all items are created equal.

Since about Season 2 I have felt that it wasn't worthwhile to carry grenades and the same still holds true today. No matter how useful stinks, shockwaves, a stack of 10 frags, or even the recently announced port-a-fortress may be, you simply can't justify carrying them over something like a grappler, a sniper, or meds.

Most people's loadout probably looks like this:

1. AR
2. Sniper
3. Shotty
4. SMG (can negate if you have a Tac, but most people won't due to the meta and shotguns being ASS)
5. Meds.

The only thing you can really cut from that list is MAYBE the sniper if you're an aggressive player like me. Most of the really good players won't leave a grappler behind, it's too good to not use. That leaves absolutely no room for a max stack of any of the grenades, much less a fucking port-a-fort(ress). I love the nades, I love the port-a-forts in concept, but you can never justify carrying them. Stinks are so good too, but their limited use will never match the value that a gun with replenishable ammo provides.

I'm not sure if it is a good idea yet, but having a dedicated grenade slot would add more tactical play into the game (because grenades in games are usually all about different utility). Obviously if such a thing made its way into the game, the stack sizes might need to be looked at, but other than that, I think it'd be interesting. You would lose the ability to carry more than one type, but that restriction would allow you to keep the current power of these items. Would you rather have 5 grenades? 3 stinks? A port-a-fortress for free metal?

I'd love to hear your input. It would also be amazing if Epic saw this, I can't imagine they haven't thought about this yet. I'd love to know what their design philosophy is, do they consider nades just cute early game items meant to be discarded? Surely they must see in their data how infrequently these items make it into the mid-late game.

PS: I know many of you will say you choose to carry stinks or nades, but my issue is that the true nature of the game disincentivizes you from actually carrying these items even if you want to. It isn't optimal in the least no matter how fun it is to shockwave to someone and shotgun them. I fucking love that grenade, and stinks too.",FortNiteBR

All of the weekly challenges are rather easy for me and many other players. Wins and eliminations are just numbers that go on my profile for nobody to see.

I think it would be a great idea to add a skin every season that progresses based on your eliminations or your wins, so that players have something difficult and actually challenging they can work towards during the season, especially when they've finished all of their challenges for a specific week and run out of things to do. 

It might look something like this:

* 100 Eliminations : Skin Style #1 Unlocked
* 250 Eliminations : Skin Style #2 Unlocked
* 500 Eliminations : Skin Style #3 Unlocked
* 1000 Eliminations : Skin Style #4 Unlocked

And possibly add in some different color variants of the progression skin for other challenges that get players to branch out and use weapons/items they might not be familiar with:

* 100 Sniper Rifle Kills : Green Skin Styles Unlocked
* 100 Explosive Weapon Kills : Red Skin Styles Unlocked
* 100 Trap Kills : Purple Skin Styles Unlocked
* 100 Fall Damage Kills : Blue Skin Styles Unlocked

I think this will be a cool way to keep players engaged throughout the season, allow them to earn skins that show off their skill, and add a little more variety and fun to the game.",FortNiteBR

I'll start. Personally I think season 5 was very unbalanced most weeks we would see an new smg which was overpowered or over abused their was roughly 4/5 poi which were never visited or fun to drop at.

For season 6 I would like a mystery/mystical theme like whiches, dragons and sorcerers so it matches the mystery of the cube a new poi I would like is maybe a castle on one of the hills or even a dungeon somewhere. New weapons I would like to see would be a new pistol maybe a burst pistol a new revolver but more poverful call it the heavy revolver and a semi auto AR like the M14 ",FortNiteBR

The theme is around an alien invasion. The cube will basically use the runes to set up portals for the other aliens to come through. The cube will boil the water and explode making the water toxic and leaving cubes shards. At the end of season 5 there will be multiple cubes around. Each where the rune is. 

As season 6 starts loot lake will become a  small wasteland of where the main cube exploded. The water will be green and the poi will have a creepy theme to it. As the weeks go on the cube will slowly take over the map taking control over all the characters. Brite bomber being first. Drift will be the final character left. He will nearly be taken over by them until the enforcers stop the cube. At the end of the season they have an epic battle. That’s as much as I know about the story for now.

But now let’s talk about the gameplay and the battlepass!
The battlepass will have some new skins but one of them will be the dark brite bomber. The final stage will be one of the aliens from the cube. That’s all I know about the battlepass. My roommate wouldn’t tell me more. It should have some other cube related skins though. 

The new gameplay feature should be the cube shards left over from Next weeks event. It will change your appearance when you use it. Your skin will have a purple glow and purple eyes with electricity coming off the skin. It will give you shield regeneration for 30 seconds. No fall damage and a speed boost. 

I don’t know much more than that unfortunately. My roommate won’t say much more about the season, but he did say that the Halloween event would also be pretty crazy. I’m pretty hyped for season 6. 
 This is going to be a great season! ",FortNiteBR

So I downloaded it did one game and died straight away I said to my son what is this game land and die. 

I said this game is absolutely %#£&amp; ill leave it so I never played October or November to get the Halloween skins I then played when 50/50 came out and didn't stop playing I have since been active every day.

Bought all the battlepasses hit almost max level each season and love the game

Just to think I always thought it would be a cartoon rip off of PUBG how wrong I was.

Its possibly the best game to come out in years.

I can never remember a game that I could play and enjoy as much considering ps1 and early pc days didn't even have Multiplayer. 

The only game to come close to having a laugh with mates was gta5 and that got boring doing the heist loads of times or the criminal mastermind once that's done so is the game. 


I know the game has its issues but as a whole I think we are all glad and happy with what epic has made it keeps millions entertained around the world. You make new friends it's made people a job from full-time streaming it. 

Can't wait to see what the next year holds in store for everyone as they mentioned in a previous video they are already working on S7/8 &amp; 9

464,2roK,1537102957,9gadpc,35,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9gadpc/why_bo4_wont_kill_fortnite/,5,Why BO4 won't kill Fortnite,"I hear a lot of voices these days that Fortnite is done for, CoD looks so much better, actually takes ""skill"" and is much more fun. Of course this is a load of horse shit and here is why:

**1. Same run and gun gameplay as the normal multiplayer COD

You die fast, I mean really fast. Basically someone can spray you down even from a distance and you'll drop dead without every knowing where the shot came from. 

While this suits the normal CoD multiplayer, with much smaller maps and instantly getting back into the action, it really is no fun in a BR game where you walk around for 15 minutes just to get gunned down without having a real fight.

**2. There is no counter.**

Unlike in Fortnite where you can throw down a building as soon as you get shot at open field and actually engage in a fight, in COD4 all you got is natural cover like a building or tree. Running open field in COD4 is dreadful, especially late game. You get shot at from all sides and there is literally nothing you can do.

**3. It's really campy.**

All of the above leads to 70% of the players in your lobby camping in a house somewhere. Whenever you approach a building mid to late game you can be 100% certain someone is sitting inside, preferably in the corner behind a door, waiting for you to come in and shoot you in the back

**4. Premium price for a tacked on mode**

Now, I gotta give credit to them, they did manage to create a BR mode in CoD with decent performance (but could be better). And I do admit when I first saw the trailers for the BR mode I thought ""damn this looks really fun"". However, once you play it, you realize other than Fortnite, this mode is just a ""mode"" and not the main game. If you are only looking to play COD 4 BR you'll be paying full price for just one game mode.

Basically if you didn't play PUBG over Fortnite so far, there is literally no reason to switch to CoD now. In fact you can argue it's a less fleshed out version of PUBG. Once you realize that, the only thing CoD 4 BR has going for it stuff like the grappling hook. However, once you've played with these gimmicks for a while the initial excitement wears off and you are still stuck with what is simply an inferior BR experience.",FortNiteBR

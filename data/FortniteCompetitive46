#1: No more heal offs (obviously)

This has been a plague of comp scene since the begging of squad scrims back in the double pump days. Heal offs are arguably the most rng aspect of the game because the person with most meds collected automatically wins which is annoying. No zone closing out means no damage needed to heal through.

#2: More kills endgame

In skirmishes what ends up happening is that a very detrimental number of people die to zone because they can't make it through the absurd amount of builds around them and of course all of them die when the zone closes completely. If at a certain point it doesn't pose a threat anymore it would force fights which imo is a step in the right direction.

#3: High ground would be key 

With glider redeploy in tc we have realized that high ground is very valuable and for a spectator battles for high ground is an exciting sight to see, however, players that manage to gain ultimate height still end it with healing. With my proposed solution we would see a huge battle for height at the end which would be quite intense and a feat of skill for sure.

#4: More room for intense CS:GO type clutches

Close quarters in any game always leave room for 1vN clutches because of peaking advantage and such. This change could have an outcome of insane moments to remember, imo these incredible moments make an export great i.e rocket league LAN finals 0 second goal to tie or one of the countless CS:GO clutches throughout the years

With all that said there are disadvantages 

#1: Nothing will push players to fight

#2: Explosives might be too strong

#3: [will fill in when I or someone else thinks of something to add]

What do you guys think? Is this too radical of a change to make sense or could this work? Imo there could at least be an LTM for it, thanks for reading :)",FortniteCompetitive
20,ALLST6R,1540991619,9sylm3,26,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9sylm3/leech_mode_to_prevent_heal_offs/,1,Leech mode to prevent heal offs,"**Tl;dr: when the circle closes, any damage dealt to opposing players HP is added to your own to encourage eliminations over heal offs in the closed circle**

So I'm seeing a lot of posts and comments recently since the Grand Finals about heal offs and preventing them. The way I see it, heal offs are a viable strategy due to the simple fact that you want to last as long in that storm as possible. That includes having maximum health, and avoiding all HP damage.

No matter what you do to healing in terms of limiting it at a certain point of nerfing their effects in final circles, there will always be an optimal point to activate meds in order to maximise your chances of survival in the storm. It will always lead to a heal off one way or another.

Having thought it over, I wonder if it would be viable to introduce a some sort of 'leech' mechanic to the game when the storm circle fully closes. **In short, any damage you deal to an opponent's HP once the storm has fully closed gets added to your own HP.** Essentially, it is a form of meds however, it incentivises eliminations as a constant stream of damage to opponents will keep your own health up and allow you to survive the storm. With the amount of damage you can deal, it be more effective than meds.

Strategically, it brings a lot IMO. You can be 30hp, no meds, but still slay out once the circle has closed and end up a victor.

It won't totally eliminate heal offs, but instead of the victor literally being determined by sitting and waiting to find out who dies last, players can go for that extra bit of damage which in turn produces actual gameplay until the last moment.

The same people complaining about them being uncontested at West World were the same people who were trash talking them for under performing in the first online tourneys w/o Moisty. I saw several threads saying Cloak and Tfue were just pub stompers and entertainers who aren't good against other pros. My argument against that of course was that they hadn't even scrimmed w/o Moisty and they were learning new loot areas and routes as they played in the tourneys and that we should give them time to get used to the new map. You can probably go back and find videos of them testing Lazy and other places. During the summer skirmish we saw Liquid perform wonderfully while they landed Wailing uncontested, yet no one said anything about it besides the one time they were purposely contested. That's where player integrity comes in, like when is it for your own chance to win and when is it just you trying to stop someone else from winning. Now we see FaZe land West World uncontested which they learned weeks after Moisty Mire was removed and people are salty. It seems as if people don't want to see them succeed. I also want to say that uncontested West World is not the main reason they won. I'm sure Fortnite is the first Battle Royale for most but not Cloak and Tfue. Both have competed in other major battle royales and have actual LAN experience. Most of the pros competing now are competing in a game for the very first time. IMO Cloak is also one of the smartest players there is, and that comes from his experience with H1 and PUBG, if he isn't the best then he is one of the best shot callers and decision makers in the game. I would say more but it seems I have already written an essay and submitted it to five different colleges.",FortniteCompetitive

31,Lucyfer2016,1540967900,9swbfe,16,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9swbfe/game_theory_to_see_if_players_should_contest/,1,Game Theory to see if players should contest Tfue/Cloak or not,"I think game theory helps understand how to make decisions on whether or not to contest Tfue/Cloak. I made a quick payoff matrix that is based on some assumptions. 

The assumptions are:
1) If both players(or teams) land Westworld, they both have a 10% chance of winning
2) If both players don't land Westworld, they both have a 20% chance of winning
3) If Player 1 goes to Westworld uncontested(Player 2 doesn't go), then P1 has a 30% of winning and P2 has a 20% chance of winning
4) (Same as 3, but switch the players). So, if P2 goes to Westworld unconested, he has a 30% of winning and P1 has a 20% chance of winning

The percentages don't really matter, what the percentage change means is what matters. So, in situation 1 they both go and the one who survived would leave with lower health/mats so he would have a lower chance of winning than maybe going to someplace else. But in situation 3/4, uncontested drops means you have extremely good loot so he has a higher perecentage to win. In situation 2, I'd assume that both players have an equal chance of winning if they both don't drop Westworld. 

So the matrix essentially would be(With Player 1's actions as the rows and Player 2's actions as the columns): 

----|Go|Don't Go
:--|:--|:--
Go| 10,10| 30,20
Don't Go| 20,30| 20,20

Based on game theory, there isn't a dominant strategy for either player. So, the best time to go to Westworld would be dependent on the other player's decisions. I don't know if this reveals anything new, but I think this means that if Tfue/Cloak consistently get challenged at Westworld then their strategy might have to adjust rather than just continuously taking the RNG fights. 

There's also another strategy which is for one player to randomize his drops, so that the other player have some uncertainity of whether or not to drop Westworld. This means that there are gonna be some times when the player will get an uncontested drop and some times when he does get contested. In the long run, this would maximize the amount of times someone would ""win"" (based on the assumptions I had above), depending on the percentages of how many times he gets contested/uncontested. 

I know this isn't an ideal situation because if Tfue decides not to drop to Westworld there are still other places that are gonna be contested, but I think the general idea of using game theory is still interesting thought. Love to hear some opinions on this (or changing up the assumptions).

I would like to challenge all players to look up other players on https://fortnitetracker.com/ to find out if they were actually a PC player or not if they are killed by someone they think was considerably better. This can remove imaginary bias that some console players have that they are only being clapped by PC players. I did this for a few of my games picking random names in the replay mode and found something very interesting - I only found a few players in searches (less than 1/10) that I looked up in 20+ point lobbies that were PC players.

I personally consider PC to be a superior platform to play on (I'm a PS4 player), but I think the skill gap is very narrow right now, so I think it’s a dumb excuse for console players to chalk up only dying because the other player was a ""PC god"". Sometimes a better player just killed you regardless of platform (this goes for PC players complaining about dying to console aim assist as well). 

This brings me to some questions I have - Why are there so few PC players in my lobbies? Is it because I'm a console player and the epic servers are not really making the tournament a fully integrated cross platform tourney? Or is it because console players significantly outnumber PC players?
If you are a PC player I would love to if you could look up some of the names in your tourney games to see the distribution of players and post your results.

from the title you already know what im going to talk about and you may say that you have heard about this controller vs k&amp;m thing a thousand times ... just read lol.
when we talk about best controller players we mention big names like : aydan &amp; nick. These 2 players are famous streamers, their life = playing fortnite. they spend more than 10 hours per day playing fortnite. And they have done well in tournaments against pc players. so basically epic said just because some of best controller players did well in tournament against pc players they have mixed lobbies ( pc + console + mobile ) which i considere it ""unfair"" step against controller players. you may disagree with me but just hear me out. have you ever sn a controller player won in any epic's tournament !! he may get high kills but im talking abt winning here ! of course you didnt. Why !! because controller players have limits ... but pc players dont have those limits. Epic did a great job when they've added an  insta build + separating building/combat sensitivity + customize ""Edit"" time they reduced the hige difference between k&amp;m N controller...but that's not enough. 
did u ask yourself : ""why Epic separated lobbies at the beginning of season 6"" !!! m&amp;k play against m&amp;k and controller Vs controller !!! do you think the majority of controller players will stand against a good pc player or ( m&amp;k player ) !! Of course no. and there are 2 things that controller player will never have : easy aim/tracking and easy switch between weapons. M&amp;k players have these two advantages. 
So im asking here ... why we can't have a  tournament only ""controller vs controller"" and ""M&amp;K vs M&amp;K"" !! Just because some ""few"" pro controller players did well do you think that more than 95% of us well do great against good/pro M&amp;K players. 
I considere my self a good fortnite player ( using controller ) good builder, good aiming , good positionning. And i do well against controller players but more than 70% i get rekt by a good M&amp;K player. 
I wish epic can separate lobbies in next tournament ""controller vs controller"" , ""M&amp;K vs M&amp;K"" and ""mobile vs mobile"" ... this would be fair",FortniteCompetitive

Everyone competing should be on the same playing field. This is going to hurt some of you, but If console players want to compete at pc tourneys than they shouldn’t be able to use an aim assist mechanic that’s exclusive to them. 

It’s like if they combined the paraplegic Olympics and the regular Olympics, but gave all the paraplegic contestants scoring advantages because naturally they are at a disadvantage. That wouldn’t be fair to the non paraplegics would it?

I feel like I learnt more from those three hours than I have from 6 months and 350 + wins in pubs. I was hesitant to play because I didn't want to be humiliated by better players and while I won 40% of my games, even getting 10 eliminations in one, I could really feel difference between these players and the ones in pubs.

I don't think I won any proper build battles and mostly lowground warriored/played smarter and thirdpartied. Playing against high level players will ultimately show weakness that you didn't even realise you had. For example I learnt that I need to start blocking off more, editing better and going up higher, as I often didn't establish enough stories of highground and it was constant back and forth because they could each me so quickly, burning mats and leaving no opportunities to cause damage. 

I also did not protect myself enough at the start which lead to lots of unnecessary damage, like getting shot by an at from a bad angle or someone dropping down and shotgunning me whilst I was unaware. Conversely it also taught me how to exploit every angle and damage even the most protected players turtling whilst minimisng their ability to shoot back. 

After the tournament I had 3 12 + lol games in a row and I finally understood why people call console lobbies bots. It felt like a completely different game. The contrast and just general difference in thought process between playing against these high vs low level players is insane. You can't improve playing pubs because you can't learn how maximise every situation to your advantage. Like in the tournament I'd have to make up a plan and think it up a sequence of moves just to damage someone, And when I came back I'd just like not even have to worry about what they were doing. 

Everyone who makes all these posts about improving 90s or game sense needs to understand it's all pointless without application,  And you won't apply it against pub players. Get in the practice tournaments, join fnpl scrims and get playing. Every single encounter against good players, as long as you can analyse a situation is an opportunity for massive improvement. Watch the replays from both perspectives and ask yourself questions constantly about how you could have optimised your gameplay or made a smarter play etc. 

I know I am going to play in every tournament from now on and I'm going to join as many scrims as I can. This is how to improve your game from good to great.",FortniteCompetitive

I very recently made the switch to playing fortnite on a pc roughly 2 months ago, so I have a decent amount of experience on both platforms. I’ve heard a lot of opinions from many pros lately, more specifically Symfuhny has made some comments recently about how console players shouldn’t be in PC tournament because of “console aimbot” (this may not be an exact quote just the general idea) and I have to say I heavily disagree with his opinion. 

Listen, there’s no denying that console players certainly have aim assist, and honestly compared to other Xbox games I’ve noticed the aim assist seems to be a little bit stronger. With that being said let’s also remember why console has aim assist... people are using only their thumb to try to precisely aim, a task which is far easier said than done. But if Symfuhny’s opinion that console players essentially have an aimbot is true, then why don’t we see far more console players competing at high levels? Why don’t we see console players consistently winning these events or placing much higher than PC players? You could argue that Nick and Aydan always place well and always get decent kills, but Nick and Aydan and the very TOP TIER of console and they play very aggressive for kills because they both understand that they don’t possess a lot of the late game preparation necessary to win these games. 

Now let’s highlight what advantages PC players have over Console players. PC players have the advantage of a much larger variety of keybinds, allowing PC players to have button layouts that can be more efficient than console players. PC players have a mouse, that is guided by almost every muscle in the arm and wrist, which allows for more consistent and quick aiming. PC still has better editing than console, even after the recent changes to controller editing and building. This list goes on guys, PC players have an advantage, even if it’s only slight, in nearly every aspect of the game. And again guys, I’ve spent a decent amount of time on both platforms, and from my experience playing on console is a much more difficult experience in terms of aiming, building, etc. 

So In conclusion, I really dislike seeing popular streamers chalking console players up to “aimbot”, it’s simply not true and I challenge any streamer that feels that way to play fortnite on a controller for a month and then come back and tell us if they still believe console has “aimbot”, I also think claims like this only hurt the community and act as a way to further divide console and pc players.

If anyone disagrees with my opinions please comment and let me know your opinion.

I noticed a trend of Epic utilizing LTMs to test game mechanisms.

With Disco Domination the clear mechanism test is respawns. 

Which got me thinking,

Respawns decrease the impact of dieing, and promote more aggressive plays and engagements. If Epic Incorporated a fixed # of respawns (one or two max), limited to the first two circles, do you believe this would increase early engagements while still maintaining the importance of placement?

In Skirmishes, 70% of the lobby is still alive come the third circle as most are looting and avoiding fights. Very few fights occur. 

Would allowing a respawns in early game promote fights, while still allowing all teams to compete for placement and maintaining the integrity of battle royales?

From my experience on the main sub, Twitch chats, and Youtube comment sections, there seems to be this innate bitterness towards the competitive scene. I constantly see these anti-competitive players complaining about other players building too much, push against Ranked mode, and the un-ironic use of “sweatys” and “try hards.” 

Now this wouldn’t necessarily have any cause for concern if it wasn’t as prominent as it has been as of late. I constantly see high voted comments on Reddit and Youtube videos on how the earlier seasons were better because not as many people built/tried. As well as the a large chunk of the main sub being against Ranked and trying to paint false narratives such as “smurfing will be a huge problem” or “ Ranked mode can’t work because there is too much RNG.” I’m not going to debunk these claims in this post because I’m sure that the majority of us all ready know that those aren’t valid arguments to begin with. 

I don’t want to throw around conspiracy theories but I feel like the majority of these players against the competitive scene simply don’t want Fortnite to move in a competitive direction because it will cause them to lose their “casual” game.  Of course this is completely based on anecdotal experiences through what I have personally seen. I just want to get a bit of a discussion going on this. ",FortniteCompetitive

I’m a bot that wants to become a god.

You pub stomp 10+ players every game, and I’m lucky if I survive my first encounter. 

We both hot drop greasy (I’m trying to get better), and you kill me immediately while simultaneously slow clapping. 

For me, it’s the main menu, loading screens, and waiting for the battle bus.

Meanwhile you’ve already killed 4 more players. You’re building, aiming, and shooting, while I’m just waiting. You’re getting reps and getting better. I’m not. How will I ever catch up and become competitive?***

…

Sure I can practice building in the playground, but it’s no substitute for a real build battle. And if you’re a below average player, it’s especially hard to improve mechanical gunplay unless you manage to find a dedicated practice partner with a similar skill level AND schedule. 

The other big battle royals that are releasing now – COD and Battlefield – all have traditional multiplayer modes where you can consistently get several reps (enemy player encounters) a minute due to smaller map sizes and respawns. Many more reps than FN BR, especially if you’re a player trying to improve. 

The thing that sets FN BR apart from other games is not the gunplay (who likes bloom?) or the format (BR has been done before). It’s the building. And the building can be applied to other modes – like smaller scale free-for-all with respawns or team deathmatch, without losing the focus on BR. It would be great for all players trying to improve to have a non-BR mode with skill-based matchmaking that maximizes reps, while replicating encounters that occur in BR. Epic is clearly thinking about respawns with Disco Domination, but it and other big-team modes don’t really replicate BR encounters. 

We all know that FN BR is tremendously successful, but with COD and BF hitting, this is an opportunity to spread the FNBR appeal to a wider market and make it even more accessible. When Epic took the underwhelming implementation of the original Fornite-the-base-builder/tower defender and applied the core mechanics to the trend of the day – battle royal – nobody had particularly high hopes. But look where we are now. I think these core mechanics can be expanded even further – and who knows what the results from that could be.

An idea that's been going around more and more is ingame incentives that could help a team win the game. It's the best way to keep this game a BR while also making midgame less slow.

I'll throw out a couple suggestions to get the ball rolling.

-	An instant spawn supply drop (doesn't fall from the sky) that could either contain great meds, materials or weapons. The quantity of items should differ between duos and solos.
-	The ability to see where one of the final circles will be maybe 30s-1m ahead in order to get a jump on other players for the rotation. (This one is my favourite, feels like it gives a great advantage whilst not really putting others at a disadvantage)

This is in regards to all the Daequan flack as well. Someone asked if Ninja was top 50 and I had this comment to say. Slightly edited from the original comment to fit the topic. 

I don’t know when you started playing Fortnite but Daequan, Myth and Ninja were some of the people who had a major impact on Fortnite in its early stage. Those players made me go buy a PS4(played console growing up and couldn’t afford a gaming pc at the time) back in January after watching them for a few months, just so I could try to do the nutty shit they were doing. Their early impact on the game was wild. Fortnite is really the only game I play and it started because of those players.

Sob story aside, I feel as if those players, as well as some earlier content creators/pros, were to constantly scrim, as well as pub stomp they’d be top 50 players. Are any of them currently? No. 

There’s a decent amount of fine detail that some of them lack apart from Myth(I think he’s going to start showing up, the way he wiped out that ghost squad was nuts), when it comes to the “competitive” side of Fortnite. When to rotate, when to contest or take high ground late game, can I take that fight mid game without getting third partied etc. You can’t really pick up those senses or improve those skills in pub games.

Battle royale though anything can happen and those players do have the quality and are capable of securing a win or doing extremely well at any given moment. Respect to all of their grinds as they choose different paths and have their reasons and intentions for doing things. 

Competitive Fortnite is lacking a little integrity though, and with invite only skirmishes you really can’t dictate who is the best but it’s still very early. 

TL;DR Ninja, Myth and Daequan and many others had a big impact on Fortnite in its early stage and have done a lot for Fortnite. Competitive Fortnite is lacking a little integrity and you can’t tell who is the best based off of invite only skirmishes. Those players are quality players but lack that mid-endgame quality(asides from Myth) to solidify themselves as top 50 players. Anything can happen in battle royale and those players can make shit happen at any given moment. Respect to the paths and grind they have chosen. ",FortniteCompetitive

Obviously in some cases the general consensus has proven to be right when pointing at a team like TSM but usually it proves to be incorrect.

So when looking at the newest case of ""this team is obviously bad because they did bad this one time"" circlejerk a team called ""Atlantis"" pops up. Having been hyped up as a favourite to contest best NA teams they kind of flopped in the grand finals racking up a few points only. Now every NA fan has come out of the woodworks screeching ""NA&gt;EU"" which does have some bases to it but imo shouldn't be a thing in a battle royale type games but thats not important, what is important is that atlantis is now a bad team all of the sudden. I cannot comprehend how thats even a discussion at this point, how can one bad performance outshine such fantastic players like mitr0, who has 4 summer skirmish wins under his belt, its completely baffling.

Whats even more exciting is that everyone saying that somehow forgets that poach, the posterboi of competitive NA fortnite, didn't even qualify with vivid, the other NA superstar. Or that chap and 72, also one of the best players in NA, didn't place top 12 either. How can this subreddit be so goddamn dyslexic sometimes.

Bus routes- I was thinking that bus routes would be the first place to start because they can completely cut down on rng in the following way. Let’s say the bus route cuts through pleasant and ends at paradise, There should be some way to estimate easily where the final storm circle should end up based on the bus route. In the bus route mentioned you could see where the bus route started and based off that you should be able guess the biggest contender for the storm circle would be at tilted. The reason for this is based off what Tfue and cloak said during the skirmish, they would drop to what they refer to as west world and never know where the storm would spawn and would end up either running the whole game or just waiting for everyone to rotate to them. This could also change how people play and add more strategy like would you want to drop right in the middle where the Strom circle would spawn or go all the way to the opposite end of the bus route and rotate in with the storm. The storms don’t have to spawn at the start of the bus route or middle but you should be able to estimate based off of the route.

Vending machines- vending machines I think could be the ultimate way to cut down on rng. When you play this game the main thing adding rng to the game is the fact that you drop in a house there is not a single weapon but your opponent who dropped next to you, got the best load out in the game gets a free elimination due to rng. I think there should be some 100% spots in which vending machines guarantee weapons and utility items of your choice and are always the same weapons or utility items and should spawn in sets of three similar to playgrounds. They should spawn all over the map also adding to whether you want to drop tilted and test your luck with chest and floor loot or drop some spot on the map harvest and get guaranteed items

Spawn rates- sometimes when you play there are situations you drop into a house and there isn’t a single chest, or you drop on your favorite spot with rift spawns nearby to find there isn’t a single rift. Basically what I’m saying here is that rift spawns, vehicles, and chest should all have a 100% spawn rate.

“Cheesy items”- this one is one of those controversial topics because it depends on opinion. items like grapples, maybe ice traps, port a forts and port a fortress shouldn’t be in the competitive game mode. The reason for these being removed is the change in play style is extremely big and “cheesy”, it doesn’t take much skill to just grapple up onto someone’s build then blast them with a double barrel, it gets rid of the fight for taking the high ground and the fun of fighting from low ground even if low ground in some situations is better. Same goes for the the port a forts anyone can pop those late game and there is a rng factor that’s comes in play, so not everyone can get one, unless they were in some utility vending machines 100%

Bloom- okay now this one is definitely the most controversial because it can come down as people are use to it now and it would be such a big change but bloom is a huge rng factor in any situation and we are better off with either no bloom or a recoil system.

Seasonal events/items- this is kind of like a opinion but personally I think map changes such as the corrupted zones, zero gravity, hop rocks, shadow stones and so on shouldn’t be in the competitive scene everything should be pretty vanilla maybe even the map itself.

That’s pretty much all I could think of if a competitive mode came out. I just wanted to get my word out so I don’t have any regrets and I can’t say I didn’t try. Let me know what you guys think. ",FortniteCompetitive

It’s really not that hard.

This doesn’t devalue launch pads, they’re used more like bouncers now to get out of bad situations that you need to glide high for, and is no different than when people used bouncers this way tbh.

Shockwaves have more value to me now imo, now you can bounce up high, and glide on demand.

It’s just so much better this way, if you get a bad drop in trump towers and rng fucks you, just jump out a window and glide to a open building.

I also saw someone say that it promotes skill. 

The main reason as to why I don't want this to stay, is that it's pretty much removing fall damage from the game. I've been in situations where I've been third partied by someone sitting on one ramp like ten stories high. Even if I shoot them down, they can fly away with no damage taken. I also don't actually think build fights are more fun now than they were before. Most people seem to fly away when they're put into the worse position. There's no punishment for doing stupid pushes or stuffing up your build and falling, because you can just fly away.

I also definitely don't think this change promotes skill. We could already build our way down from buildfights by turbo building walls down and catching yourself with a floor or ramp. This took a bit of skill, where as now, you just have to jump off, press the redeploy glider button and you're safe.

You shouldn’t be able to spam with smg’s on top of each other, without any risks, and no chance for the opponent to survive.  Also opens up for some new metas, instead of just the spam meta. And in my opinion it increases the skill gap cause it would be another thing a player had to control, and good players would master it.

I just wanted to bring to attention how op Westworld is at the moment. 

Right now you can get up to 18 chest spawns there, which is more than Pleasant (16),  Greasy (16), Paradise (15), and every other poi on the map besides Tilted and Retail. This doesn't make sense due to how big Westworld is compared to many other poi's. Most times in competitive play you can see 2 or more teams land at some of these bigger poi's and don't even end up fighting because they don't need to or they don't cross paths. At Westworld, it is inevitable that if more than one team lands there, they will end up fighting due to how small it is. Therefore many teams shy away from Westworld because they don't want to get into an engagement that early in the game and they know Tfue and Cloakzy will definitely be there. 

I know I will most likely get some hate from this post, but I just want to see the comp scene progress by getting rid of any landing spots that are giving players an advantage right of the start with something so crucial to the game such as loot. When I was watching the skirmish it just seemed kind of ridiculous how Tfue and Cloakzy ended up with crucial loot such as a rift to go every game. Even Courage and Lupo commented on it.

The SEA server they recently added are worthless. 90% of the time u cannot connect to them. I am able to connect once or twice in 2 hours to them. I am always redirected to the main server. (Yes i play during peak times)

We asians want epic  to make  a main server in singapore / Mumbai . If they can give centeral servers to NA who already get 60 ping , why cant we atleast get a main server which gives us below 100 ping.

I think we all know the routine.  Drop, make it through the HIgH SkiLl battles of early game, Loot, then Farm Materials.  You are finally looking good to rotate.  You might just have enough mats to fight off a fully loaded Grenade launcher, sweet.  Then, you realize there are only 25 player left.

Mid-game does need to be more exciting, however, the glider-redeployment isn't the only way to solve this.  In fact, many players spend too much time farming mats.  If players could farm mats faster, they could move on to the rotation phase much earlier.  Without the glider re-deploy feature, the storm would again become somewhat of a threat.   Players would have to rotate earlier, and so more interaction will happen earlier, on the fringes of the circle.  

This increase in farming rate is just one example.  The main intention of this post is to highlight that Epic drew attention to a problem, and also to point out that there are other ways to address this.  It might relate to mobility, and it might not.  ",FortniteCompetitive

2. Get a private invite before the survey went out. Register. Survive top 12 duos in your heat.

I believe that until we have a proper ranked format, or some type of ladder/bracket structure in the game, where players get matched against players at their own skill level, and THOSE top players get invited to events, then we haven't truly seen any sort of true pro scene.

I'm not discrediting the current ""pro"" players. I recognize many of them are talented and have great skill at the game.

Casters were awesome, game play was fantastic, and a lot of big names came up clutch. One thing that stood out to me though was the lack of game-time strategy and adaptation across the 6 games. Once Tfue and Cloakzy got a big lead, I kept expecting someone to contest them off the drop. If you are trailing those guys by 6 points and they are consistently making it to top 5 every single game, why not go westworld and make them fight for it? Especially if you are in second or third trying to make a push for first. The best chance you have of catching up to them is killing them early game, and you know exactly where they are going to land. Nobody did it, and shocker, they went into every mid-late game scenario completely kitted and performed very well.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand you have people contesting the dusty divot warehouses every single game and basically handicapping themselves from the start? Are people that set on landing spots that they can't make an adjustment on the fly? Makes no sense.

---

As we finish the final week of the Fall Skirmish Tournament, we would like to hear any and all feedback regarding these events. Please keep discussion based around the last week of the tournament. Include anything that you want to see changed, things that are good or bad, new suggestions they can have, etc... This can range from the casters, the format, the actual tournament, info and communication before the event, and all that plus more. 

&amp;#x200B;

By doing this, we can use the upvote system to measure feedback and also provide the developers with more information than simply, ""Hey, this is bad, can you fix? Thanks."" This also allows less clutter in our sub while being able to express some of the feedback you may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please keep all feedback constructive. Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it!

Honestly the mechanic itself isn't terrible but the implementation is. You should need to be much higher up to use it, think 7 stories instead of 3, it should have a cooldown so that people can't spam it, it shouldn't be useable if the building you're on is breaking, things like that.

As a PURE movement mechanic for getting across the map it's great, but now when some idiot thinks ""oh let me just stand on this one floor connected to one wall 10 stories high"" and I shoot him down, he's not punished for his poor decision making. The game needs to be punishing in some degree, not babied to a point that a monkey can play it, and without fall damage there's nothing punishing about it.

At this point not entirely sure where to go, I hope they revert the change but I doubt it, but we will see since this was just a test for a week.",FortniteCompetitive

Whenever people propose kill only based scoring formats there is always the complaint that it disregards the essence of a BR which is being the last player/team standing. But there is no complaint that players finishing as the 5th team alive receive points. Making achieving a victory royale more valuable (I was thinking 10 points) demonstrates the importance of winning in a BR, while also making playing solely for late game a riskier tactic, causing there to be more aggressively oriented play, but not totally disregarding the importance of winning on the results. I have always felt that pro matches should be closer to more skilled pub matches. The average player that is even decent at the game would feel unsatisfied with a 0 kill win (something we saw multiple times in the grand finals). Having the game closer to a pub game would only increase the comp scene's popularity amongst casuals as well. With decent enough RNG, there are so many people who could potentially finish second or third in a competitive match with no kills. Winning games takes significant skills and strategy in positioning and decision making and the amount of skill necessary to achieve a large amounts of kills in a stacked lobby speaks for itself. Let me know if there are any potential flaws in my thought process but like I said, I feel as if this change would more accurately represent the essence of a BR while also leading to more aggressive gameplay.",FortniteCompetitive

1.) Player's who lose high ground battles can now flee whenever.  In this situation, the high ground winner can proceed to shoot the player as they defenselessly fly away.  Should the high ground warrior follow the fleeing player, the fleeing player has now turned that tables without having to make any skillful play at all.  Since the fleeing player lands first, they have first action, whether shots or builds.  This turns the positions of power in the fight, without any outplaying being done.

\------- I also want to mention that, since players can fly away whenever, you have to give up high ground just to get the Loot.  This is a huge change.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Total air time among all players in games is much higher.  People are taking a lot of damage in the air.  I don't think this is any better than taking fall damage.  In fact, I think it is worse because you cant do anything about it.  Whereas, wall fall was a useful way to not take fall damage.

3.) Launch pads are not as valuable. 

4.)  Pyramid side jump can now lead to the player unintentionally pulling out their glider when done at the relevant height. 

5.) Rotation off POI's such as the new castle, and Viking Village, are too easy.  The rifts at these locations are excessive.  

6.) Grappler is more overpowered in conjunction with re-deploy.

7.) Fighting at race tracks is a bit hectic. 

8.) Probably the biggest of all, building high ground with not worries of fortification. 

\----- I personally believe having a solid foundation for your builds and being aware of it was a skill.

&amp;#x200B;

I and many other players have spent a long time practicing certain build patterns to do better in this game.  I feel as if this is making that practice go to waste.  Player's are also developing bad habits now that this test is going on.

The fan base of esports is very soft compared to real sports and seemingly can’t handle team banter 


Real sports organizations wouldn’t put up with antics that hurt their revenue meaning the nfl would never let you skip wearing a jersey as that’s one of their biggest money makers. 

If this was a real sport tfue would get fined every time he appears as a no skin. No sport would allow an athlete to encourage his fans not to buy merch. His no skin army is a direct contradiction to epics business plan. It’s such a childish response to being banned for clear tos violations. 


You would never have orgs playing with free agents in a real sport. There’s no organization to the duos or competitive scene as it is. Imo only teams should be able to enter a player, duo or squad not random pairs or squads. 


There’s no real governing body. The game developer can’t be the governing body needs to be a neutral third party

But I feel most pros, if not all, could do that easily if they focused their time on public high kill games rather than scrims.

I'm not here to say fuck Ninja because I don't dislike the guy like some people on here do, but I am seriously starting to get annoyed by his very presence in the Fortnite scene. Why? Because every where I look I hear about him. I see him on the recommendations tabs on youtube, see him on the news or on ESPN, I see him in commercials during NFL games, I see him on fucking Ellen (no, not really, I don't watch that show) but you get the point. And to be honest, this wouldn't bother me at all and I would completely respect his hustle if he actually played the damn game. This weekend he didn't even compete in the streamer tourney let alone the skirmish. He skips constant other skirmishes and has never once done a playground with any other top players (probably cause he is scared and knows he would get clapped even though most true competitive Fortnite fans don't care if you lose, just care that you compete and put the work in).

So with all that personal opinion nonsense aside, I wanna get back to the question and hope to have a real conversation here. Is he even a top 50 player in the world? Or even NA. That is not an exaggeration. Just think about it. There was a time when many Fortnite enthusiasts would question if he was one of the best player in the world. But after the summer and fall skirmishes, we have seen literally hundreds of ""pro"" and crazy mechanically sound fortnite players gain recognition who seem to take the game a lot more seriously. Better builders. Better decision makers. You name it.

So have at it, is Ninja even a top 50 player all things considered? To me, I think he could be a seriously good player if he didn't lose focus. If he worried more about skirmish placements and improving his game rather than sponsorships. What do you all think...",FortniteCompetitive

The only other ways for increased  mobility was completely RNG based (launch pads, rift spawns, etc). This mechanic is not RNG since everyone has it and does so many great things such as save mats, increase build-fights (which we ALL love), and end game mobility. I loved it when it was first introduced in 50's and the soaring solo's LTM was my favorite even in just the little time it was out. I would personally be sad to see it go, what are your thoughts?",FortniteCompetitive

I know I will get downvoted for it, but this is my attempt to compile a list of the tiers of fortnite players. Though I do think some players are better than others within each orgs, it is important to note that this is a BR and things change all the time.

Tier 1 (Can slay out and get good placements): Tfue, Poach, Cloak, Bizzle, Dmo, Saf, Vivid, Chap, 72Hrs, Nate Hill, Thwifo, Snood, Animal, LeNain, Aspect, and Zayt. 

Tier 2 (Slayers or Top placements): Sean, Aydan, Carose, Kenith, Xcells, Ceice, Kreo, Beesox, Blind, Ashton, Lanjok, Ghoul, Joseph, Anthony, Zoof, Zexrow, Kayuun, Kaysid, Daequan, Symfuhny, Tendons, Hogman, Kiwiface, General, Vicaros, Morgausse, Saint, TurkeyLips, Reverse2k, Funkbomb, Nox the Fox, Murksman, Sofa, Elevate, Jao, Tennp0 , and Heart

Tier 3 (Have shown glimpses but need to show more): 
Parallax, Daequan, Replays, Dafps, Thiefs, Typical, iHesi, Spacelyon, EmadGG, HighDistortion, Yelo, Tylarzz, PainfulPvP, Strafe, Punisher, Fuzzy301, Hysteria, Baldy, KingRichard, Ninja, and Courage. 

I dont want to put a tier 4 because its essentially putting down players at that point, but you get the idea. LET ME KNOW WHO I FORGOT, this is off the top of my head :)",FortniteCompetitive

With how well Nick and Ayden slayed out in previous matches this one match where Nick died to the storm bug could have been the match to get them that few more points so they can place higher. Nate Hill dying to the glider redeploy bug so early on in the game pretty much costed them any chance at getting major points.

Tfue owned in Heat 1, carrying to a win and hella kills. Cloak had the same or more kills then ANY OTHER TEAM in the tourney. He had 22, 2nd and 3rd had 22, and everyone else was under that. 

Ghost’s roster is incredible and it’s crazy to see Bizzle and Dmo clutch up like that. 

Ghost placing 4th,5th, 6th, 9th, and 12th is nutty as well. Saf and Ghoul popped off. Aydan and Nick’s showing was really fun to follow. 


Now, Liquid is still undoubtedly a top 3 team. Poach is specifically a low ground warrior and when he plays with Vivid he shortfalls a lot leading them to play low ground. With the new meta, that’s not gonna cut it so this weekend wasn’t a good showing for them. They’ll bounce back. I still think Poach is a top 3 player. 

Chap and Tom didn’t do anything crazy but they were consistent throughout the whole tournament. Respect to them. 


As for Atlantis, they were insane in the heats and failed to perform well in the finals. Doesn’t change that they are incredible players. Just a bad finals showing. Mitr0 and Magin contesting Saf and Ghoul for 5 games proved to hurt them a lot. They should’ve made the switch earlier. 

I don’t know how many people realized, but Nate and Funk switched drops halfway through the tourney. They usually land Fatal but were contested by Blind every time and were getting scuff loot. Then they adapted and started landing Snobby which ended up working out. 

Good showing of a tourney, as always things can be improved and we hope to see that soon. Courage and Lupo casting was incredible as usual. Whoever controls the spectator system needs to get replaced. 

That is all

- shoots rocket and then focuses and the guy in front, at minimum interrupting high ground’s heals.

 its spread out the map a lot better, which not only makes areas more viable but makes the midgame much less boring.

Games arent decided by which person gets the lucky last circles

High ground is as important IF not MORE important in scrims and buildfights

Its easier to counter-act people with explosives

Minigun is less oppresive

High kill games are much easier

Both aggresive and passive playstyles are rewarded

Downsides? :

people can disengage from buildfights

When the latest update first came out I was mad like many of you because they took out bunnyhopping, annoying zombies and they added in redeploying gliders which is possibly the biggest change

Before the update I had just started to get really good at build fights and edits so I was worried that build fights would disappear but they haven’t I have gotten into tons of build fights over this past week and the only thing that redeploying changes is that you need to try and box in the enemy faster if you have done some damage to them already so that they don’t fly away

Redeploying has also completely destroyed boring. Mid games because you can fly around the map super fast and find people so there is always action

Personally I hope epic keeps redeploying because if you give it a chance it is super fun

(I really miss bhopping tho and I hope it comes back)  

Thank you for making new and risky changes to the game so that it doesn’t become stale.

They created a very unique variety to BR by introducing building. It set them apart from every other BR game and creates a really unique game mechanic. Now they've got so much building and players using forts to protect themselves that they're having major issues with high player numbers and lag end game. Not to mention, what it seems like they perceive to be, a boring style of esport. It seems like every major change lately has been aimed towards reducing tunneling/turtling/camping and heal-offs (glider re-deploy, vaulting shockwaves/bounce pads etc. + more).

We know that Epic Games has said they want to make it open for anyone to qualify for, which got me thinking about a system that could work.

Each region would get 2 LAN events as qualifiers. Since right now, Epic has only run tournaments for NA &amp; EU, let's use them as the examples. The EU would have 2 LAN events, NA East would have 2 LAN events and the NA West would have 2 LAN events.

At each LAN event, Epic would invite 500 players. They would choose these players based on if they are signed to an organization, if they have placed well in the in-game tournaments, etc. This would mean there would be 3,000 players invited to these qualifiers. People would be informed of their acceptance to a qualifier a month in advance, and they'd be given the list of other players qualified for that specific LAN qualifier. They would have to choose a duos partner and a squad to play with, and since they'd have a month, they would have time to practice.

There would be a LAN qualifier each weekend, starting on Friday. Friday's would be solos, with 5 ""heats"" of 100 players. Each heat would be 6 games to hopefully better showcase the top contenders. The top 20 from each heat would advance to the Fortnite World Cup (meaning 100 solos from each LAN qualifier). The same process would repeat with duos on Saturdays (with the top 10 duos advancing) and squads on Sundays (with the top 5 squads advancing).

This would allow for the top solos players to emerge, the top duos to emerge and the top squads to emerge, rather than just having 500 players chosen, when some of those players may struggle in certain game modes.

After running all of the LAN qualifiers, you would have 600 solos players, 300 duos &amp; 150 squads who have advanced to the Fortnite World Cup.

The Fortnite World Cup could then have a series of events every few weeks. For example, a solos weekend would be similar to PAX, with the 600 solo players who qualified would play in one of the 6 heats over Saturday &amp; Sunday, with the top 100 participants advancing to Sunday's grand finals. Each event would give prize money to everyone who makes it to the grand finals, but it would also give them points based on where they finish the weekend.

After 3-5 solo tournaments, it would be clear who the top 100 solo players are. They would be invited to the World Championships, which would consist of 8 games a day, 24 total, to determine the final champion.

The same process would be repeated with duos &amp; squads.",FortniteCompetitive

#Changes

**Build Updates:**

- Cube Monsters and Spawners have been disabled
- Port-A-Fortress has been disabled
- Port-A-Fort has been disabled
- Shockwave grenade has been disabled
- Shadow post processing has been improved for better visibility

**Special Bonus**

- $10,000 will be awarded to the duo with the most combined eliminations during circles 3 and 4. During the match, admins will give indicators to when this phase is active
- If two or more duos are tied for the most eliminations during this special phase, the $10,000 bonus is withheld and rolled-over into the next match in the series.

- If a roll-over tie occurs in the final match of the heat, the current bonus is rolled-over into the first match of the grand finals. If a roll-over tie occurs in the final match of the grand finals, the current bonus is rolled-over into the existing $50,000 total elimination bonus

At a minimum, Epic should have a centralized page posted with heat times, contestants, scores, and rules. Finding a scoreboard should require little to no effort. They also have failed to spread information on contestants and rule sets out prior to tournaments which allows little time for promotion. Most of the time I’d be lost without the Google Doc sheets created by users of this sub. There are esports with significantly smaller followings that do far more promotion. Not sure how Epic doesn’t realize there’s a big demand for more information ",FortniteCompetitive

401,blazinghead,1540654934,9rv73r,41,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9rv73r/the_six_shooter_feels_a_bit_underwhelming/,1,The six shooter feels a bit underwhelming compared to the other weapon combos.,"Don't get me wrong it's a major improvement from the revolver and its really nice and unique but I have a suggestion to make it a tad better as far as weapon combos go.

So below are the reload times of some pistols and the smg.

* Green pistol: Reload 1.5 - Dps 162

* Purple suppressed pistol: Reload 1.3 - Dps 189

* Purple six shooter: Reload 2.19 - Dps 190

* Green smg: Reload 2.31 - Dps 216


So I've put the green smg just because you wouldn't possibly trade it for any kind of pistol or the six shooter for any reason.

My suggestion is either:
1) Reduce by 0.2 or 0.3 the reload time of the six shooter in all variations so it becomes viable enough as a smg replacement or

2) Make the reload time static at like 2.4 seconds and make the reload mechanic similar to the shotguns with each bullet reload time be the 1/6 of total reload time (0.4s) and be able to stop the reload at each point to shoot.


What do you guys think about that? I think that it could be a viable off meta alternative to the usual combos we have now. ",FortniteCompetitive

When I hold down left click, switch to my ramp/wall wtvr. and then release left click quickly after switching, my object actually doesn't place. I need to hold down left click an estimated half a second after switching for my build before the object places. Is this something that's normal and I just never noticed or is this like the turbo build bug in the past that the first piece just doesn't place after quickly switching to turbo build?

8. Ammo can be obtained by starting the shooting minigame.

Notes:

Use grapplers to quickly retrieve the materials on the floor and travel to your fight location.

Position fight locations a little away from the respawn locations.

Do not RPG the vending machines or all metal will despawn.

Cube Monsters: Only drop Ammo/mats (ammounts vary on size) eg: small zombie gives 15 wood or 10 brick or 5 metal, big zombie gives 30 wood or 20 brick or 10 metal, etc. Similar with ammo. Also keep the shield from killing the zombies.

Redployable Glider: Make it have an animation/buffer for around 3 secs, and make it have limited uses that you can gain from killing people. eg: Has 3/3 uses left kills someone now has 4/3 used. Kinda like an overcharge same goes for if 2/3 would go to 3/3.

Disco roof gives me high ground if anyone else decides to land in the area and having somebody land even 1 second earlier than you can end the match. Yellow drops will leave you hanging over the roof for about 2 seconds, green drops will put you perfectly on the guns with zero air time.

Since the Fortnitemares update I've noticed I'm running into way less high skilled players throughout a match. In a normal duo game, there's maybe one other team we run into that can even hit shotgun shots in a build fight. There's plenty of people building, but there just doesn't seem to be as many solid teams, especially in the end game. It seems almost every match the last team or the last single guy can barely build a 1x1.

Why is this? Are all the good players dying early or something? Am I just on a string of lucky days and bad lobbies? I'm a solid player, but we don't normally stomp through almost every lobby like this.",FortniteCompetitive

And that opponents never run the risk of falling damage as well.

If you changed the glider deploy height to 6 stories, enemies would run the risk from 3-6 stories high of taking that fall damage. 

I think changing the deploy height addresses both trains of thought, more mobility, easier escapes/ more offensive and defensive plays..  but also still has the risk of what building up high creates.

TLDR give us risk/reward by changing deploy height to 6 stories high ",FortniteCompetitive

We hardly ever get to actually see real fights between good players. Just spraying walls and hoping you don't get third partied.

This will not change as long as placements are worth points. Why? Well because it's much safer and easier to tunnel until your in 1st-10th place than it is to kill pros. But that's what we want to see isn't it? Pros out building, out smarting, and out playing each other?

The only way to do that is to remove points from all placements except first place and to make each kill worth a point.

Why each kill worth one point? Because it makes absolutely no sense to have 2-3 kills = x points. Do I need to explain why 3 is better than 2? No. 

Why first place being the only position worth points? Because it still has to have some resemblance of an actual pub game. Have it worth 3 or 5 points for a victory. Or maybe even a 2x's multiplier to your kill count. 

These two changes combined together force pros to go for high kill games and eliminates the urge to tunnel. 

Tunneling may still happen BUT only by players with enough kills to actually afford to tunnel and strive for that multiplier. 

I really can't see professional fortnite continueing to have an audience when the pro games arent the skills we want to see tested. When I watch poach stream, I watch him out building, out aiming, and outsmarting pub players. I think to myself ""man I'd love to see all those skills tested against another pro"" not ""man I'd love to see him sit in a box and hope he doesn't get shot in the back!""",FortniteCompetitive

**Kill incentive needs to be increased even further.**

If you compare heat 1 and heat 2 what you get is basically two groups of people that are as different from each other playstyle wise as you can possibly get in Fortnite. I assume tomorrows games will be more in the middle compared to todays games. Atleast they probably won't be as defensive as the games in heat number two was.

My opinion is, you just can't have games where there are 70-whatever players left in the final stages of the game. It creates an envoirment nobody enjoys, with tons of RNG, tons of lag, and no one can say that they actually 100% won that game fair and square. Nobody can say that they've practiced so much on how to handle lag and 70 other people rotating that they've finally mastered it. It goes against everything this game should be. And last but not least, how awful it is for everyone, both Fortnite as a competitive game, the pros that are playing and the fans that are watching that so many players die simply because of lag. 

Also, let me ask you, what games did you enjoy more? Feel free to tell me in the comments.

**The idea I would like to suggest is to split the prize money in two**; 
- 50% goes to the people with the most kills (some amount pr. game, bigger amount for highest total) - 50% goes to the people with highest placement (some amount pr. game won, bigger amount for highest average placement).

This way competitive Fortnite will hopefully see an increase in action overall, which leads to less people in the late game, which again leads to less RNG and less lag.",FortniteCompetitive

I think the main reason they didnt qualify is their clashing playstyles. Vivid has always excelled when sitting up top firing down on players while poach likes to be ultimate low and catching people with edit peaks. They didnt contest high ground nearly as much as they should have, and with the new glider redeploy, high ground means free rotations while wasting mats because you cant die from being shot down. That being said, RNG obviously plays a huge part of this. Poach tends to get too comfortable doing the same old thing (containers rotate) and gets really panicy, or at least anxious when tagged for a small amount of shield. Making a high ground play is likely gonna cost a few minis but it is worth with the new patch. I know Poach loves his low ground, but in these tournaments, its a clusterfuck down there that only works if you have a ton of mats. Being high ground and using the gliders helps you conserve mats much easier. Wish they had contested high ground and played more agressive but oh well :(",FortniteCompetitive

Heck, even I was surprised, I was rooting for them also. However, digging deeper into their stats as duo players it becomes quite evident, duos isn't their strong suit. I have compiled data for every skirmish week, summer and fall, and given point values to people, and have shown team and player stats for solos and duos. Link will be below. However, Poach and Vivid are strong solo players, and that is where they excel, together, as a duo, they don't have great past results. Aside from the 1 week in the Summer Skirmish they won, they never placed. When players duo, they should be able to be better than the combined solo talent of each player. Tom and Chap are a great example of this. Vivid and Poach haven't played with each other as long as these other people, which could be a reason as to why they haven't hit the jackpot in terms of complimenting each other's skill. So for it shouldn't be too much of a surprise as to why Poach and Vivid didn't make grand finals, even though it was a heartbreak for me.

Again he's at the top of yet another tournament. I would argue this one is less significant than the other 2 where it was solos but still important nonetheless. I've watched and enjoy anyone winning these tournaments (Liquid, Ghost, Faze, etc...) so I'm not necessarily biased in terms of picking a person but I think he deserves it. Nerves of steel, never rattled, always with 40k to 50k viewers on his back, sick or healthy this dude kills it. Even though I've watched him scrim a day before major events and questioned his performance he always knows what to do come crunch time. Liking him doesn't matter when it comes to evaluating his skill level so before you go on a rant, just know this won't affect the argument put in place. Consistency wise, you could argue of course, but I would still give him the edge when picking the current best player in the game right now.",FortniteCompetitive

I really like all the new content and patch notes that Epic is showing in the game but its destroying my game speculations. I know the FPS drops are because of Fortnite because of all the other reddit posts and i have a good pc ( i can play every other big game but Fortnite and i play on low everything) i play native res because fullscreen gives me more fps and believe me i tried 1080x1080 and everything but its not boosting my fps anymore so native will do. I see streamers having fps drops of 50 fps and i just feel like Epic’s making Fortnite too big of a game. Is it the Fortnitemares update? Is it my pc? Do you guys have this fps problem? Do you guys have a solution for this problem? Im really just posting this because its almost becoming unplayable for me and im curious if you’re also having these problems.,FortniteCompetitive

Then I realized the difference between my old playstyle and my new. In the past I played like a scrim player. Every single match I would make the best decisions, take no unnecessary fights, play passive, etc. I would watch tfue and cloak play scrims and tournaments all the time. 

 it seems like ima have to go back to that. My mechanical skill is definitely way better than before, it seems I’m not playing how I used to because I already know I can “win a game” so I started trying to rely on just killing ppl to win games, rather than IQ.  

Old me that was my strongest point, IQ. Now the new me is all just “building god”, which doesn’t do me much when parties come. also, the new me is never scared, so I have confidence to kill ppl, but that doesn’t mean I actually will lol. Also winning because of IQ, and winning because of high kills, honestly I had more satisfaction winning because I was way smarter than the ppl in the game. 

Now that I have great building and aim, I should I actually combine that with IQ.. Before I was pretty good at all 3, my IQ seems to have completely left lmao. I would go into situations where i am one shot and try to pump the guy in the head for a clutch. Then I hit them for like 80 and they kill me. I was relying on gun skill, and building. But I have been raging Too much, gotta stop playing like reckless.

With the help of u/xdonny's stats I was able to calculate who would have won each skirmish had this been the format (entirely for fun), although I was unable to copy and paste the data which means I only have the top 10 standings for each skirmish and there may be some mistakes.

Note that while I kept the 5 point bonus at 8 kills for duo tournaments, I made the bonus for solo tournaments activate for 7 kill+ games, as epic's point systems would generally suggest.

I'm not a massive fan of the format, which barely rewards placement beyond first place and is no reward for consistency but it is still, really interesting to see what  would have happened. There are an awful lot of very interesting results.",FortniteCompetitive

Back when I played console, I’d have weeks where I’d win like 6-8 solos a day, and then I’d have weeks where I could barely scrape up 1 win a day. I thought it was because I couldn’t aim well consistently on console so I figured I should switch to PC and that would fix my issue since aiming with a mouse is much more precise and it gives you more control than aiming with joysticks does. I was wrong. Because the way I see it now, consistency has more to do with your mental than it does your mechanical skill. I’ve notice that when I play to my highest level, I’m a lot more focused. I feel like I’m in control of every fight, and I play with confidence. When I’m on a losing streak, I feel anxious and I play a lot more passive. I typically get outbuild and take damage at the beginning of fights and end up trying to turtle rather than playing aggressive. The reason I lack consistency is because I personally can’t control the way I feel when I’m playing. I can’t control when I get anxious during fights, because for me it just happens. After getting killed over and over again, while having such high expectations for yourself, it does damage to your self esteem. You feel less confident, so you play with less energy. I guess the solution is to just to be in control of your emotions. Feel confident consistently. Not sure if I’m thinking of this shit too deep, but I’ve just noticed that I never play to a high level when I’m not feeling well. I figured there were probably several others with this issue so I thought it’d be worth making a post. ",FortniteCompetitive

He plays on OCE servers as well which I'm sure anyone from here is aware that games can get very sweaty, especially at night lol.

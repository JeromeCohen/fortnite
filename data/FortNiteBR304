I’ve been playing since December, had a rough time getting used to the game, but i steadily got better. Took 600 games between my first and second solo victories. Now I’d say I’m a decent builder and I can win fights. But the last month or two it seems like people are on roids; I find myself thinking things like “how can they track me and hit every shot up close?” and “there is no way that’s a controller...”

I’ll stay and spectate and watch them build and it’s like their sensitivity is super high, but how can a high sense even be viable in shotgun fights on a controller? I’ve played around with my sensitivity a bunch of times from low to high, and I just can’t get the right feel for it where I can do the jumping and the aiming and the shooting but still build.

My main thing is just, how are people able to fight effectively in CQB with high sensitivity with a controller? If i have mine anywhere above like 6.5 i overcompensate and miss them every time. Yet some dude just runs up and does 360 spins and backflips and can still chunk me hitting crits every time.

I think there would be MORE people camping. When your materials are limited you will not be comfortable taking buildfights, so making a 1x1 and chilling is much safer, and much more resource efficient. Less materials will not promote agressive play, it will promote camping. Like what do you do in the current gane when you are low on mats? - You turtle, and try to use the resources you have left as efficient as possible, i.e. camping. Of course you could try to go for a kill to regain resources, but that's not viable unless you are playing casual matches for obvious reasons.",FortNiteBR

What if epic made it so you can only carry 1 shotgun? 

I know the majority would probably just go pump, smg but I cannot see as many people doing that as how many currently run double shotty. I personally love to run a blue tac as my only shotgun (if I find one) then take C4/ grenades as utility.

Not the way to go.,"In the last few months Epic has been slowing down the pace of Fortnite with editing being slower, shotgun meta has been flipped on its head and you better farm for the first 2 circles to get enough to make it through the end game.

All this to make the game easier for the newer players while slowing and tripping up the good ones. This game is unique and we love the way you utilize your skill in not only pointing and shooting. But a few more steps in the current direction and we wont be able to have the iconic proper building fights anymore.


A fight among 2 good players can spend 1000-1400 mats between them to get the crucial upperhand. Explosives are not a issue here. Its never been an issue. There are ways to play around with the building mechanic.


For new players it should be hard. Because thats what keep you going. You want to master it. When i started playing i got destroyed like there was no tomorrow but i want to keep going because i wanted to do what the better players did. I couldnt sleep when builder pro was released. I had to get up out of bed and master it. 

The players you are trying to cater to are the ones who dont dedicate time, uninspired people who arent willing to put the time in wont stick around for you. They will dip out for the next AAA release.

I have improved a lot lately and get to the end fight, i usually like to carry AR SG HSG Shield Sniper, but as i got more and more to the end and losing games i noticed it was always to RPGS, i also noticed the play styles at the end of people carrying them, people will camp in their box and wait for others to fight, once they do they usually fire over an RPG, this changes the game massively, it then stops people rushing them because they are already camped in and just shoot you with rockets, so it becomes hard to rush, even if you double ramp wall and get to them they just build up and fire an RPG down to you, it takes minimal skill, a lot of people are very reckless with them and will shoot you even if it means at time hurting or even killing themselves.

RPGS were probably meant to be in this game to help take down bases, but lets be honest, they are hardly used like that, there is a lot of streamers now who carry one shotgun and the RPG instead of the other shotgun they were carrying, they ramp up and shoot down an RPG, do not even have to aim that well.

IMO this is a massive issue in the game, i am all about skill and gun fights, i know people will say it is a skill in its self to be able to fight people with RPGS and build to avoid and i can also agree with that, but i think overall its a very cheap tactic and a massive reason why the the end game slows down so much and why people camp a lot.

But judging by the comments in the stickied thread, I’m sure there are others who feel like me, and I know the devs are reading, so I wanted to say something. 

For a multiplayer online game to be successful in the long run, tactical approaches have to have exploitable weaknesses that can be exploited to balance out their strengths. In English: you need balance for people to have fun. Imagine if shotguns were the only viable weapon in Counter Strike. Imagine if Ret Paladins were the only viable PvP class in World of Warcraft. Maybe some of you remember when spamming vertical strikes with Raphael was a dominant strategy in Soul Calibur II. When imbalances like these occur, developers should try to correct them and achieve balance between different play styles. The reason they do this is because if you limit the viable play styles in your game, you limit your audience. Not everyone wants to play the game in the exact same way - and that’s fine! The richness of the best multiplayer games comes from having multiple different ways to approach an encounter. I believe this is what Epic is trying to say with its recent comments. 

Of course, games have essential elements that define their character and that you can’t remove. Building is one of those elements in Fortnite. The ability to alter the landscape gives scope for greater creativity in gameplay than in a standard shooter, and that is a great thing. It's part of what makes Fortnite so compelling. It also crucially creates the opportunity for tactical counterplay. In another shooter, getting jumped while in open space would be a death sentence. In Fortnite, you can defend yourself and give yourself a chance to make a play.

So the problem isn’t that there is building in Fortnite (and I really don’t think the devs think that is a problem either). The problem is that right now, in Fortnite, building is a *dominant* tactical strategy. If you get into an engagement and someone wants to build push you, unless you build back at them and win the build fight you’re at an almost insurmountable disadvantage. It doesn’t matter how good you are at positioning or aim - if you’re stuck on the ground while your opponent has built above you, you’re going to get dunked on. And the problem with this is that it turns a lot of people off. Fortnite has a huge audience, but there are loads of people out there who don’t want to play it because they feel their play style isn’t viable. You can see this easily by the number of people who try the game a few times and then give up, saying “I don’t like the building.”

I personally don’t think the solution is to have a “no building” mode like some people are suggesting. I think it’s fair to ask people that they master your game’s core mechanics in order to do well, and I think building is a core mechanic of Fortnite. But I think the people who give the game a try and end up saying ""I don't like building"" are hitting on something: skill is an arms race, and right now building is a nuke without much of a counter besides *more* building. Much of the current player base on this sub has been around for so long and has mastered building to such an extent that it’s not fun for newbies. We’ve all seen videos pop up from the game’s release where two players will fight it out for the win without building. We laugh at how no one used to know how to build. But that’s exactly the ground that a new player coming into this game is able to play on. It shows us how far we’ve come in the time since, how far the arms race has moved on. With building occupying the tactical high ground that it does now, that’s the gap that a new player has to overcome to be successful. Frankly, it’s discouraging, and it turns a lot of people off.

Again, I don’t think building should go away, and I don’t think Epic is saying that either. I think what they’re saying is that they don’t want people who are less skilled at building getting dunked on *quite* as badly as they are now. If you’re a great shot, you should be able to win some engagements on your aim. If you’re great at positioning, you should be able to claim the tactical high ground without necessarily being able to build a fortress in 3 seconds. If you and an opponent build up to each other, you should be able to win that engagement with great gunplay and not just a command of building vertically.

I can think of a few ways of doing this. Maybe it involves reducing material caps. Maybe it involves making building slower. Maybe it involves some bullet penetration of built structures. Maybe it involves making explosives more effective. I don’t know, I’m not going to pretend I’m a game dev. It's Epic's job to find what works, based on our feedback.

**TL;DR** - My only point is that tactical balance is important in multiplayer games, and tactics in this game overwhelmingly favour quick building. I think Epic have correctly identified this issue and have been working on it for quite some time now. They’ve been incredibly responsive to this community so far, so I think there’s a role for all of us in providing feedback to them in how they do that going forward.

It's similar in Duo's and Squads, but generally the bases are a little bigger. The same problem however, still exists.

Unless you arrive at the final circle with 500+ Materials, it's really hard and sometimes almost impossible to put yourself in a position where you can challenge them successfully. You pretty much always have to have C4 or a full stock of Rockets.

When I read EPIC's latest post about changing the way materials are in the game, I thought about how they could possibly combat the 'turtling meta'. I don't know if this is something they are trying to combat with these changes, but it seems to be a real problem, and I'm not sure that redcing the cap would solve it.

For anyone who doesn't know, the 'Turtling Meta' is basically describing people who will hold back on the aggression to try and get further/win the game. This usually means sitting in a Fort until late in the game. In the Comp scene, this involves trying to out-heal other teams after the final circle has closed.

So, what about if you gave materials an 'expiration time'. The time taken for the materials to expire, should be relative to the type of Material, and the timing of the circle.

For example, using Metal in Early game would last the longest. Using wood in the final circle would only last 20-30 seconds. 

This would force players to only use materials for cover, and encourage fights (be it ground level or by using the building mechanic).

Now to preface this, I want to say that I’ve been playing since December of last year. I got my first win in February and consider myself about average for the player base involved in the subreddit and slightly above average for the whole Fortnite player base. [Fortnite Tracker profile.](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/ArktickWolfie) I mostly play on Playstation but I have played it on every available system except for Switch. I tell you this so you know I care about this game and want it to go in a good direction and last a long time!

Now for the actual discussion; What is a healthy way to reward players for wins but is worth it for us and doesn’t take a lot of money away from EPIC so they don’t just shoot it down immediately. 

**Overview**

1. 10-25 V-Bucks (Solos only) 

2. Battle Stars (5 for Solo, 3 for Duos, 1 for Squads)

3. 500 xp (Solos) / 250 xp (Duos) / 100 xp (Squads) 

Earning V-Bucks should be limited and not available for every win. This prevents people from abusing the system and teaming up to win every game. This also prevents big streamers (who probably make up a decent amount of EPICs vb revenue) from winning a thousand something vb every day. (This obviously would be tweaked by EPIC; they may decide 5 credible wins a day is a better balance for example) 


**Breakdown**

1. 10-25 V-Bucks (Solos only)

I tried to leave some wiggle room w/the 10-25; My reasoning for this is that I want a decent amount to reward players for winning but I didn’t want a huge amount that would scare EPIC, they are a business and are here to make money. 

What if it was 10 base V-Bucks for a win, but every 10 kills (or so, numbers would need to be tweaked) get a multiplier on the base reward (The 10 V-Bucks) So 10 kills would double your reward, netting you 20 V-bucks, 20 kills would triple the original giving you 30! 

This is important because if you’re limited to earning it would push for more competitive, high kill game play so that players could earn a bigger payout for their one rewarded win a day.

This could be manipulated by EPIC Games until they find their sweet spot.

Personally, I’d break it down into smaller, more rewarding increments, as follows:


1 Victory Royale = 10 V-Bucks

And then additional V-Bucks per kill in increments such as:

5-9 Kills: +5 V-Bucks
10-14: +10 V-Bucks 
15-19: +15 V-Bucks 

... And on and on. 

These would not stack. 

If you get 9 kills you’re awarded 15 V-Bucks. 

If you got 11, you’d get 20. 


Another option: 25 vb per win, limited at 5 wins. This option ensures players a solid 100 vb possible a day but I can see several problems with this.

The first is that it promotes campy gameplay over aggressiveness which does not seem to be the direction epic wants to go. 

It also promotes teaming. Players who do not have what it takes to win on their own will queue with friends in attempts to land in the same lobby and team up and share wins. There really is no fix for this in general without Epic cracking down and banning those who are caught teaming. 

I’m not a fan of this option, but it is more rewarding vb wise for players who can pull off multiple wins a day. 


Now, what we all want for our wins really is just vb (w/out the inclusion of some sort of ticket system where they create a specific token to reward wins that has its own special function) but that’s how Epic makes most of its money so we’re gonna have to accept that our vb rewards should be limited and look at other options.


2. Battle Stars (amount based on game mode)

Imagine if you got half a tier every time you won a game. For players like me, this would be a solid boost to finishing the season with time to spare. At level 72, and 7/8 weeks of challenges done, I’m at tier 93 and will probably be done once I get a chance to complete this weeks challenges. Obviously I’ll finish this season with plenty of time to spare, but the quicker I get done with the tiers the more xp I earn and the quicker I get to level 80/100/whatever your goal is.

3. Boosted XP. 

A boost to xp for wins could work in several ways; it could be a flat amount of experience for winning, for  example - win a Solos game and earn 500 xp/250 for a Duos/ 150 for a Squads.

I went with a higher amount for solos because the odds of you lucking into a win (I.e. playing fill and getting 3 A1 teammates who carry you to a win ) is lower. However, I know a lot of highly skilled players play solo squads so maybe you get more based on many team members you have (in total out of 4, not alive out of 4.) So if you Squads no-fill by yourself and win a game, you’d get 150 times 4, since you’re acting as all 4 team members. This would reward the effort put into to winning a solo squad game by yourself.

Now, another option is to give a temporary xp boost to your following matches after a win. If I win match #3 of the day, then the next match I get a x2 xp boost for match number 4 or perhaps the whole day. 

I like it for just the next match, but if you win that match as well, you’ve now got a x4 multiplier for your next game. 


**Conclusion** 

Points 2 &amp; 3 might seem pointless to you because 


a) We get plenty of battle pass stars from weekly challenges. 

b) xp over v-bucks? Doo doo

But, if we have a limited amount of wins per day that we can win V-Bucks for, and there’s additional vb awarded for really good games, what if you win a solo game with only 3 kills? Would you rather take the 10 vb that win nets you, or opt in for a bonus 5 battle Stars and try to get a higher kill win that will be a bigger payout? 

[**TL;DR:**](https://youtu.be/CqCCBohjaqA)

1.	10-25 V-Bucks (Solos Only - Limited amount of “credible” wins per day; additional vb earned per kill to promote aggressive game play over camping)


2.	5 to 1 Battle Stars ((Solos/Duos/Squads) With either: a limited amount to be earned per day, per game type and/or change the amount per game type, for example; 5 Battle Stars for a solo win up to 50 Battle Stars earned a day) 


3.	500 xp (Solos) / 250xp (Duos) / 100x (Squads) ((Withs multiplier on Duos/Squads for playing with no teammates to reward solo squad/duos))

I will post a comment later with my thoughts on a potential token reward system for things such as exclusive cosmetic items or winners only exhibition matches.

While I do agree with everyone saying that building is the key element of the game, at the same time I don't understand their outcry.

**Resource caps:**
Epic mentioned resource caps in their post, which seems to be a religious sin to some players. But I do actually think this could be a good change. First of all everyone is ranting about the material gain. Why do we have to farm for 5-10 minutes straight at the beginning of the game? Because everyone else will have like 1000 mats and you just have to have the same amount. As a good builder I feel uncomfortable without at least 700 wood plus some brick or metal. But just because I know my next opponent could have a similar amount and I most probably I need that amount for being able to pull off at least two fights. 

When resources are capped to let's say 500 each BUT you'll have increased resource gain, that means two things:
First you have to farm far less materials to compete with opponents and you gain your max value of mats way faster after a fight.
Second you have to actually think about what you build and cannot turbo build 1000 mats and still have 1000 in reserve. You have to build smart and not only turbo build like a hamster on crack. Also turtling will be nerfed by this, which is a good thing too, because it's becoming really annoying these days.


**Weapon balance/shotguns:**
What exactly is wrong about this? Who wants to truthfully tell me that there exists anything other than shotguns in the current state of the game? Who wants to tell me that double shotgun is not the go to/must have setup?
The weapon balance in Fortnite is average at best right now. Epic is right when they say that shotgun-buildfights should not be the only viable playstyle. I have 2000+ games and 500+ wins total on console and pc and I'm getting tired of building towards my opponents, shotgunning them and then going on. The weapon arsenal of Fortnite is huge, maybe the biggest of all br's and the possibilities with traps and nades are even bigger, so why should we all be forced to only play shotgun build-offs? Why should I not be able to do all? Shotgunning, AR fights, snipe fights and explosive throwing depending on the situation and everything is useful, equally effective and makes fun? Why should I be forced to not even pick pistols up most of the time, because they are nothing compared to shotguns at close range?

They didn't even say that shotguns will be nerfed even more, which I - to be clear - hardly disagree with. But there are certain things that need to change: double shotgunning should not be a thing anymore. It should come with a clear downside other than ""you have to sacrifice an item slot though"". Ar's need a serious buff or rework at this point. I think we need to get rid of bloom and implement recoil patterns, to finally make them viable again. At this point everyone know's how to build cover, so you should at least be able to hit your shots when you fire at someone and your crosshair is on them constantly.
IF double shotgunning is fixed somehow (I don't have a final solution here), the pump shotgun should get rid of the swap delay, to make it more viable again. 


So let's be real here. FSA was added and half the community lost their shit, because you could now laser people across half the map. Overreaction. Nothing happened, nobody complains about it now.
The weapon swap delay was added and a huge shitstorm was going on and people claimed the game would die soon and all this shit. Nobody even cares right now. Floor loot materials and chest materials + Llamas got a nerf, which also scared me at first. But when you actually feel the difference, that only tells me that you're dependant of floor mats and haven't harvested before. Because after two weeks I can't tell the difference. And for the Llama nerf I think it sucks, because when you find one of those rare beautiful creatures it should be a huge celebration. But it's not game breaking now that they lost 900 mats, at least not for me, because I didn't find them every game. Not even every tenth, so I don't actually care if in say 29 of 30 games my opponents have a 1500 mat advantage.
Now another change is coming, a change that definitely needs us to adapt and to get used to, but you know what? Nothing will happen. The game won't die. It will still be a building game and it will still be Fortnite, the most played game on the planet, the game that has 125 million players, like no other game on planet earth.

Balance changes are always frightening, because they force us to leave our comfort zone but in the end they are needed and they are healthy for the game and the variety of possible playstyles. 
Why should playing a sniper only be viable in sniper shootout? Why should being sneaky only be viable in sneaky silencers? Why should a fetish for explosives not also be a viable but balanced playstyle?

Let Epic experiment with their game, they haven't had many wrong decisions until now, that's why they grew a f2p game to the biggest brand on the planet, to a pop culture rather than just a game.
And if everything goes wrong, you should all know by now, that they also revert poor decisions if needed.

We'll see what the future brings, I'm hyped for the upcoming changes and for seeing the game moving forward from just one playstyle.

Greetings,
Tegra


**TL;DR:**
Epic knows what they're doing and they'll revert it if they're completely wrong. A change to building and materials as well as the weapon balance is needed for the game to still feel fresh in several years. There shouldn't only be one playstyle and it's not toxic for the game to move on.

But this is for all the people too afraid to counter argue the recent plethora of posts raging against the Man.

Material. Capping.

Holy shit people, let it be. First off, if there is all ready three pages worth of posts on the subject, just pick one to comment on, don't raise the same tired point in your own unique post. You dont deserve the karma, and it just makes the community look like we all went full autist.

Secondly, community. Reddit doesn't represent Fortnite players. Quit assuming that just because its a decent way to get good ideas to the Devs, that it is fully representative of the player base, and what it wants. I see far too many people using ""Obviously the community hates it"" as an excuse.

C) (ha) Material Capping is an idea. Just like lower material gathering. Just like build height. Just like heavy shotguns. They are constantly going to be changing their game, not just because they want to fix some issues either physical or social, but to keep things fresh; to evolve the play style so that your 250th win doesn't look like your 60th win, and still feels like your 1st. 

Don't mention test servers. The whole flippin' game is a test server. This is how progress happens. By all means, publicize your doubt. ""I dont think mat limits will do what the Devs hope to achieve"" is a valid opinion. ""Campers will likely conserve more mats than aggresive players"" is a good point on the subject to make. 

But none of it is fact. Its not something that should push the Devs from exploring their theory. let them implement the change, and then *play the damn game*. Play, then judge. Because then you can post ""Yeah, in my experience, game play hasn't gotten more exciting, i've just lost to camping noobs more often."" and have it mean something.

All your complaints and whining wont change anything. At least I hope it wouldn't. All you're doing is filling the community with ""Oh no, the sky is falling"" doomsayers.

We know this, **Epic knows this**, hell my older brother who has never even played the game knows this. So why would Epic want to take this aspect of the game away from us? **I think I have the answer**.

When most of us played Fortnite for the first time **everyone sucked** and building was rare. This meant that **every game seemed possible to win**, which made it even more gut wrenching when you lost. So naturally all of us turned to the internet to get better, we began to see the possibilities with build fights and the overall skill of the community skyrocketed. 

This has happened so many times in the past with games like League Of Legends, Dota, CS:GO and Starcraft. The problem is we expect Epic to want to become a game like any of those listed when in reality **the game has already become like Minecraft** (which is ironically why they need to stop us building). Let me explain.

I love this game and don't want to see Epic take away the main thing that makes it unique, but the average player doesn't play it because of the building, they **play it because it was the only free, easily accessible battle royal game available** to them.  

Fortnite has become more than just a competitive video game, it is a phenomenon much like how Minecraft once was. Everyone on the planet has heard of Fortnite which means the **player base has expanded much further than just the competitive**. Personally I love getting into a intense build fight with a Omega skin, but I would bet that to the majority of players this is daunting and results in them turning the game off after they die. Epic will be tracking data and will see this. They know that when Ninja goes and destroys 18 people in a match **4/5 of those people quit the game afterwards because they cant possibly win.** 

And truth be told even I have been feeling it at times, I love competitive games with huge skill ceilings but as the best players get better it means **the ones who can't keep up get stomped** and that just isn't fun to play. Epic has the largest player base out of any game right now, but to keep it they are going to have to do more than just meteors and jet packs. **They need to give everyone the rush of honestly thinking they can win again.** 

# 

# So how should Epic fix this? 

Epic have made it pretty clear that they want to lower the skill ceiling slightly which is honestly understandable **but I don't think its the right move.** 

If we look at League Of Legends, Dota, CS:GO and Starcraft they have solved this problem by adding skill based match matching so even the players who suck don't get stomped. When I started playing League Of Legends, if I was **put against Diamond players every game, I wouldn't have played it for long**.  If I had it my way I would add a ranked system to Fortnite with a required minimum account level to play but it's becoming clear that Epic don't want to add this for some reason so I have another solution. 

**Put people in games with people of similar win streaks and lose streaks** (or maybe top 25 streaks). 1 win streak gets you put into games with everyone who has won recently, 3 win streak gets you put into a game with better people, 5+ wins in a row all get put into games together, the players who can get 5 wins in a row would most likely prefer the slightly longer queue timers for better matches with more on the line. **\*If even with the huge player the queue times do get too large change all of these examples to top 25/10\***

On the other side of this 20 games without top 25 in a row results in you getting put into a game with people who also haven't had a top 25 in 20 games. You could possibly get people who deliberately throw to get into this queue but eventually they would most likely win a game and get thrown back to having to spend hours throwing games again.

# TLDR: 

# Fortnite is too complex to please both the competitive and casual players with the way it is. Unlike games like League Of Legends most players are casual players so If Epic want to keep making a lot of money they have to appeal to casual players as well as Competitive. Casuals get bodied every game now so they aren't having fun. So add a match making system that puts people against players on a similar win/lost streak to minimize the amount of casual vs competitive encounters and give everyone the rush of winning again.

Now you will tell me they're not removing building. Sure, but nerfing will have the same effects on a smaller scale and right now that's the direction this game is taking.

Instead of focusing on creating win incentives to stop the game from being stale Epic decide to constantly attack the fun &amp; skillful aspect of the game.
Now you will tell me winning should be enough of a reward on its own. That's not how it works. If winning gets stale, it gets stale you can't change that with naive, wishful thinking. 
Now you will tell me these changes are brought to keep the game fresh and help stop it from becoming stale. Maybe. But without building what is this game really? A less than average 3rd person shooters. With less building that's one step closer to what this game will become.

Instead of focusing on fixing SBMM or competitive game modes with ladder rankings they decide to constantly attack the fun &amp; skillful aspect of the game.
Now you will tell me they've had two showdowns LTMs and have invested 100m in their competitive scene. Not enough.  Merely two poor showdowns where you need to grind 25+ games in a few days. There needs to be a constant ranking ladder mode. Sure, it was their first effort in creating a competitive game mode and it would have been fine, but after seeing the direction the game is going it's utterly disappointing. And how can you invest in a competitive scene without even having a current ranking mode? 

Take a look at Epic as a company. Their experience in games is not the best. It is clear they hit the jackpot with this game and have no idea why. I see a lot of talk of catering to ""casuals"", but really too many people think casuals despise building. Casuals are the guys who like to squad up and have fun with their friends after a long day or week of work / school. You are thinking of newbies who have no idea what they're doing, these people are not the majority of the game as most people may think. The majority stems from players who are already gamers coming with experiences from all sorts of shooters and take building on the chin. As stated before, building is what makes this game different. There's hundreds of shooters out there. We are here for building.

Now you will tell me this post is too negative. Take a look at Epic's post. After the uproar that came with Resource nerfs, they continue to tell us more nerfs are incoming with no other insight but "" counter other players in combat "", you either build or shoot someone before they shoot you and with bloom have fun with that. This isn't a moba, it is a shooters game with an unparalleled building mechanic never seen before. Keep it that way.

Yes, Building is a core aspect - Doesn't mean it should dictate the whole game. 

They recently hosted the first Official EU-Tournament. Have you seen it? Or any Pro Scrim for that matter? That's not what an eSport should look like. The Final Circle inhabited up to 30 players and each game ended with a Healing Duel. 

And as we all know Epic tries hard, very hard, to make Fortnite an eSport. Any change that will be implemented in regards to Building spawned from the evil idea of having to create a competitive environment. A fraction of the Community even wants the game to become an eSport, yet they change the game with that goal in mind - That's the inherent problem. 

Why is nobody complaining about forcing Fortnite to become an eSport? Not every game is supposed to be one and Battle Royale games generally don't fir into that category. 


Overall I just think that most people in this sub complain about the wrong things or confront problems in the wrong way. 

On top of that I seriously think Building is also an issue in Normals. Continuous 1x1 spam in Solos and Turtling is not only annoying but stales the game. And I thought players were all for fast Gameplay, yet both of these tactics deny any kind of speed.",FortNiteBR

I can understand from a noob or kids point of view it can be frustrating as more and more people learn to build like Ninja, Myth, ect. HOWEVER that is what makes this game so fun, the INSANELY HIGH skill ceiling which is introduced by building. My idea is to introduce a skill-based matchmaking system. That way very good players can play vs very good players with a lot of build offs, and lower skilled players can play vs lower skilled players. 

TL;DR: Epic stop making Fortnite less skill based and introduce skill based matchmaking so people who are new or suck at building can still enjoy the game and good players can still have build fights all the time and the fun not taken out by ""noob changes"" such as say lower resource caps, which would ONLY benefit the worse player.",FortNiteBR

When you are knocked you have no choice but to wait until your health goes to zero after 50 ticks of 2 damage or you are thirsted. In order to be sacrificed, the player alive has to press a button (same mechanic as reviving) for x amount of seconds (2 or 3 seconds?) which will give the knocked player an option to choose ""yes"" or ""no"" for the sacrifice to happen (which will avoid abuse and trolling).

This could possibly give you a competitive edge against your opponent and I wanted to share with the Fortnite Community =\] Here are the changes I made (windows 10):

1a) Update Windows (of course).

1b) Update your network drivers. (search Device Manager &gt; Go to Network Adapter &gt; right-click and choose Update Driver &gt; Select Choose Online for Driver).

2) Reboot Router (Do not press reset button so you avoid factory reset). Leave power off for a good 2 minutes or so.

3) Right-click on the Start button and select Device Manager then double click on the network card and go to Advanced tab. From there, pick Large Send Offload V2 (IPv4) &gt; Value &gt; select ""Disabled"". DO THE SAME with Large Send Offload V2 (IPv6). Click OK.

4) Go back to Advanced Tab from above then go to Speed &amp; Duplex &gt; select the value ""100MBPS Full Duplex"". (Note: this will make your internet speed on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) cap at 95 or so but is preferred over auto-negotiation, for a reason I have not researched yet but it works!).

5) Disable IPv6: right-click the Network icon on the taskbar (bottom right of desktop) and click Open Network and Internet Settings and then click on Change adapter options. From here, double click Ethernet and choose Properties. Find ""Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6), un-tick box and click OK.

When you are all finished with the above changes, Go to your search bar and type in ""cmd"". You will see Command Prompt... Right click that and Run As Administrator. Once you are in the command prompt, type in: ""ipconfig /flushdns"" (Without QUOTATIONS). It should say: Successfuly flushed the DNS Resolver Cache. THEN type: ""netsh winsock reset"" (Without QUOTATIONS). Restart your computer, run Fortnite and check your ping.

This meta can be a big show if those fights were an exception, but being staple it means: 1-if you have few mats you are probably screwed; 2-most likely you can use just the shotties due to them being perfect for the fit; 3-it's absurdly repetitive while building should be the fun and creative part that makes the game stand over the other BRs. Yes it's satisfying being able to outbuild the opponent, but as i said before 1v1 are streamlined in this game atm.

People raging about getting low damage shotgun shots due to RNG and if only it did fixed damage etc etc... This mechanic is most probably helping u more than it's hindering you. 

What is this?? Why?? I have been a professional poker player for 15 years. My livelihood has literally been directly influenced for years by 'RNG ' . I have heard thousands of players complain about how unlucky they are instead of understanding how limited their skill set is. The number of moments people are actually unlucky compared to the number they think they are is incredibly small. People who get lucky 5 minutes previously but think that they deserved it will then rage when a bit of bad luck comes.  It's human nature to focus more on the bad than the good. What else I have learnt from poker is that the people that complain the most are usually (but not always) the less skilled players. They are simply too inexperienced to understand the bigger picture. 

If u get 9. 8. 6. Shotgun damage 2 things have likely happened. U have missed by more than you think... Or you or the enemy has lagged. 90% plus of RNG rage cases are probably due to these 2 reasons. The lag issue is annoying no doubt but it's an internet game and it is just a frustrating fact of life. Sometimes you feel like u hit someone dead on but if u actually go to the replay u will see that you actually just missed... but what is important to realise... the real key fact... is this happens to everyone. Everyone. I repeat. Everyone. Everyone deals with the same mechanics. Whether it is bloom or shotgun RNG. If all your lost games are so dependent on either of these things then the reality is your not as good as you think you are. If you were consistently fighting from truly advantageous situations. High ground. Quick peeks. Etc hitting the odd 9 won't mean you lose the fight. All the streamers out there hit 8 damage shotgun shots... it just usually doesn't matter as they 're in a dominant position and can hit more shots. If your games are coming down to a 1 on 1 shot gun battle on the ground where you are both jumping around not blocking or building or resetting the fight.... then your skill set is lacking more than your luck. Did you engage the fight correctly. Did u defend properly. Did u build enough? Did u build at all? Did you successfully gain high ground before shooting? Did you rest fight to heal? Did you leave yourself exposed and easy to hit? All of these are factors to be considered before simply saying how unlucky you are that you did 38 damage and he did 160

Last and most important point. All the shotgun fights you win... All of them... have the same RNG element. There is someone on the other side that lost and is raging that they hit you for 8 and you killed them. Fights you win aren't Always that you are just so good and you got that noob that try hard etc etc. Sometimes luck is with you but you see it as you getting what you deserve or as your superior skill prevailing. 

After every death... take 10 seconds thinking about what else you could have done differently... 9 times out of 10 you will think of at least something you could improve on.... And that other 1 out of 10? Rage on my brothers and sisters!

Thanks for reading. Happy fragging

People will think twice about repeatedly building on top of one another, and spam building will get you killed really quickly, whereas right now it’s really annoying.

In fact, I’m the exact opposite.

Step 1. Build your game up by adding new things and trying new things slowly.

Step 2. Acquire streamers and popularity amongst the community. Sooner or later, a meta will set in.

Now on to how to ruin it...

Step 3. Never fix crucial bugs, continue adding new items no one asked for and new skins, need that money am I right?

Step 4. Only appeal to casuals. Give hardcore gamers a slap in the face.

Step 5. Drastically change the meta so that casuals have the same chance at winning as a gamer with hundreds of hours under his belt, and make skill completely irrelevant to the chances of winning.

Step 6. Watch as your streamers leave for better games that are consistent and appeal to all audiences.

Step 7. Shut down the game out of no where, as Epic has done in the past.

Now, developers, I know your asking yourselves, how do we prevent this? Well, as overwatch did, change the meta very slowly so players have time to adapt. We are set for a crash course towards imminent destruction of Fortnite BR when the meta is changed abruptly. I know you devs probably won’t see this, but if you do I suggest you listen if you want to keep your wages up.

If you agree with me, upvote this to get the devs to see. I doubt it will change anything, but it’s worth a shot. If you disagree, please have a civil discussion.",FortNiteBR

I would say ""it's not like The Division subreddit, it's not like the Destiny subreddit"". I would tell my friends it's actually not toxic and a breathe of fresh air. We were a community.

Then they nerfed double pumps. It was still tolerable but was showing signs of toxicity. But when they changed the reload mechanics this place really fell to shit.

1000+ hours on BR and it wasn't the game that made me quit, it was this community.

I switched back to Save The World and to EVE online.

Do you know how whiny and toxic you have to be as a community for someone to choose EVE online over you?

Epic isn't killing this game.

I’d like to start off by saying I love fortnite and it has done a lot for me in a tough part of my life. 

With that said, it is UNACCEPTABLE that my account was banned without any heads up or explanation from Epic Games. 
PS4
A little backstory: Just over about a month ago I went over to my friends house to play fortnite and wanted to login on my account to continue my progress at his house. Unfortunately, when I logged in, my friend (who is no longer my friend) copied my email and epic info (because it was the same) and took over my email and costing me control of everything, literally everything. After weeks on end of battling for my email access with google support, just about a week ago I fully recovered all of my information and access to my account (yay!...). From what I can tell my epic and email account had been bouncing around the internet for a very long but, nonetheless, I was ecstatic! But, yesterday going into my account I was told “your account is inactive and may not login”. After some hefty research I believe I have been banned... UGH. This is such a terrible freakin situation and I honestly have no idea what to do. I just got my account back and now it’s gone... 

Please, if anyone can help me resolve this or ya any insight that would be great. I don’t think epic will respond to my email because it sounds like these bans are irreversible I guess I don’t understand. 
I even went as FAR as to going to their headquarters and asking whoever I could about this and was left out to dry with vague verbatim responses and overall irritation. 

This has by far been the most frustrating video game experience I have ever dealt with and I have poured hundreds of dollars into this game since I started back in December. And I am extremely hesitant (as I should be) to restart and spend money on the game AGAIN.

PLEASE Epic Games, let me play the game I love again!!!

I just want to set a layout for EPIC because this game is on a slight downfall. I won’t be explaining all as most have to do with epic favoring the casual players (which myself I am and believe it’s not fair to the skilled players that actually put time into this game)

•Decreased Bloom
        - Not completely get rid of, just majorly decreased

•Building back to where it was
       - It’s the only thing special about this game

•Series of fixed spreads for shotguns for more predictability
       - Not complaining about bad aim giving me 9, but when you aim at a head the bullets can still RNG to where they all hit the outside of the head instead of the middle, but with a series of fixed spreads, players can be more confident in their skills)

•Playground Mode
     - Epic, this is what YOU want. A way for casual players to be under no stress and get better. This is everything you’ve been trying to do solved into one LTM that you could release. Also permanent.

•Something for winning
    - No VBucks, this is really up to you Epic, but players who have more than 50-100 wins are losing the hype of those original wins and in my opinion, I need something hype to get when I win, (even if it’s small it’s something)

• Option for OG Music
      - Out of everything here, I personally value this the most. For those that didn’t play S2 or below won’t get it but that music, it’s brings back so many awesome memories of this game reaching its prime. You can keep the music how it is but have an optional switch somewhere in settings. It would bring back so many memories and possibly make players stay on the game that were just about to leave for good. 

• No more chest location challenges
     -Although it can be fun at times being in the chaos (specifically in snipers only), it’s the worst challenge and brings no joy when you realize it’s going to take you 10 or more games to just get 5 tiers


I’ll be adding more as comments come in as I might be forgetting a lot. Please comment your opinions!

And let me clarify - by “important” I mean which shows who is the most skilled. (Let me explain before you downvote the fck out of me)

In my opinion, it’s the wins. When you get a win you outplayed every single person in that game. Sounds crazy, right? Well it’s true.

Just because you don’t go against someone doesn’t mean you didn’t fight them. In survival game modes, especially BR games, you’re fighting everyone at once. Whether they’re in Risky and you’re in Lucky, you did fight them.

Wins show how skilled you are. Maybe some games you went against good players, maybe some you went against bad players. It still shows that you outplayed those players.

Kills, on the other hand, COMPLETELY RELY ON RNG. If you want to get a 20 kill game you land Tilted and go ham. 

Wins also rely on RNG, but it’s definitely not as much. Winning a game shows that you adapted and got your way through the game.

I’ve gotten a few 1 kill wins myself. Obviously it’s not something to brag about, but it does show that while I may have stayed out of sticky situations I still won the game.

(Which leads to the build fights that Epic wants to move away from)

It would add an interesting playstyle to the game that we have not seen besides from the very early game release when not many people built. 

However with this it would be a great nerf to shotguns which I think is unnecessary. I would like to see shotguns return to their normal damage state but only being able to carry one would mean you have to either pick; high damage with the pump or more shots with the tac.

I'm sure many of us are in the same boat. We launched fortnite at the beginning of the season, saw that dark power ranger looking skin in the background, and  we all had to have it. That thirst only increased since the colored lights introduction. The hard truth is most of us will not get to level 80 and not unlock full omega, and that's OK. Fortnite would need to be treated as a part time job to hit level 80 this season; so if you work, go to school, or both, full omega is not for you. I've seen several posts both on here, and on the discord asking *Will I make it if I'm Level X?* and they usually come to the conclusion: *Yes, but only if I grind 4-5hrs/day everyday for the rest of the season*, which they further rationalize with *I'll stay up late everynight, and use all my free time to grind xp*. If this sounds like you, you have a problem, and full omega is not worth the added stress. Grinding that much **will** burn you out, and you'll end up hating the game as all the fun would be sucked up with the numbers for the grind. This is a pretty shared sentiment right now for those who've grinded or attempted to grind level 80. 


**Epic:**

Next season, please listen and learn from the community for the tier 100 challenge grind. Omega's problem is that it's more time based than skill based, and forcing players to sink hours-on-end into the game will only make them resent it as a chore rather than a game. If there's something similar to omega next season, give each light color its own set of challenges (3-5), challenges more skill based that way each color carries its own gravitas. imo, make them win-based or skill-based. i.e. 500 kills for bright red lights, 15 solo wins for green lights, 15 squad wins for purple lights etc etc. This rewards better players, doesn't cripple solo players (many's fate this season for xp grind), and the skin maintains its intimidation factor. 

#tl;dr: There's no shame in not having full-omega if you simply don't have the time sink for it. If you can't realistically make it by the end of the season, don't try and force yourself or you'll hate the game. Epic, make next season's tier 100 challenges more rely on skill than time spent in game.",FortNiteBR

You just post the patch notes with no insight as to what you are trying to acomplish leaving every single person to form their own ideas and rant about how the game is going downhill and getting killed.

TL;DR:
Redditors, don't be so quick to judge everything and let the developers work in peace while you continue to enjoy the game. It takes experimenting to figure out the best formula for the game(especially to balance between casual and upcoming esports)

-Season 5 Moisty Mire will be destroyed and Pirate Ships will take place there, making it a beach like area.

-Guided missiles will back but they will be controlled drones, they do not damage players but they are used mostly like UAV's.

-There is a new mortar weapon from Save The World introduced to Battle Royale.

-C4's get another major buff where placing 4 of them in each corner of Tilted Towers destroys the entire city.

-Epic nerfs materials in Blitz mode making it feel like Season 4 standard mode.

-Season 6... Never played it, game is dead. Everyone gave up since Epic keeps nerfing everything and loves casuals.

My current job even allows me to game somewhat while I work. As such I've been able to grind out every weekly challenge on the day it releases and I've nailed all of my daily ones. Now I honestly I got into the season a couple weeks late. I was only around level 20 or so when I got the battlepass week 3. But then it seemed getting max level was totally possible. Now at level 60 and pass rank 89, it doesn't feel possible. 

This is a major problem with multiplayer games now. In order to get the coolest items you practically have to have an unhealthy game vs life balance. If want to reach level 80 I will have to choose to ignore going out with friends, ignore the gym and generally sacrifice anything else in my life to do it. I can't play another game because the XP needed for 80 is so high.

Perhaps the solution is to play squads. But my friends all have lives outside of this game. They are not constantly on to grind for some lights on the omega skin.

Now you might say this is a reward for the dedicated players, but unless you are incredibly skilled to always win, the time sink is insane and it really makes the reward uncool because of it cost that person to get it. The omega skin is unlocked through completing many challenges, but level 80 is unlocked by spending too much time on this game and it's frankly stupid.

The nerf might not be as drastic as you think. Epic trying to curate a variety of play styles MAY ACTUALLY MAKE LATE-TO-END GAME MORE INTERESTING.

Also, is nerfing mats really going to be an issue? I’d say on average I have 500 wood, 250 brick and 100 steel during a game, with leftovers after a win. Picking up mats from killed opponents give the mat stock plenty high.  

I don’t think Epic is going to destroy the core mechanic of their game. Not build battles, but building in general.

Building is currently both the best thing about Fortnite and the most skill-based aspect of the game. It is *not* a playstyle; it is a core mechanic of the game and should remain as such since it is the most rewarding, unique, and skill-based thing about Fortnite. To diminish it would be to harm the very reason we're all playing it in the first place.

**Long Post:** This thread is a direct response to the ""Counterplay and Play Styles"" article the Fortnite Team released recently. As a player who spent hundreds of hours mastering the building aspect of this game, I am immensely frustrated that Epic continuously tries to alter/reduce what is easily the best part of this game. Without it, this is nothing more than an extremely average third person shooter that has no real identity of its own.

&gt; It’s important to support a variety of late game strategies, that don’t boil down to “just build lol”

Except that combat doesn't boil down to ""just build lol"". Yes, most of it involves building, but this statement gravely oversimplifies the building system in this game. There are many strategies *within* the building system itself that players can employ to win the build battle. You don't simply run at your opponent and ""just build,"" you have to actually know what you're doing and build better than them. All it takes to understand this is to watch a skilled builder take on multiple opponents at once and win, or watching them fight multiple build battles without getting hit once.

Also, what other interesting and engaging strategies does Fortnite support? Bush camping with a silenced weapon? Stacking C4 and spamming them in your opponents direction until you kill them? Minigunning down everything your opponent builds? Seriously, what else is there? The strategies that require the most skill in this game are practically all wrapped within the building system. Any high level player will tell you that the one who builds better than their opponent is usually going to win any 1v1 (assuming both players have sufficient materials). And there's no problem with that, it's simply a core mechanic of the game.

&gt; Not every encounter should have to end in a build-off.

Assuming we mean mid/late game encounters (nobody has enough materials for a build-off early game), why not? Why is this bad? In other shooting games, the encounters all just end in a shoot-off or someone dying quickly because their opponent saw them first. Fortnite's identity is building; learning how to build is how you win encounters. The community praises Blitz endlessly, and that mode demonstrates an extreme circumstance where many encounters actually do end in a build-off because everyone has materials all the time. Judging from that, how did Epic gather that less encounters should end in a build-off?

Besides, what exactly are the alternatives that Fortnite offers here? In other words, how are battles ending when they don't end with building? A close range bunny hopping shotgun fight? A mid-range shoot off with an RNG bloom system and where neither player will peek first because they don't want to get instantly killed by a ghost peek shot? A long-range sniper battle that has the same ghost peek problems? Epic said nothing within the post about reworking the shooting model, so these are the alternatives we have and they are all less fun, less engaging, and require less skill. When both players are skilled, close range build-offs are preferable (in terms of both skill and entertainment) to every other way a battle can end. 

&gt; We are exploring changes...to resource economy, like e.g. resource caps.

Aside from generally being a bad idea, I don't think this would exactly accomplish Epic's goal of being able to ""find Victory Royale through multiple strategies"" anyway. For one, lowering the resource cap would decrease a players incentive and willingness to be aggressive because they would have less materials to support extended fights. In addition to this, the only reason this would cause less fights to end in a build-off would be because more players would simply run out of materials and get killed easily as a result of it. There would be more lopsided battles where one player has materials because he has been farming and goes against someone who has none/less because he has been fighting. The only strategy I see this promoting would be to fight less because it would be easier to run out of materials and die. Any significant lowering of the resource cap would also greatly increase the amount of time players are forced to spend farming - the most boring part of this game - since it would be easier to run out of materials. Most of the current complaints about this game are that you have to spend too much time farming, so why is increasing that time in any way even being considered anyway?

&gt; We strongly believe that the evolution of Fortnite supports a wide range of play styles...We want to empower you to showcase your skill, strategy, and tactics in all variety of ways.

If you take nothing else away from this post, let it be that the most skill-based and engaging way combat can end in Fortnite pretty much always involves building. Nerfing building to allow other tactics to shine would be a poor idea because the alternatives that Fortnite offers are completely inferior. When players are building very little or not building at all, we either have a close range bunny hopping shotgun fight, a cancerous RNG and ghost peek oriented mid-range assault rifle battle, or a sniper shootout. Sure, there are gimmicky ways you can kill people with things like C4 or Clinger spam, but building is and should remain the primary way to win.

I love the building aspect of the game and the skill gap that it creates. However, with the introduction of turbo building and auto material change, people are getting used to spam build and just build up, and some of the times these people are not even good builders.

It is actually getting tiresome for me to have to spend so much materials in one fight because of how the meta of the game is right now. 90% of the people that I kill are at least decent builders and it is actually boring having to build so much without focusing on gun play, which is also a very important aspect of this game which is ultimately a shooting game, not a building game. 

Reducing the amount of materials will actually encourage people to build smarter and more efficiently while also focusing on gun play. That is my opinion.

I do still a free that guns need work for all these changes to have a positive impact on the game. ",FortNiteBR

However, it shouldn't come down to just building to get an easy win. People complain about building being ""nerfed"" because that's the one thing they rely on.

Who needs skill when you can just build a fort and hide?! I support the fact that Epic is trying to support new strategies instead of just focusing on building. Building is important, but so is the rest of the gameplay. It's not like they want to get rid of building completely. They want to encourage new playstyles.

Even with the ""resource caps"" and ""nerfs"" they want to make, you can still build. It doesn't matter whether you can build less or a lot. At least you're getting to build. I might be downvoted to hell, but it's just my opinion.

As a player who spent hundreds of hours mastering the building aspect of this game, I am immensely frustrated that Epic continuously tries to alter/reduce what is easily the best part of this game. Without it, this is nothing more than an extremely average third person shooter that has no real identity of its own.

&gt; It’s important to support a variety of late game strategies, that don’t boil down to “just build lol”

Except that combat doesn't boil down to ""just build lol"". Yes, most of it involves building, but this statement gravely oversimplifies the building system in this game. There are many strategies *within* the building system itself that players can employ to win the build battle. You don't simply run at your opponent and ""just build,"" you have to actually know what you're doing and build better than them. All it takes to understand this is to watch a skilled builder take on multiple opponents at once and win, or watching them fight multiple build battles without getting hit once.

Also, what other interesting and engaging strategies does Fortnite support? Bush camping with a silenced weapon? Stacking C4 and spamming them in your opponents direction until you kill them? Minigunning down everything your opponent builds? Seriously, what else is there? The strategies that require the most skill in this game are practically all wrapped within the building system. Any high level player will tell you that the one who builds better than their opponent is usually going to win any 1v1 (assuming both players have sufficient materials). And there's no problem with that, it's simply a core mechanic of the game.

&gt; Not every encounter should have to end in a build-off.

Assuming we mean mid/late game encounters (nobody has enough materials for a build-off early game), why not? Why is this bad? In other shooting games, the encounters all just end in a shoot-off or someone dying quickly because their opponent saw them first. Fortnite's identity is building; learning how to build is how you win encounters. The community praises Blitz endlessly, and that mode demonstrates an extreme circumstance where many encounters actually do end in a build-off because everyone has materials all the time. Judging from that, how did Epic gather that less encounters should end in a build-off?

Besides, what exactly are the alternatives that Fortnite offers here? In other words, how are battles ending when they don't end with building? A close range bunny hopping shotgun fight? A mid-range shoot off with an RNG bloom system and where neither player will peek first because they don't want to get instantly killed by a ghost peek shot? A long-range sniper battle that has the same ghost peek problems? Epic said nothing within the post about reworking the shooting model, so these are the alternatives we have and they are all less fun, less engaging, and require less skill. When both players are skilled, close range build-offs are preferable (in terms of both skill and entertainment) to every other way a battle can end. 

&gt; We are exploring changes...to resource economy, like e.g. resource caps.

Aside from generally being a bad idea, I don't think this would exactly accomplish Epic's goal of being able to ""find Victory Royale through multiple strategies"" anyway. For one, lowering the resource cap would decrease a players incentive and willingness to be aggressive because they would have less materials to support extended fights. In addition to this, the only reason this would cause less fights to end in a build-off would be because more players would simply run out of materials and get killed easily as a result of it. There would be more lopsided battles where one player has materials because he has been farming and goes against someone who has none/less because he has been fighting. The only strategy I see this promoting would be to fight less because it would be easier to run out of materials and die. Any significant lowering of the resource cap would also greatly increase the amount of time players are forced to spend farming - the most boring part of this game - since it would be easier to run out of materials. Most of the current complaints about this game are that you have to spend too much time farming, so why is increasing that time in any way even being considered anyway?

&gt; We strongly believe that the evolution of Fortnite supports a wide range of play styles...We want to empower you to showcase your skill, strategy, and tactics in all variety of ways.

If you take nothing else away from this post, let it be that the most skill-based and engaging way combat can end in Fortnite pretty much always involves building. Nerfing building to allow other tactics to shine would be a poor idea because the alternatives that Fortnite offers are completely inferior. When players are building very little or not building at all, we either have a close range bunny hopping shotgun fight, a cancerous RNG and ghost peek oriented mid-range assault rifle battle, or a sniper shootout. Sure, there are gimmicky ways you can kill people with things like C4 or Clinger spam, but building is and should remain the primary way to win. 

TL;DR: Epic is trying to ""support a variety of late game strategies,"" without having a game that possesses other interesting, unique aspects aside from building. Building is currently both the best thing about Fortnite and the most skill-based aspect of the game. It is *not* a playstyle; it is a core mechanic of the game and should remain as such since it is the most rewarding, unique, and skill-based thing about Fortnite. To diminish it would be to harm the very reason we're all playing it in the first place.",FortNiteBR

I wanted to share some of my ideas, and I also wanted to share some that the community created.

— Choose Your Reward —

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8sud7p/who_would_want_that/?st=JIP2R032&amp;sh=0ec134df
This idea would allow players to choose their own reward after winning a match. Some of the rewards shown are probably subject to change, but the idea in general could work. It would be a direct prize given, and it could really make a win much more satisfying.

— Royale Tickets —

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8aiqy1/suggestion_we_should_get_100_vbucks_for_a_win_or/?st=JIP30LF6&amp;sh=1d96df42
This would add “Royale Tickets” to the game. You would be granted some after winning a game, and having enough would allow you to buy an item off the shop. This would allow people to have exclusive skins only available to those who had, for example, 20 wins. This could definitely encourage players to push towards a victory royale in every game. Those exclusive skins would have much more value than skins that you buy with V-bucks. Overall, this idea is pretty awesome.

— Display Your Wins In-game —

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8271za/game_idea_if_you_win_the_previous_game_you_get_a/?st=JIP36GFD&amp;sh=974eeac5
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8sm4br/display_number_of_wins_on_armband_or_change_color/?st=JIP38TS1&amp;sh=ecc7494e
Both of these ideas would display your wins in game, but in different ways. I think the second one is more reasonable, but they both have potential.

— Battle Pass Challenges —

For my own idea, they should add a lot more different and unique challenges surrounding wins. Here are some examples I made:

Win a game after landing in Snobby Shores
Win a game without picking up any grenades
Win a game without looting any chests
Win a game of solo duos

These might be too challenging for some, but these are just ideas.

With epic statement about the end fights always being shotguns and rockets and building, they are talking about nerfing building etc which for me would kill the game.

Surely obvious fixes are 1 shotgun, rockets maybe have fall off damage ? IMO Grenade launchers should shoot 4 bullets and not 6 before reloading, to me it seems they are going way over the top to balance things, this way regarding the shotgun you know what you have and adjust your play style to suit it, instead everyone carries two and it of course makes you play aggressive because you know you probably just need two shots that you can take in under a second...",FortNiteBR

Chaning the meta isn't a bad thing. The materials nerf, new weapons and shotgun nerfs are all very needed changes for this game.

These changes definitely shrink the skill gap between experienced players who know the meta inside out and newer players who are struggling to catch up to the experienced players. This meta was getting stale with the winners of each game playing the exact same playstyle and the new players being left behind. If these changes were never announced and the game stayed the way it was into season 5 this sub would be full of people complaining about how the meta never changed and how boring every game has become.

All the changes should lead to new and varied play styles that each player will have to learn putting new and old players on an even playing field and letting people learn the new skills and strategies instead of falling back into just playing the meta while complaining about it. People who are comfortable with the current meta can see it's getting stale and that changing it and allowing new players in on a new breed of action and new play styles could potentially make the game more competitive.

Hopefully these changes work out and make the game not only more fun for everyone put also more competitive after people figure out new playstyles. Even if it doesn't work this game is still early access and EPIC can revert the changes and take all the information they learnt from this and improve the game from there.",FortNiteBR

288,DANK_F0RTN1TER,1529616872,8svruf,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8svruf/epic_fix_your_game/,5,Epic Fix Your Game,"**Introduction**

In recent updates and patches, Epic games have nerfed certain features and weapons in fortnite that ( in my opinion) have ruined the game completely . In this post I will point out nerfs and patches that I am not happy with.

**The Pump Shotgun**

The pump is one of the best weapons in the game as it became very popular when a Daequan crested the double pump strategy.  Instead of the normal 2.5 headshot multiplier , Epic nerfed the pumps to just a X2 multiplier. Now whats the point of a high risk, high reward weapon when the heavy shotgun has a higher rate of fire, more range and a hell of alot more damage on a headshot . I mean the statistics show that legendary heavys do approximately 193 damage with a firerate of 1.00 whereas the rare pump only does 170 with a 0.7 firerate . Now tell me if that is not unbalanced ? 

**The Loot LLamas**

Loot llamas used to be something that gave players a real advantage ad it gave them 500 of each material in total but now they only give you 200 of each. 200 Hundred is quite puny considering that pro players can mine that in the time it takes to opn a llama . This has sort of made llamas not that big of a deal now beacause often players only open them for a meme pad and some healing items.

**Rocket And Grenade Launchers** 

These used to be phenominal weapons that could shift a game in your favour and absolutely demolish players and structures alike. However, these days have come to a close becaus epic games have transformed two of fortnite's best weapons into some 13 shot disaster ! I think that this nerf is ridiculous as  having a decent amount of ammo is crucial in fortnite, infact I remember using a legendary vending machine to buy an RPG and it gave me 12 ammo so 13 shots in total .

**Conclusion**

Fortnite is a brilliant game that I genuinly love but if Epic don't fix it, there will be problems in the future . Also many times with shotguns my shots are not registering so I will mention this again; Epic fix Fortnite . ",FortNiteBR

We've got great points and we've helped get this game to where it is. Let's work together and be persistent and let Epic know what we want.
TL;DR for Epic- We understand the need to make the game friendly for the new guys so you can grow. We have some ideas that can do that without upsetting your current base. Your growth window is closing, help keep your current base happy for sustainable success. 


I'm going to make a post summing up what a lot of us have said and feel. If you disagree with what I say, talk about it. If I'm not in the majority, I'll change it to reflect the communities view.  Maybe this will gain traction, maybe not but we've got to keep trying to get to Epic. We love this game. That's why we're here. Epic has shown the ability to listen to our requests before when there's enough of a voice behind it and it fits their vision. Continuing to make these changes are supposed to make the game fresh and easy enough for the new players coming in. Only problem with that is, youve probably already peaked. This game is HUGE. Not many more playerss will be coming in. In addition to that, the next big game is around the corner. You'll lose the hype. You need to keep a dedicated following who will stay when the hype leaves. Look at games like wow and lol. I can't play either. I tried to get in too late and the skill ceiling is too high. That's fine, they're still one of the biggest games around for staying true to their following. Here's some things we want to see fixed and/or happen. 

Building- ""just build lol"" is the meme that is this game! We don't play this game for the shooting mechanics. What makes you unique and fun is building. Revert the nerf on materials. If you're going to cap it, make it much quicker to farm. Yes skilled building intimidates newer people who can't build. Make it easier for them to learn. Put sandbox mode in, it'll help. Keep big team mode LTMs in (and for the love of God buff materials in those modes). Lastly, release save the world to everyone. No one's buying the founders pass anymore. Let people practice building there (Oh and while you're at it, add builder pro into stw and give founders what you've promised them already).

Shooting Mechanics/Balance- the blue pump was my favorite gun in the game. I'd rather have a blue pump than a scar, rpg, I LOVED it. Now I'll pass on one got a grey tac. The nerfs hurt, but I think it was necessary. I believe epic achieved what they needed with the shotgun nerf and it's just going to take us a while yo adjust to it.  While we're on shotguns, yes 9 damage is infuriating. But guess what? The other guy who killed you probably got a shot for 9 too. Yes it's rng, no it's not perfect, but at least it's balanced. As far as other guns go, epic needs to give us shooting test 2 as promised. Maybe they choose to keep the  current model. That's fine, but don't back down on what you've promised. Eventually keep LTMs like sniper shootout, silenced weapons, explosives etc to allow people to practice with these weapons. My snipe shots are always so much better after each sniper shootout. 

C4/Stink Bombs- This adds a different element into the game, just as you've purposed. And i believe it's healthy and forces people to change styles. Keep implementing things like this over nerfing current styles. 


If anyone has anything else I've missed or other suggestions, let me know and I'll update the list. Again guys, epic has shown the willingness to listen. Let's work together and have our voice heard. ",FortNiteBR

   Here is how a cap may actually be good.  Epic increases materials from harvesting.  If farming is cut in half, even a cap of 500 of each material would be ok.  It might even make the game better.  It would take far less time to get to 1500 material, which translates to more fighting.  Also, more players would gather more materials, which means winning a fight would reward you with more material.  Passive players will have plenty of material, aggressive players will collect more from fights.  Everyone wins.  

   If Epic caps materials too hard and doesn't make harvesting significantly faster, the game will burn.  I'm nervous, a lot of us are.  Let's just hope that if a cap is indeed coming, it plays out like this.",FortNiteBR

Let me tell you what their tendencies are:


-reworking stuff from top to bottom even if things would work with changes on some elements of the thing, rather than replacing said thing


-being afraid of making a game hard for newcomers, which looks to me as one of, if not the main reason for the building nerfs


-not really caring about the top players, I know it doesn't look that way, with the whole $1 Million in tournament prizes and all that, but trust me, that they're only doing this because 1. It is expected from them to be an e-sport 2. They are after that sweet, sweet e-sports money. In Paragon, they never implemented ranked during 2 years of beta, even though it is a MOBA for Christ's sake and they had a playerbase big enough to do it(or at least it seemed that way) and they straight up ignored the advice of pros even when they asked them for opinions

Next season and hopefully all the season that are coming don’t put skins where you have to grind so much to the point where it gets very boring and exhausting. Even on your website you said it takes about 75 hours of playtime to unlock everything.

**Why?**

Because we all don’t have time like the younger people. Some of us have exams all the time, some work and so on. Last season a lot of people complained about people that bought 100 tiers (John Wick) on the first day because they got the skins before them, I mean whats your problem? They deserve to have it because they paid for it and plus they support Epic Games so it’s a win-win situation for both. This community literally complains about everything. I love the game but the fact that I won't be able to unlock it because the grind is unbelievably hard for a solo player like me where the XP amount is nothing compared to full squads with BP and not everyone wants to play squads some people are more of a solo player. I don't really mind that I wont be able to unlock the final set because I wont even use the skin after 2 weeks after the season 5 release but I would still love to have it don't get me wrong but it is what it is. 

**TL:DR**

Epic games should not have grinding skins in season 5 because some people have exams all the time and other people work. Skins like the Omega where you have to grind so much to the point where it gets very boring and exhausting should not be a thing, games is about having fun not being stressed.

As time goes on, many of my friends are seeing less and less incentive to playing the game and getting wins and seem to be playing other games. The inconsistent shotgun damage, the bloom and the building clip “feature” are just some of the many things that need to change. 

The very thing a lot of people feared was what would happen when this game becomes mainstream. Back in late September-early October, when the game was still fresh and the devs were eager for our feedback, it seemed like a much better community. I understand that as the community grew, the devs are able to see less and less of our feedback as often. But it just feels like the personal touch isn’t there anymore.

It feels like the game has just become a massive pump out of weekly content at all costs, without addressing bugs and instead just “temporarily” removing them. And also, it feels like epic are almost “dumbing “ the game down, to appeal to the majority, which has unfortunately become young children. I miss receiving emails from epic games, telling me my stats, distance travelled and thanking me from playing the game. I miss the epic music from season 1, before battle pass was a thing, before tilted towers was a thing. The map feels too crowded now and mid-game is boring due to the sheer amount of early deaths due to high-interest areas like tilted towers. 

If Epic Games wants this game to survive, there needs to be some sort of incentive to winning. The battle pass has been a great start to giving wins and playing the game incentive but it feels way to “grindy” compared to last season. They need to focus on ironing out the core issues with the gameplay in this game before they moving on with adding weekly content as its leading to over-saturation. 

I know this comes off as ranty, but i love this game and just don’t want to see it go away so quickly. Fortnite needs to stay true to what it once was and do what they want to, instead of appealing to the 12 year olds. ",FortNiteBR

People think that Epic giving room for other play styles to grow are going to kill the game or kill building.

I think, however, just the opposite is going to happen. I think that by allowing for different play styles in the game, Epic is not only expanding the game but expanding building strategies.

Now I am not going to sit here and say that I know what other play styles are going to be, and I am not even going to mention possible future ones because I know I will be wrong. I, instead, want to show you guys why this is a good idea.

If you look at any other game that has a pro scheme, all of these games have various styles of play for people to use. Take CS:GO for example(only using this because it is the only other game with a pro level I have any knowledge about.

Imagine if there was only one map in CS, or imagine if every map had only one site, and one way onto the site. It would remove the strategy from the game, and would make the entire game a battle of who has better aim, or who has the better gun(I am in no way trying to suggest that having good aim and good guns is unimportant). 

Also imagine watching a CS:GO game like that. Watching pro players, go down the same path, every round, or play the same map every round. It would get boring very quickly I imagine. 

This, in many ways, is comparable to how Fortnite currently is.  

In the current state, the only way to win the game is through building, or getting lucky, and the end game boils down to who has a better gun and who has better aim. If Epic's plan goes according to suit, imagine the countless routes a player could take to getting a Victory Royale. 

Now, imagine how interesting the game would become if this were the case. With 100 players in a game(or 50 duos or 25 squads), there are 100 different strategies that different players could use. All of them going for the Victory Royale. This would also be much more interesting to watch on a pro level.

Finally, I want to say that not only will the new play styles people could take would give new players different options to try as they are starting out to see which they are best at, but the new play styles will give experienced players different play styles to try out, and would allow for an increase in the longevity of the game, because if you are getting bored of it, you can just change your play style.

TL;DR: What Epic is planning on doing will make the game more interesting to play and watch, and will allow new  and experienced players alike to experiment with different play styles. ",FortNiteBR

DO NOT be like Daybreak. 

Don’t change things that nobody wants to be changed. In short, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

By doing what you guys are doing, will literally KILL the game just like how Daybreak killed H1Z1. By changing unnecessary things, by changing the IDENTITY of the game. 

 Building:

BUILD BATTLES are the IDENTITY of the game. These crazy build off shotgun battles are what makes the game fun. 

Building makes up for the fact that we have bloom(which nobody likes in fact), but we don’t angry about it as much because of the addition of first shot accuracy and because of how building brings us closer to our opponent. 

Pre-Season 3 of H1Z1 was the identity of H1Z1. Everybody loved it despite the bugs, then they changed everything with the Combat Update. They changed everything including the one thing you should NEVER change. That being the core mechanics. Everybody hated it, they changed the identity despite what the community told them. Everyone left.  H1Z1 died. 

Don’t do what Daybreak did to H1Z1. The steps you guys are taking right now will lead inevitably to your games death and “How Fortnite Died” videos are going to appear in the future. BUILDING IS A CORE MECHANIC.

For example if you guys were to remove building all we have is a luck based BR that doesn’t separate itself from other games. I’m not saying that you guys would remove it, but its just an example. 

But changing material caps and material gain closely puts us at that example.

Nobody complained about Llamas. There’s only 3 Llamas that can spawn in a game. And more than half the time they’re rarely found. Nerfing Llamas was pointless. Now whenever you find one its like wow great, who cares? The fun of even finding one and opening it is completely gone. It might as well be removed from the game(don’t remove it, revert the nerf).

Shotguns:

The shotgun nerf made the game feel worse along with the addition of the material nerf. Shotguns were already inconsistent from the start, from shots not registering, from ridiculous damage numbers, to headshots being counted as a body shot. Then you guys nerf them without even fixing these issues. It just doesn’t make sense. 

You guys have to accept the fact that not every single weapon is going to be viable. Let’s say you nerfed ARs so the Revolver/Pistols could be used more. That sounds ridiculous. Thats just how the shotgun nerf is, to make SMGs more commonly used(when they were already good after the buffs you gave them!). 

ALSO nerfing shotguns has made double pump appear even MORE since the Tactical Shotgun is a joke now. 

Reducing the amount of rockets to 12 doesn’t make sense either. Yeah we get that explosive spam is annoying and unfun, but 12 is far too low. 

You guys already took the proper steps in reducing the chances of rockets being found in ammo boxes and reduced the chances of explosives found in vending machines, chests, and supply drops! It was great! 

But with this recent change its like you might as well remove explosives from the game. 

Conclusion:

I’ve been playing FNBR since it launched and enjoyed every moment of it. Now I’m not ever since you guys started changing things and flipping things on its head. Same thing with my friends. I stopped playing other games to consistently and only play Fortnite. Don’t make me go back to Overwatch or Rainbow, or even go back to Xbox to play Gears of War. Don’t make others go back to the other games they were playing before Fortnite. 

PLEASE revert everything back and don’t make anymore unnecessary changes.

Same thing with Overwatch.

Now with fortnite. A good quickly developed game rises to the top with almost no advertisments. Thanks to competitor Player Unknowns BattleGrounds. People enjoy it for a year. and then a problem arises. Casual players are literally unable to win in any circusmtance to a good player. Casual players in this scenario dont even say anything. but Epic games complies with themselves and change building fall off damage shotgun efficency and now they are planning MORE nerfs?

I currently sit at around 600 wins with 27,000 kills. This is a noob-friendly guide, so I apologize if you are reading things that might seem obvious. 

Lets get straight to the point:

**Where to drop:** One of the most important things when going for high kill games is choosing where you land. Landing at points of interest is crucial; however you can still land pretty much anywhere aslong as your rotations are in sync. Your landing should be dependent on bus route. Things to look for are points of interest within the first 33% of the bus route; big cities that are along the bus route in the first few seconds of departure will guarantee potential early game kills.

**Landing:** Use your few seconds of descent to analyze your area. Do a quick 360 before landing to get an estimate of how many players are in your immediate area along with knowing what direction to expect players to be coming from. When landing, I go for the best odds houses. Many cities have ideal landing spots for loot. An example of this is Pleasant Park; there are 2 houses (Dog house and tree house) with 3 chest spawns while the other houses only have 1-2. Landing at a house with the best odds increases your chances of early game survival incase someone is landing with you, you can quickly alter your goal chest instead of competing for the same one. 

**Early Game Tactics:**

* Find yourself a shotgun. Early game survival depends on quick kills as you don't have materials or shields to depend on. Shotguns allow you to use your surroundings to your advantage. Quick peek shots around corners allow you to deal high damage and take less shots without losing materials. 

Example: https://clips.twitch.tv/TastyFilthyMomDeIlluminati

* A high material count early game easily sets you up for survival. Most players within the first minutes aren't gathering materials. Just by having more materials than other players, you can escape/out build other players very easily, getting you the advantage regardless of loot and health. As you loot buildings, harvest ALL wooden furniture as you walk through (Book shelves, tables, chairs, couches, fences). 

* Having the high ground early in the game allows you to watch over other players focusing on looting. With an AR on top of a roof or building; you can take easy shots on players with no shield or materials as they run around attempting to loot. 

** Mid-Game Tactics **
Once clearing your landing city, its important to keep moving. Spend less time looting, and more time killing other players who already did the looting for you. Once I have shields equipped and shields in my inventory and 400+ materials, I begin my rotation. This is where map awareness comes in. You must factor in bus route + storm circle to determine your next location. Your next destination should be inbetween another point of interest and the next storm circle; allowing you to catch the players who survived another city and are attempting to enter the circle. From there, I personally go to areas of the map that allow me to have the farthest view distance. Examples of this are loot lake and dusty divot. By going to areas like these, you can easily view other teams hundreds of meters aware and allows you to either push them or plan for them as they rotate towards you. 

** Attracting Players **
Sometimes its easier to have people come to you. Clearing trees fully allows other players to spot your location from far. If you have a jump pad or bound pad, build a very high ramp. While building, be ready to place down a floor and a pad. Once players begin shooting your ramp, easily locate where they are shooting from and jump pad towards them, or bounce pad down and begin your pursuit. Mark all supply drops you see; when they're opened, you will know the direction of other players. 
Example: https://clips.twitch.tv/MushySolidTireYouDontSay

**Playing Smart:** You must adjust your play style to every fight as every player you go against is different than the previous person you killed. Playing aggressive is key as you need to minimize time spent in pursuing each player in order to keep up the momentum. Before pushing players, use scoped AR's, AR's, and thermal AR's to damage players before pushing. Starting the fight at a distance allows you to take shots on other players lowering their shields. This is crucial as most people won't have full shields with them, allowing you to push people with lower maximum healths. If you take any shots, you are able to heal before pushing. When you push those players, make sure to make each of your fights 1v1's, even if you are pushing multiple players. By singling out opponents, it only takes 1 knock to change the other team's play style as they will now have to worry about reviving their team mate + killing you. Create angles where only 1 player is able to see you at a time. This can be done by editing windows or placing walls in all directions but one allowing to take and receive shots only from one side. 

** End Game Tactics:**
Not much is different here. Push the players in fights. It is easy to be apart of the clean up crew late game as other players who get in fights leave themselves more exposed since there are less people in the game.

Hello Fortnite community!

So the changes that came for the shotguns like 2 weeks ago with the Bouncer patch are going to kill the game if you do nothing about it. I see people and even the pros that are starting to complain about the inconsistency of the shotguns.

People have also started to complain about to remove the Legendary Shotgun which isn't really needed if you just revert back the changes.

Now it is your choice whether you wanna keep the double pump in the game or not, but I feel like this isn't the right way.

The damage of a PUMP of a headshot should be over 100 DAMAGE at all TIMES. I'm not saying that a shotgun should ONE SHOT with a headshot, I am saying that it should deal at least over 100 damage. So like 100-160.

I have seen my headshots of my pump deal 34-90 damage these last few patches and it's straight up becoming annoying and stressful because aiming for headshots in a close up fight takes a little bit of skill.

Now this is not a rage post or a salty post, maybe a bit salty. I am chill type of person and I understand the changes that Epic is trying to put out there in the game to keep it alive, but nerfing the shotguns to the ground where I can't even hit a guy for over 100 with a headshot is not the right way and I do understand that you want to put other strategies and counterplay into the game and I truly respect that and so does the rest of the community.

If you are willing to keep the shotguns this way, I feel like you're digging yourself a slow grave. Something has to be done and quick in the next patch which I really beg for because I am tired of going for headshots and it's not dealing at least over 100 damage. There's just no point and please do not tell me that I need to center my shots directly on the head, because I got clips where I can prove that it is centered and it still doesn't deal a good amount of damage.

Anyways, I really hope you're going to listen to this Epic or at least the community, because I wanna see everyones thoughts and opinions.

Thank you,

McHappyFart.",FortNiteBR

If you can’t build or don’t like the building then fortnite is not for you, these players should not be priority over everyone else. 

Such players will be gone the second Call of Duty and Battlefield release later this year regardless of your efforts in keeping them here.

The building won't go anywhere. 

You tell me to go play something else if i don't want to see building everywhere in the game, but i can tell you the same. Go play something else if you don't like what Epic's doing with the new changes that WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN FOR FUCK SAKE.

Almost every single new thing Epic is adding to the game, is not good enough to change the meta, or to shape the meta, because in the end all that matters is who is a better builder and who use better the SHOTGUN and nothing else. Yea you can do some other stuff to outplay the JUST BUILD, but in 90% of the case is literally BUILD + SHOTGUN. 

Also for people who said ""But i spent 500+ hours in the game learning how to build and..."" BUILDING WON'T GO ANYWHERE. If you learned to build good, maybe this time around you will be more rewarded for building, as you have to know WHAT and WHEN to build, instead of spamming walls with 0 thinking strategy. So this can make it more interesting to watch, since everyone will have a different approach. 

Also, i have 5k hours in dota2 for example. I don't complain that the meta changes often. I'm always ready to learn the new stuff and play the game, because is FUN to have changes from time to time. dota2 was going through big changes even with their core game-play with a big patch by removing stats and adding talents. People complain, but people still play the game, because is the same game we all knew in the end. 

Just because you may need to think before building and don't spam walls, doesn't mean the game will be changed drastically. If you can't accept that, you're free to move on with your life and find something else. Let's just wait and fucking see what Epic is going to do with their game.",FortNiteBR

WARNING: Long post, sorry"," [So I guess epic is going to nerf the material gain even more? ](https://fortniteintel.com/2018/06/21/epic-plans-to-make-major-changes-to-the-current-meta/) I understand that some people are absolute Gods at building and that makes it difficult to win games as a beginner. But practicing and getting better is part of what makes the game fun!! I don’t know about you guys but when I started back in November I was god awful at this game.. like couldn’t even get a kill because of how different the game is set up compared to all other shooters. And one of the things that made me want to play more and honestly got me completely addicted is not being able to build or do shit! The game is so much different than any other shooter and that’s what makes it so interesting, but by nerfing materials yet again I’m not really sure how much more I’m going to play. I’ve bought every season battle pass since season 2 and completely maxed them all out. But the one thing that’s really unique about this game is when someone shoots at you, you’re able to defend yourself by turning around and building walls and stairs! And from that point the person who has the most skill (and sometimes luck) will get the kill, the loot, and get to move on to the end of the game. But by nerfing the building aspect of the game they are removing part of the skill gap players achieve by playing more and getting better, and it also makes really difficult for players who are in a tough situation to win the game (For example if you’re playing squads and your whole team dies and you’re the last player going against other squads, building will be your best chance of achieving a win). Because with limited materials they can continue to mini-gun and shoot rockets and mow you down with scars until you can’t do anything else when you run out of materials. I personally like playing the game very aggressively and pushing players, but it seems like they want us to be conservative and hide? If I want to hide and play super strategically I’ll go play PUBG. 

I believe if they introduce this playground mode that they have been talking about it will help alleviate some of the pressure that beginners have and help them refine their skills. I don’t think they should have ever nerfed the materials, and if anything they should have two different game modes. As in a mode where you need to be more strategical and less building like the direction they are heading in now, or a mode for all of the elite players with an abundance of materials to increase build fights and increase the skill gap to keep it fun for the more experienced players. We have such a huge community that I believe this wouldn’t be an issue. And by doing this it would make it easier for beginners to get into the game.

**Here's why:**

a. This game is not a game that makes you feel good. You don't win unless you dedicate hours and hours of your life to this game.

b. Fortnite uses bloom to determine bullet spread. What does this mean? It means that you can have a perfect aim and shot, but it can still register as a miss. This can kill you, but also ruins the point of a shooting game.

c. Fortnite is just like any battle royale game, and is dying out anyways.

d. It is accepted that this game isn't realistic. But that being said, the weapons should hold some kind of value. For example, a common tactical shotgun should not be better than a rare pump. Pump shotguns, and other weapons need to be buffed. 

e. This leads us right into the next problem. The Fortnite devs have one solution to solving these problems; adding more features. When a game like this has so many features already in it, why not work on fixing those? Instead, they add shopping carts, bounce pads, smoke bombs, hop rocks, map updates, and new cosmetics. 

f. Fortnite has so many game modes that have *so much* potential! Instead of keeping these and making them better, Epic ruins them with their ""version 3's"" and so-on.

\-When the game is so building-oriented, why would you reduce resource gain? (50 v. 50)

\---

**Solutions:**

a. Configure mechanics to give new players (your main source of users in ftp games) a chance to win

b. Focus on fixing weapon problems

c. When working out all the kinks, Fortnite will stand out among BR games

d. Level out weapons (buff bad ones or **nerf op ones**) to make this game more fair

e. Stop adding new features (and stop reimplementing old features) until some other features have been equalized.

f. As far as game modes go, stop doing things you *know* will have a negative impact on both the playability and the happiness of your users

\---

If devs read this, please make this game better for the people who want a free Battle Royale game that is fun to play. The problems with this game can be fixed, but you have to do that before they all move on to the next BR game. If you follow some of the solution guidelines, Fortnite will remain a bigger game for a longer period of time.",FortNiteBR

With the recent tweet from Epic about potentially capping resources, I've been doing some thinking about how exactly the game will play out with a change like that. 

I can totally see how the build + shotgun meta can get stale for some people, but I don't believe that capping resources will be the ultimate solution. Sure that scenario wouldn't be as prevalent, however it will have other negative impacts that could end up being even more damaging to game play.

And that is CAMPING. This is a battle royale game. Survival is the objective. People already do a great deal of 1x1 tower camping in late to end game, but having resources at your disposal allows you to play aggressive and push them if you want. If you have less materials it will force you to prioritize and play MUCH more conservatively, which in turn is going to slow the game play drastically.

Having materials at your disposal also allows you to traverse the map more freely, do to having the ability to build cover wherever you are. Without that ability, people will have less incentive to move around the map as freely. This is going to make the game play at a much slower pace and in turn make the game far less exciting IMO.

Anyway this was just on my mind, I like to hear all of your thoughts on how a change like this would change the games pace.",FortNiteBR

Epic is just nerfing materials as much as they can, this is a building game, I do not understand what is their problem with making building a less common thing.

Epic look at Bungie, they nerfed everything in Destiny 1 at the end, a lot of stuff that the community didn't want and it made the game less fun. Look at Destiny 2, they made something they wanted but the community didn't ask for and is one of the worst games I have ever played, and I was such a fanboy of them in Destiny 1.

What Epic has to realise is the reason why the current meta has arisen around these weapons and this particular playstyle is because of bloom. The current bloom situation means that a key variety of weapons are redundant unless you're using FSA:

- Assault Rifles.
- Pistols.
- Hunting Rifle.

The weapons listed above are critical for mid-range combat, but because they cannot be used normally without luck coming into effect, no top tier player is going to gamble using them in those instance, instead most players rush in with shotguns and although the shotguns have a random spread, the closer you are the less of an effect that spread has.

A variety of solutions are present to removing bloom but yet keeping the pace of the game the same.

**Solution 1:** Add a recoil based system, with the current damage drop off being in place. Recoil becomes harder to control when firing at an enemy further away, so the myth of being lasered is largely exaggerated, especially when this is combined with damage drop off.

**Solution 2:** Decrease the ROF of bloom based weapons, whilst maintaining current damage drop off. This means that those weapons won't physically be able to fire at a crazy rate to laser people but still reward people for accuracy.

Outside of bloom, dual wielding weapons of the same archtype is something which needs to be resolved and I feel as if the rocket situation is already fixed with the rocket cap being at 12. I also feel that building is fine the way it is.

**TL;DR:** Removing bloom will make a lot of weapons viable again in the game, changing the playstyle significantly in a good way.",FortNiteBR

This game was perfectly fine in season 2 but season 3 bought shotgun changes and now they are slowly becoming useless season 4 was interesting whit changes on map nice begging but they are destroying it slowly little by little.

In season 4 we got jetpacks i mean they where ok i would made them a bit more defensive so if you are in build battle so that you have backup plan if you are falling down or a less thrust up so that you cant go faster then person who builds to be to aggressive.

Shotguns didn't need nerf they where fine pump was consistent that was reason why people liked it but now you either have to go double pump to match tactical or heavy shotguns or just go LMG or SMG pump is nerfed too much at this moment there is too many counters for it its frankly sad to use it.

Loot llama didn't need nerf i would be perfectly fine if they didnt nerf it in squads but nerfed it in duos by 33% and solo a by 50% and made numbers of possible llamas spawn on map from 3 to 5 in duoes and from 3 to 10 in soloes.

- May 25th, 2017 item shop had Dark Vanguard. What does this have to do with Red Knight, you might ask? Well, Red Knight is the buyable alternative to the Season 2 Battlepass Tier 70 Black Knight both part of the *Fort Knights* set. It has only appeared during Season 2. 

- Dark Vanguard is the buyable alternative to the Season 3 Battle Pass Tier 70 Dark Voyager, both part of the *Space Explorers* set. It returned out of its themed season, which led many people to believe Red Knight could as well.

Here's my theory; since Epic loves to rotate skins about once every month or so, (except for Red Knight lul) the June 25 item shop featured section will be: 

- Dark Vanguard and the 2 shuttle gliders in one section

- Red Knight by itself in the other 

I really hope I'm right, or else I don't think it will ever come back. This would be an opportune time to put it in, the hype for the skin can't go up any further, so many people ask for it. How much longer can you let them down before they don't care anymore?

I think I was off of work that day, but I remember getting stupid excited seeing it in the store. The anticipation of getting a free battle royale game for the PS4 had me on edge until it came out. I was originally a PC gamer (and still am) but sadly my computer broke a while back, and because of cryptomining (which has gone down recently) I was not able to get a new one, so I stuck with my PS4. 

Finally I was going to be able to play a battle royale (I wanted to play PUBG so bad, but No PC = No PC games) and I don't think I could perfectly explain how it felt, but playing FBR for the first time, was awesome. The game felt different back then, mostly because a lot of people didnt build, and just explored the world that EPIC had made. I remember thinking,

""This game looks clean."" and it is. I guess I'm feeling a little nostalgic. 

The old music, everyone had no skin, the Tec-9 was still a thing, building wasn't used that much, new areas were super fun to explore and find new things about. After playing for so long, I don't think I will ever be able to feel the same way I did back then, but it's okay, because they were fun memories. As stupid (and corny) as it may sound, Fortnite is one of those games that has impacted my life a lot (not like *saving my life* or anything, but you know what I mean).

Yes, there are bugs. Yes, not everything works correctly right now. Yes, the game is not perfect, but its a free game that has millions of players around the world because its fun, and exciting, and just overall a good game (take that with a pinch of salt).

I'm not saying I miss the old Fortnite, because it sure as hell was not as good as it is now, with all the new innovations and items they've added and removed since then, but I like to think back about the way I felt when I first picked up this game. 

EPIC, you mess up sometimes, but overall, thanks for trying, and making a fun game that people will be talking about for a long time. Nothing is perfect, but its about the experience and about the enjoyment that really makes this game as good as it is. I'm still going to get mad when I get double-pumped to the face, or mess up and die on my own, or even at bugs...but it wont stop me from enjoying the game now, or remembering the real good memories I had when I first started playing in this crazy universe of Fortnite.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ve made some changes to the Storm timings for the Final Fight: Teams of 20 Limited Time Mode: 

Circle 1 

* Time before the Storm starts closing in from 240s to 180s.
* Time for Storm to fully close in from 60s to 90s.
* Circle size from 120,000 units to 100,000 units.

Circle 2

* Circle size from 80,000 units to 65,000 units.

Circle 3

* Unchanged.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, we fixed some cases where circles would unintentionally bias to the edge rather than the center of the remaining area.

&amp;nbsp;

The goal behind this is to speed up the pace of the early game to allow for more engaging battles as well as smooth out the transition of large circles to small ones. Please continue to give us your feedback on any of our social channels.

    b. Also retire the Crimson Scout and Scarlet Defender
2. Raptor
    a. Released in the middle of season 2
         i. Still appears in the shop today
3. Assault Trooper and Pathfinder
    a. Pretty sure they were released in season 2
    b. Part of the first batch of Uncommon skins
4. Desperado
    a. Released in season 2
5. Absolute Zero and Arctic Assassin
    a. Released in season 2
6. Circuit Breaker
    a. Released in late season 2 or early season 3
7. Bright Bomber
    a. Released in season 2
    b. Infamous for being the most common skin in the shop
8. Funk Ops
    a. Came out in season 2 for New Years 2018
9. Shadow Ops
    a. Came out in season 2 
10. Alpine Ace and Mogul Master
    a. Came out during the Winter Olympics
         i. Appeared in the shop about a month ago
11. Battle Hound
    a. Came out in the middle of season 2
12. Cuddle Team Leader and Love Ranger
    a. Came out for Valentines Day

         i. Is in the shop right now!
14. Power Chord

    b. Legendary Skin that came out right after the Rex

I think this would work well if you gave ALL skins that came out in the shop a three month shelf life, and after the three months, they’re gone. No promotions, just gone.

I see quite a few posts everyday complaining about mouse and keyboard use on console, and I agree with every single one of them, it’s a massive problem... 1 in 5 people you run into on Xbox will be a KBAM user.

This issue has been elevated slightly with the addition of Builder Pro but it’s still very much there and extremely annoying.

There’s people out there that use this device/adapter[XIM] for the sole purpose of gaining an advantage over their controller using enemies.


Aiming becomes a doddle and you can laser people from stupid distances because of AA, building is almost too easy and my controller using enemies can **barely** keep up because of the flawed design and limited functionality of an Xbox controller.

There are apparently tools that detect these 4th party devices, according to Mike Ybarra and nothing has been done.

It feels extremely unfair to use KB&amp;M against controller users, and id go back in a heart beat it the controllers weren’t so small and difficult to hold.

It absolutely blew my mind and other things that they added made me so ecstatic I played for the whole season. It slowed down towards the end, but the BANG.

Season 4 dropped. Randomized skins, customizable skins. MORE bug fixes. NEW POIs. More lore to the story, more challenges, more things that needed to be added into the game.

As you all are probably aware of, these past couple of updates haven’t been that...content filling. There were few bug fixes, few new things to look forward to, and very little content over all. In my Probably Not So Unpopular Opinion,  they are waiting until Season 5 to drop a bombshell of fixes and changes that I believe will truly change the game for the better.

And why is this a good thing? Shouldn’t bug fixes be “fixed” immediately? As far as I’m concerned, the main bug right now is the underground map glitch with shopping carts, and to say EPIC hasn’t been working their ass of for the past day or so to get it back in the game is a ridiculous statement. They have focused on nothing BUT that. Enabling it, disabling it, enabling it again, disabling it again. If that doesn’t show dedication I don’t know what does, but back to my other point.

Most of what this community wants are things that will overall make the game better to increase the lifespan of this game and make its enjoyability last longer. Button mapping, skin presets, a new redesigned item shop, set shotgun spread, more materials, you name it we’ve asked for it. The majority of the posts have amassed over usually 2k upvotes at least, and after seeing EPIC comments on posts with only 200 or so upvotes, everyone should know that EPIC DOES read your posts. Whether they want to comment on it or not for fear of spoilers or the fact that it may not be ready yet and they are afraid it will end up like playground mode (that’s another thing I want to address). 

Playground mode was announced in their State of Development post. It was not announced by any other means, and this means that you can expect playground mode to not come out until Season 5. All of their state of development posts have had things that did not come out for a while, but instead they were on there to keep the community intrigued, and aware that EPIC WAS listening to the community. Maybe on some of the smaller things, but I’m pretty sure we all wanted custom button mapping (on the post) and a way to fight our friends (playground mode).

To end this post, I’d just like to restate my original idea in case this doesn’t come across. EPIC is listening to your ideas, taking them into consideration, and then deciding on whether or not to implement it into the game. It doesn’t mean they are ignoring a good idea just because there is not a flair that says “Epic Comment”. Good things come to those who wait, and if you guys can’t wait just 2 weeks for what I’m predicting to be a gigantic list of fixes dedicating to solving issues the playerbase is aware of as well as Quality of Life updates, then I’m not sure what you guys can wait for.

As this isn’t a YouTube video, and my first attempt at trying to start conversation and possibly a debate about how I feel that this community feels very entitled (as a community who CARES about the game, “entitled” doesn’t mean spoiled), I want to encourage you guys to leave your opinion in the comments. I will respond to pretty much all of them if I can, and I will try to respect your opinion, disagree with it if it doesn’t go along with mine, and then try to have a discussion where both sides come out with new knowledge and a different outlook on the subject. I understand that being entitled to having certain aspects of this game being implemented may sound childish and spoiled, but the majority of the subreddit are people doing it with the intent to make the game they care about better. Other posts, however, have a worse way of going about things and just make “shitposts” or “fuck you epic, i want this in the game”. 

Anyway, that’s where my post ends. Like I said, be sure to leave a comment and I will try to reply to it, and if this posts goes nowhere, at least thank you for reading this far. Have a good day/night, and see you on the battle bus.",FortNiteBR

I know lvl80 is not hard but its impossible for anyone that had to work long hours every day and had hardly any time to play. I am not that good I admit but I play whenever I can. I am able to get clear all the challenges but to get lvl80 Season rank will no be possible for me as I am playing alone and do not have that much time to grind for the levels.
Please assist to change the requirements for the full omega suit unlocked as I think it will be unfair to those that do not have time to grind for the levels.

Thank you.",FortNiteBR

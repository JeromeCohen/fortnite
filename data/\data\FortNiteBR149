1,SrZiino,1544051671,a3htxa,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a3htxa/epic_needs_to_add_healing_for_getting_kills_to/,1,Epic needs to add healing for getting kills to counter 3rd partying,"3rd partying is the most annoying thing in the world, having a fight, ending it and suddenly someone comes in without letting you heal and then dying. Killing should be rewarding, getting 50 heal for getting a kill would help so much counter third partying and if the player is good he will be able to survive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how I can engage in so many fights, get into the point where I find no heals and die because of that even through I got kills but I'm weak because of rng not finding heals and the constant third partying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope Epic introduces a ranked mode with winter royale mechanics or implement this mechanic into normal modes.",FortNiteBR

Hey all,

Thanks for everyone’s help with playtesting various settings throughout the past few Pop-Up Cups. We wanted to give a quick update on where we're at and what to expect as we operate the Winter Royale NA Finals and close out the year.

&amp;#x200B;

In the next Pop-Up Cup we'll be diving further into elimination incentivization by granting resources when eliminating an enemy. The goal here is to provide an avenue for players to refill their materials by going on the offensive, especially late in a match when safely harvesting can prove extra difficult - and to generally reward more aggressive play, considering that players tend to expend resources when securing an elimination.

&amp;#x200B;

Storm Surge is an option to prevent extreme tournament scenarios where passive play is resulting in more players than desired - both in terms of the entertainment of the broadcast, and for the sake of server performance when a lot of players are alive in a very small space. Our hope is that this is required very seldomly and as a last resort, and we'll be making a couple experimental adjustments to reflect that and target a few specific points in the match.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the launch of Season 7, we'll be running the 'Explorer Pop-Up Cup' as both Solo &amp; Duo which will feature the following gameplay elements:

&amp;#x200B;

* Adjusted material cap to 700/500/300 resources.
* Eliminating an enemy player will immediately grant 100/50/50 resources.
* Eliminating an enemy player will grant +50 health or shield.
   * Fixed an issue which prevented players from receiving elimination rewards if a player they downed was eliminated by the Down-But-Not-Out timer ending or if their team was fully eliminated.
   * There is a known issue where trap eliminations will not grant any elimination rewards which will be fixed in a future release.
* Resource harvesting rate increased by 40%.
* Increased chances of supply drops in later circles.
* Storm Circle #9 now travels twice as far, but takes twice as long to close.
* Storm Surge will only activate up to three times per game:
   * If more than 70 players are remaining after Circle #2 closes.
   * If more than 50 players are remaining after Circle #4 closes.
   * If more than 30 players are remaining after Circle #6 closes.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, we'll be using the Pop-Up Cups to test limiting the number of matches each player can play during a tournament session. This has been set to an intentionally high value of 30 Total Matches to still enable the use of Pop-Up Cups as a practice environment, but we may utilize this tool more aggressively for future competitive tournaments like Winter Royale.

&amp;#x200B;

The North America Winter Royale Finals will be held using the above settings on December 11th &amp; 12th.  During the holidays we'll continue running events nightly in all regions on the Pop-Up Cup settings, alternating between Solo/Duo/Squad throughout the week.",FortNiteBR

So I logged on to Fortnite for the first time in like 4/5 weeks because some friends invited me to play. Anyways last time I played I remember having 950 vbucks saved up to buy the next battle pass. After logging on however for some reason I have only got 450 vbucks. Somehow I lost 500 vbucks and I am not sure what to do, which sucks cause I wanted to get the battle pass as soon as it came out.

So my question is does anyone know why this happened? I strictly remember not buying anything from the in game store so I can't really think of any other reason but a bug in the system.

I know Ninja gets a lot of hate but his recent rants about how Fortnite streamers often complain about the game/developers made a lot of sense to me.

I can't watch Tfue's stream for longer than 5 minutes because all he does is complain, complain and complain. Everything is trash, everything is terrible.

Same with other streamers like Symfuhny or Liquid Chap/Poach.

This game literally MADE you guys, it's given you a career and tons of money &amp; fans and you talk it down so much you're making players hate the game too? If you don't like the game, then don't play it. Simple.

It's not just that but also, seeing how they play with such a negative outlook on every situation is triggering.
- Every opponent is a ""bot""
- I died because of this &lt;insert bullshit excuse&gt;
- This guy is trash
- *dies* Woow you're so good dude wow you're so cool

These sarcastic bullshit remarks are just toxic, and annoying.
Ofcourse you can rage sometimes, as it is a competitive game but that's not what I'm talking about. For example, I love watching HighDistortion play, he can rage but overall is very positive about the game and actually HAS FUN playing it. Some other streamers i recommend are Dakotaz, CDNthe3rd, SypherPK, Nickmercs, NickEh30 and Hamlinz.


**Chill tf out bruh, it's just a game.**

So, previous 6 months, Fortnite has been a huge success. It's the biggest game right now. A number of posts have been around the internet:

&gt;Parents losing Battle as their children are addicted to Fortnite

&gt;Fortnite is affecting kids around the world

And many more like these. Many, many more.

You click the post, see the interview of a mother/father saying their kid is too addicted to Fortnite and they can't help it etc. For example, the most recent post I've seen:

&gt;Debbie Vitany is fighting a losing battle against Fortnite.

Her 17-year-old son, Carson, has been logging 12 hours a day on the video game, searching for weapons and resources in a post-apocalyptic world where the goal is being the last person standing. Teachers complain he falls asleep in class and his grades have plummeted.

Well, this is straight up the fault of the parents. Isn't it? Logging in 12 hours a day. What kind of parenting is that. I know that I can't complain on someone's parenting but this is just unacceptable. I would have never been allowed to play 12 hours a day. Few questions pop in mind:

*Why are they letting him log in 12 hours a day?*

*Why are they letting him play so much?*

*Why are they complaining if they don't set the limits?*

Furthermore, ""specialists"" are also doing their job. For example, **Lorin Marrer**, a british behavioural specialist says:

&gt;This game is like heroin.

Wow. Just wow. A question comes in my mind:

*Isn't every game like heroin if you play it so uncontrollably?*

Everything has it's advantages as well as disadvantages. Video games are no different. If you are going to sink in that much time in a single day, aren't you going to be addicted? 

I can't say much more but hope that people focus on what *they're* doing wrong. Fortnite is not like heroin, I play it, many other people play it. We are not addicted like that. 

*Thanks for reading.*

Note - The launcher only eats ur CPU and FPS if the game is running, if it's not then it barely is noticable.

Heres' the task manager comparison -

![img](ouis5slj4h221)

Heyo! With the Onesie skin being teased again and the current Burger VS Tomato war going on I thought it would've been a nice idea to design a ""Onesie"" themed skin for the Tomato side. Let the sleepover begin!

**-SKIN-**

The skin itself is very straightforward, it's a onesie with a tomato head hoodie and tomato head slippers. On the onesie itself there are pictures of pizza slices, pepperonis and the tomato heads.

**-BACKBLING-**

The backbling is a tomato head plushy with some stitches all over it and a few spots where cotton is spilling out. (Has jiggle bones).

**-GLIDER-**

The glider for this set is one of Uncle Pete's famous pizzas still hot and steamy inside the box! When the glider is deployed the lid of the box will open up and the pizza toppings will burst out and form a parachute.

(Changed the name from Special Delivery to Topping Tactic because people pointed out the Tomato Head backbling is already named Special Delivery)

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers for all the support I got on the previous post of this skin which got locked :(

Considering that most chests are in enclosed areas and that it is very rare for a shotgun to appear in a chest(Only Heavy, Spas and double barrel shotguns can spawn in chests and all of them are only epic rarity and higher).

During the past weeks i have found myself in a lot of situations where i loot around 5-7 Chests and I am not able to find any heals except bandages. The drop rates are all over the place and balloons and grey burst have an extreme drop rate..

Making it so that the minis are a guaranteed drop in chest will reduce early game RNG by a mile and make it easier to pick up and survive fights... 

I won’t mind if they remove bandages from the game because i hardly find myself using them. You can easily find a MedKit , Slurp and apples to get yourself back up and if the increase MedKit Drop rate slightly it would solve the problem.

It is truly amazing how a game like Fortnite can make someone feel their self worth with the community and have fun while doing it too.

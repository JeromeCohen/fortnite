But it‚Äôs literally a turret with wings. Not to mention you can just fly through buildings with no repercussions. Seriously? 

I think in order to make the plane more balanced i think when players go kamikaze on buildings or hit the ground, the pilot needs to take damage, along with the plane. It‚Äôs so annoying when I‚Äôm in a build fight with someone or just in a house/building and I have a plane just crash into my building and knock the other player and I down. It‚Äôs an unfair third party and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. If the pilot of the plane loses health, it will discourage this scum bag behavior. 

Also, I think if you jump out of the plane while airborne, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to dive. I think it should force you to just pull out your glider and act like a parachute.

Let me know what you think!

With all the new videos of people playing Fortnite every day, I thought maybe a rare emote of someone making a thumbnail would be a cool addition to the game.

The player would pull out a phone on a selfie stick, and snap a picture with flash of the player holding one hand to their face with an open mouth.

Phone from *busy* emote:

The other hand could be positioned on the back of the head like from the *sprinkler* emote:

The phone would be held up by a selfie stick. The phone will flash just as the player's face changes to surprise. (Mouth open.) :0 (Lmfao)

This can become a very high inconvenience in the case that you purchased for example 1000 vbucks and you have 500 vbucks on PS4, meaning that you have to pay another 10‚Ç¨ just because the PC vbucks are not longer shared with other platforms.  
Please u/MrPopoTFS report this issue to dev team to fix it as soon as possible, because this causes a very high inconvenience to customers. Is understandable PS4 policies making their platform vbucks locked, but not for PC.

Of course, so many people wanted to tell me I‚Äôm crazy and it‚Äôs not happening, which I would bet a handful of those people are the same people cheating the system and don‚Äôt want their ways to be exposed. I don‚Äôt know how else to say it but this: if you cheat the system so you can play a bunch of controller players with a keyboard and mouse: you‚Äôre a douchebag.

The FPS keeps getting lower as each season passes by, and nobody gived a **** apparently.","So, since season 7 started, I encountered :

- textures take about 15 seconds to load (while they load, somebody picks up all the loot and I get taken down)
- the FPS drops below 35, and my average FPS is 90 atleast, it is even on stretched.
- I can't stream even if I want to, the textures loading and FPS thing is making it so hard to do that
- Zipline bounced me 35m in the air and I died to fall damage, why is there is no button to press to attach to zipline?


I love Fortnite, I appriciate what Epic brings, but for once in a while, can Epic pay attention to the stability of the game, because some of us really try to get better at this, and hate when the most important thing in game loses its ability, and that is performance.

Do we even get performance fixes for PC? I think they only work that on Nintendo Switch or something else, I dunno, just feel like they should pay attention on the real issues, not cosmetics and stuff, but the game itself.

he was laughing at the top of his lungs multiple times all because he couldn't believe what Fortnite has become and how fun it is to have a Squad of 4 Planes patrolling the skies

i don't know what the point of this post was, i kinda just hope someone at Epic reads this and feels proud about the kind of fun they have been able to offer.

The B-52 Flying Fortress irl was a strategic bomber known for its thick armor and strong guns. Fort it‚Äôs vehicles usually are meant for small parties if needed so we need to neuter the original design a lot for balance. The bomber should be a slow vehicle slower than the storm wing possibly the storm wings speed without any boosters. Since this bomber is slow it cannot chase fighters nor can it lose them so to compensate for this it either needs damage reduction or a health boost, I thought about it and around 2000-2500 health would be reasonable based on how big of a target it would be. The pilot of the bomber can drop bombs by looking down with tweaked camera and lining target with overlayed reticles. The first passenger seat is in the bomb bay in here players can shoot down or jump out (this is the only seat a glider can be deployed when ejecting from. The bomber then has a nose gunner with the gun used on the storm wing for damage and building destroying power being limited by the traverse area of the nose turret needs to able to deter front assault. Finally the last seat being the roof would be a machine gun to compensate for good placement on the plane as the pilot can turn the turret sideways to shoot railing fighters or possibly even players on the ground. The planes bombs are dropped in volleys and would be normal grenade like explosions but detonated by contact with any hard surface. 

TL;DR: 4 seat pilot can drop bombs 2 turrets and exit seat

Note:  I typed this on mobile sorry and this is how I envisioned  a bomber. I don‚Äôt claim to be a balance expert. btw thx for reading if you did!!",FortNiteBR

* it seems like this bug happens more often when rushing up stairs than just sprinting on a flat surface. Building in general
* it doesn't matter if you have assigned sprint / auto-sprint to a button or not (I have tried it both ways)

I have seen people complaining about this issue in a post about the performance in update 7.00 but I cant post it, since I don't have enough karma.

The battle pass is ONE of the best battle passes we've had. Tons of good contrails, pickaxes, skins, music, pets, and weapon skins. Epic really went above and beyond here.

The map changes are a much needed change. (RIP Flush Factory) The changes add tons of more places to explore and freshen up the game quite a bit.

Epic managed to add a flying turret to the game this season and it isn't heavily overpowered. We now have tons of mobility options that makes it not so tedious to walk across the map to avoid the storm.

MOST weapons are balanced and are in a good state. Shotguns are back to being amazing and we have a good variety without feeling too overwhelmed.",FortNiteBR

If your plane is shot down, you glide safely down to the floor.

My suggestion is either you can only redeploy IF you jump out. However if your plane explodes from damage you fall to your death.

OR

If your plane explodes with you in it, you take serious damage.

I think this will balance it more.

Also the plane needs to explode if you kamikaze nose dive it at someone into the ground. ",FortNiteBR

With the nerf of mats late of season 5, Epic Games has added in dynamite to counter scrim turtling, though with this item, having it as a stack of 3, also being an uncommon item, it is way too powerful for the way it is. The splash damage on it is overwhelming against wood, and can only most likely be countered by metal builds. For this item to be balanced in the game, splash damage needs to be lessened just a bit, also damage dealt onto players needs to be nerfed, due to this item being an alternative version of the C4 to counter turtling during tournaments and scrims.  
\- Lessen splash damage on players but keep damage to structures as it is  
\- Make this item rare rather than uncommon, this will allow multiple players from having stacks of 10 on them

  
Turrets:  
This item is also the same with dynamite, where due to mats being nerfed a while ago, adding more splash and spray weapons into the game makes it so that building can't be a priority. This item is also very common to find despite it being a 'legendary' drop, making it so that, squad games are impossible to deal with this item when there are a couple players spraying this whilst others are build fighting. For this item to be balanced, there needs to be a nerf on damage and/or damage against players and structures. Or this item should be vaulted entirely.  
\- Nerf damage onto players and keep it as a counter to building

  
Grappler:  
This item has it's pros and cons, a lot of pros believe this item is way too overpowered, due to players instantly getting a free high ground card on you without getting punished. Players has mentioned that for this item to be balanced, the distance that this can reach should be nerfed, and therefore getting highground off someone might be more challenging to get.  
\- Nerf distance  
\- Lessen usage to 5",FortNiteBR

I've only seen one post about this on reddit and there was no fix, since it's 3 months old now, figure I'd try now. Whenever I'd hold W, my character would sometimes walk further than I want them to, despite me having let go of the W key, and any other key is unpressable during this period of ""ghost walking."" This is especially annoying when in a build battle, as all I can do is, instead of swapping to the wall, I'll instead shoot. I can't build above me when someone has high ground against me, I can't place a wall behind me when being shot from behind, and I'm just not able to actually play properly. Please help.

He went as far as to say that Epic should bring back the zombies from Fortnitemares, but I think that's a bit of a stretch. 

Back to our problem, I think the best way they can make getting shield a bit more reliable is to give you 50 shield when you kill an enemy (if you have full HP) and give you 50HP (if your HP bar is not full) in other words, they should do it the way (I think) it was in the Alchemist Pop Up Cup.

This would decrease the RNG factor making the game a lot more fair towards higher skill players. I think it's a change that the game definitely needs at its current state and I would love to see it in regular solos, duos, and squads. Please tell me your thoughts on this as I'm in no way a professional player nor a game developer.",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm having such a good time with this season so far and I‚Äôve played since season 1. 

They did such a good job with new content that it literally feels like a brand new and refined game to me. 

I have yet to find a real issue with the battle pass or actual gameplay and I‚Äôm throughly impressed. Good job, I never in a million years would have thought i would fly a plane in Fortnite. ",FortNiteBR

SUGGESTION:  
If you are in a plane and hit something, you take damage.

If your plane explodes and you don't exit, you can't glide. 

Cooldown happens faster, and takes longer. 

Only one per team in duos, two per team in squads.

No battle royale should have planes, its a really bad idea. The way planes have been implemented is terrible, there is no disadvantage to taking one. As you are above the plane, you are just about invincible to all bullets and then when you finally get nearly taken out you can just hop out and have whatever position you want. If people are trying to fight, you can just swoop in and take all their buildings out, killing both of them. As I realize epic will not remove the planes, my suggested fix it to put the pilot in the front of the plane so they can be shot from the ground, and if the plane comes in contact with anything it explodes, similar to battlefield. This would mean you need some measure of skill to use the planes, and they wouldn't just be free kills and positioning. ",FortNiteBR

Here's a couple that I'd like to know off the top of my head: 

 - Have I ever eliminated or been eliminated by someone famous?
 - How many times I've died to fall damage? (a lot probably)
 - How many times I've died in the first minute of the game? (again, a lot)

This is not just a problem for me but I have found a number of students online with the same issue. I have no clue how this would happen, unless the update brought changes to game files that some college internets are reacting poorly to.

The game is finally fun again. The planes are amazing the new POI are all enjoyable and the game just feels so much different to when I moved on at the start of season 5. I'd played the game a few times since then but nothing more than a single session of a few games then not touch the game for a few weeks but this season I find myself looking forward to playing and not just coming off after a few games.

Epic has really worked hard on the game and realised their identity and I feel the new updates caters to a lot of the playerbase. I know a lot of people will have their disagreements but I think Epic has done a fantastic job.

Season 1 OG who has experienced the way it has all been and honestly Epic has been amazing with response to issues and complaints from additions that weren’t so great like the most recent vaulting of an item that shall not be named or this will be delisted but mods. As well as making new items and weapons to give more variety and balance

That being said it is hardly the game I fell in love with over a year ago. It only shares the name of it. They have made many game changing not just meta changing patches over the short lifetime of fortnite that I have enjoyed as well as hated...

My biggest gripe since the beginning has to be the planes. They need to be seriously looked at and get a huge nerf IMO
     Look at the other vehicles that have been added into the game...

ATK- slow ish like 1.4x sprint speed, 4 man with a bouncer on top. 
         No damage when struck only if pushed off cliffs

Quad crasher- quicker 2 man with ability to boost, fly, break builds,  and kill enemies if boosting into them
       That was getting a bit crazy from my POV for what fortnite is and how the game is played 

Planes. Planes. Planes. PLANES. - they are 4 man quad crashers a with turrets slapped on. 

       They are ridiculously OP even with damage done upon being destroyed. They offer a ton of cover from bullets,  very fast mobility and worst of all a ton of hp that if you take no damage you can swoop and smash player builds and environment many times before breaking. 
... not to mention the noise, I cannot hear a thing when they fly over so I lose track of another player I was fighting when we get flown into

   Shopping carts are harmless and funny, rarely used these days for anything so I have no bones to pick with it but I’d like to draw comparison to how the shopping car will not protect you from fall or impact damage like the atk ... I think that’s a nice nerf for the planes. 

Not to mention how they are abused in competitive... what a way to market your game to a massive audience lame low octane aerial camping and then when it comes time just break builds of players who were on the ground fighting the whole time. ",FortNiteBR

Every decision is SUPPOSED to be a well thought and smart decision. Where to drop, which fights to take, where to rotate, and more are examples of decisions one must make to help them throughout a game. However, letting turrents and Stormwings have infinite ammo is extremely stupid. Hey, I can just hop on one of these, and endlessly shoot at a person until I decide to push him/her or start building. The cooldown timer activates after you’ve started shooting with one of these devices for 10 seconds. However, if you fire for a couple seconds, stop for a second or two, and rinse and repeat, you essentially beat the cooldown timer, because you’ll never need to have the turret or Stormwing go through this cooldown phase. What makes matters worse is that the turret does 40 damage to players and 55 damage to structures at close range, and falls down to the 30s at longer ranges. The Stormwing does around 30 damage to players and structures no matter the range from what I’ve seen so far. Oh, and it has explosive round by the way.  Does Fortnite really need plane that can carry an entire squad that has a turret with infinite ammo and explosive rounds on it that can smash through any destroyable structure with minimal risk of taking damage? The turrets and Stormwings should consume medium and heavy ammo respectively, because not only will this limit the amount of shooting one person can do with both of these devices, but it will also force the player to make smart decisions about ammo conservation, especially since Epic have just recently nerfed ammo from the ground and from ammo crates. It makes the most sense for the turret to consume medium ammo and for the Stormwing to consume heavy ammo, because of how they are used, especially since the Stormwing has explosive rounds.

[movement speed in fortnite is 12MPH](https://i.redd.it/ej2y3iei8p421.png)

The average human running speed is 12-15mph. With a 25% increase, movement speed would still be inside average human boundaries, but would also do a number of good things

* Promote horizontal peeking

in the current state, horizontal peeking (ex. through a doorway), is not very rewarding. most of the time you take the same amount of damage if not more as your opponent does. this issue encourages bad positioning. with a movement speed increase it would be much more rewarding to the people who put themselves in the rewarding positions and peek spots.

* Increase mobility

obviously with an increase in speed, players would have a lower need for mobility items, such as launch pads, quadcrashers, and other vehicles.

* Promote POIs on the outskirts of the map

with the increased speed, running from the storm is less of an issue, therefore places like Snobby Shores and Lucky Landing are more rewarding to land at, with their lack of mobility around like the rifts at Paradise

1)Bring the pop up tourney rules to the regular game modes. People have gotten much better at the game, and winning fights is sometimes a death sentence with how much health you may lose/mats you burn through. Lowering the mat cap, increasing farm rate, and rewarding mats and health for kills is the PERFECT way to incentivize fights and reward strategy. It will far more rewarding to win fights and takes some RNG out.

2)im sure you know it, planes. I think they are a fun new addition dont get me wrong. But on top of the suicide planes ramming through builds which has been talked about a ton, the third party is bad right now. Its glider redeploy on steroids. I think players shouldnt be able to dive out of a plane, just glide immediately, making it a risk/reward move. Plus all the other obvious changes already suggested (boosted damage for blown up plane, punishment for ramming builds)

3) just quality of life changes. Game is super buggy right now. I think everyone has gotten tilted playing this game, but boy is it 10 times worse when you die due to a very bad glitch. There are tons of issues with invisible loot, players, glitchy zip lines, wacky plane glitches, getting shot through builds, etc etc. 


If the game gets polished and suggestion 1 and 2 happen, this season would be the best by far. The game is great and Im having tons of fun, this isnt some whiney post. But these are all suggestions that have been floating around and i really hope they all make it into the game. ",FortNiteBR

It's really no fun winning a team fight but then being screwed because your partner/squad got thirsted by some guy desperate to have 1 extra kill when he goes back to the menu screen. People are so desperate for kills in this game they'd rather thirst your teammate and die in the process than actually try to win the fight. You can literally be shooting at someone to draw them away from the thirst and they go for it anyways.

In Pop-up it at least makes sense since you get the 50 shield/HP, but even still that's the only the person who actually got the knock.

I'd like to see thirsting removed or at the VERY LEAST unincentivized. I don't think getting a Resurrection off usually even possible in an actually fight, especially when it's duos and not squads. 

Thirsting is such a buzzkill when you're just trying to have fun with your friends. Getting the knock is the hard part anyways, that should count as the kill, so what they can get back up.

1. The punishment of aggressive players

First off, the problem of aggressive player punishment is evident in both profession and casual play. As a player who doesn't really play for wins but for kills, I am more naturally aggressive. Thus, I am put in more situations that this problem becomes more and more obvious. After pushing another player, the winner of the 1v1 is immediately put in a position of a constant barrage of attacks from other players. The weakened winner is forced to win fight after fight with not even enough time to loot. On the other hand, the passive player is almost always able to easily take high ground while the winner of the last fight is either healing or looting. In this way, I feel like Epic has their reward/punishment system flipped. The passive player who watches the fight behind a tree and pushes once someone dies is always rewarded while the winner is always punished. With more movement options like launchpads, balloons, and **FUCKING PLANES,** this problem gets even worse. 

In addition, the lack of fights happening around the map in late game causes the first fight that happens to attract the entire map to a single location. This devolves into 2-3 players build battling and the rest of the map circled around them waiting to jump in once there's one left. I feel like the Explorer Cup did a great job in trying to fix this problem by awarding kills with health but I definitely would also like to see a looting system implemented that eliminates the need to loot a kill while another player either third parties or takes high ground.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The problem with third partying

&amp;#x200B;

This problem was pretty relevant before season 7 but once again, the addition of planes turns it into a fucking joke. The time that build battles were won with quick editing and meticulous roof placement is over. The new meta is landing at a plane spawn, flying around until you see a build battle, and barreling that motherfucker straight into it and then killing the one or two disoriented players in the battle. This is such a stupid game mechanic; It rewards the ape brain player who *skillfully* flies a plane for half the match while punishing the player who actually practiced the intended game mechanics like building and aiming. Of course, planes at this point have been endlessly fucked on but this is just an example of how third partying works in this game. Of course, third partying in certain situations are definitely inevitable and good for the game but I feel like there are other situations where it could definitely be improved. 

The campiness of the game at this point is such a joke. Every pro scrim is literally a circle consisting of 75 players in boxes for half the game. In casual games, everyone camps until a chance to third party. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. The luck factor

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Fortnite's game mechanics seems to be valuing luck more and more. As an example, 90% of the time, the player who lands on a shotgun spawn wins the first town due primarily to the rest of the player base opening a chest and getting a hunting rifle. I think a youtuber named Ged said that his ideal fortnite would be no guns other than pumps and ARs for floor loot and a sniper in air drops to eliminate all luck. Of course this won't happen because Epic has to appeal to the newer audience and keep a growing player base but with the growing gun roster I have noticed more and more times I lose fights to some absolute ape brain with an early RPG or heavy shotty while I have a hunting rifle and maybe a minigun if I'm lucky.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else noticed this or am I just getting worse and everyone else is getting better?

Has Season 7 made these problems better or worse? 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk

TL;DR: Epic is valuing the passive player, third partying, and loot luck too much and I want to die. Planes super mega gay. ",FortNiteBR

Benefits: anything purchased within that season can be refunded but be wise (Previous seasons do not count those are life time)

Cons: the tickets in the season if wasted all at once you can not have anymore refunds until the next season.

Battlepass Tiers and Llamas can not be refunded with the Tickets just like the Lifetime Tickets.

I'm extremely casual with BR (and tbh, am terrible at it), but I had a blast with (and fighting against) the *Limited Time Event Weapon* - in Rumble. Hell, this and the planes led to be buying the Battlepass. And you took one out...and it's only a matter of time for the other.

I've bought other Seasons, when you guys had non-sweaty modes (i.e. Jetpacks &amp; Rockets, etc.). I didn't get a chance to mess with the Infinity Gauntlets (pre-nerf), when it looked OP &amp; fun to use.

But now you're probably going to take out planes, or make them not fun to use. I get the argument that the non-casual/competitive BR players don't want these in their matches; but it shouldn't dictate the rest of the community, having fun. Being that I bought the Battlepass, for the Limited Time Event...I feel cheated.

So why not keep both demographics happy, let the barebones players keep BR the way they want &amp; let us casuals have fun. Or cater to the one demographic &amp; refund the others, due to your false advertising.",FortNiteBR

An idea I had for double shotgun in order to make it balanced is so that the timer circle reduces the damage of the shotgun rather than disabling it completely. I think this would enable balanced gameplay as well as skilled gameplay rather than shooting 1 shotgun shot and then just spraying with an smg before the luckier player wins. I don't know how much it should reduce the damage by, maybe 25% or even like 50%? I just think it would add a fun, skill based alternative to smg spraying.

This would occur with all shotguns, although it might not be needed for a tac.

Just an idea, let me know what you think. :)",FortNiteBR

* 1000 material cap: 200 wood, 300 brick and 500 metal
* Farm rate for wood, brick and metal adjusted by -10%, +20% and +100% respectively
* Extra materials, +50 HP/shield and extra ammunition for each kill
* Glider redeploy re-enabled with the following adjustments: twice as fast as it currently is, with a larger hitbox while gliding to make it more risky to glide.
* Shooting works like in the ""Shooting Test #2"": little to no bloom, but very high recoil while aiming in.
* Planes, pistols/deagles, turrets/miniguns and all explosives/AoE weapons disabled
* Lowest available rarity from ground and floor loot is blue
* 100% chest spawn rate",FortNiteBR

Secondly : he mocks us for not being able to do 90's yet he struggles himself?
Thirdly : he has to press 2 keys on a keyboard to the equivalent of us on console having to hold a controller and using analog sticks etc lololol

Lastly ima finish off by saying what about ghost aydan? Nick mercs? Ceeday? Fearless? Console players that are more entertaining and better then him at building.

#This weeks topic is: **Planes**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Planes to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* Do planes provide a better or worse advantage when in combat against ground opponents?
* How do planes affect the flow of the game in terms of rotations?
* Should the damage output of the planes guns be adjusted, if so, in what way?
* Is the availability of finding them too much or too little.
* Should planes be able to do significant building damage by direct impact, does this need balancing in anyway?
* Should players be dealt a set amount of damage when colliding with structures, if so, how much?

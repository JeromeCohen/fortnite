When I was young me and all the other kids would get hyped about new games coming out like every month.  There was always something to look forward to around the corner.

I don't see that anymore.  I have many nephews and nieces and they are all hyped about Fortnite battle pass and new game modes and what ever.  They never ask for new games.  For two years it has been Fortnite!  It almost completely absorbed the young adult market and because of that we aren't getting games like we used to.  And because of it's popularity and major success with its monetization other game companies are doing the same thing!  Much worse but still!  Bethesda, EA, Blizzard have launched terrible game after terrible game trying to clone what Fortnite did while many other companies went out of business from lack of sales.

do you: 
A) Build on that meta. Creating new weapons that could work well with it or that have mutual properties that people will also love.
Or
B) Take their favourite toy out of the game and force them to play with new toys you think are fun and when you find out they‚Äôre mostly playing with the weapon that has the most similarities to their taken away toy (big surprise) you nerf the spawnrate so they can‚Äôt play with it anyway.

I‚Äôm talking about the pump and the combat shotgun btw. Maybe slighty hinting at the double pump mechanic since people still miss it and think it was a lot fun but ONLY slighty since it is HIGHLY controversial and I don‚Äôt want to get my fingers burned.

Then I see a black screen. Just a black screen on the launcher. I have been trying to login for 12 hrs now, no luck. I have The launcher installed on other devices as well. When I tried to login there, same thing. I have looked up everything on internet and tried everything. Nothing helped. I honestly don't know when I can login and play Fortnite. I am not hopeful that this will be fixed on the next launcher update since not many people (definitely not the  streamers) are facing the problem. I am super upset about this. I contacted the support team but they will probably suggest the same old solutions. 

I am just sick of this now. How can something as simple and crucial like login can not be fixed on a launcher. Everyday Epic is tweeting that they are aware of some bug/issue. I say it right here right now, Epic's technical team is full of bots. Simple. 

   I can't express how upset I am right now. Having the battle pass, more fortbytes to collect, more challenges to complete is the worst part. I guess I made a terrible mistake by logging out. Great way of penalizing me, Epic. ""Who Loves Fortnite? We love Fortnite"". What A Joke!!!!!

Can anyone suggest a different game I can move onto??

I'm still new to this whole Reddit thing, but my son was in a serious accident involving a dirt bike 5 days ago and has suffered major brain injuries due to multiple strokes and damage. He cannot breathe on his own and is on a ventilator keeping him alive. For father's day I am going to have take my boy off the ventilator and say my final goodbyes as he passes away.

He was a huge fortnite fan and gamer. I too am a huge gamer just never played fortnite. His dream was to make it big in tourneys or YouTube which we were planning on starting called ""papa grizzly and panda"" but due to the unfortunate circumstances will never get that opportunity. 

My question is. Is there anyway as a final goodbye, send off and immortalizing of his name is possible by a moment of silence or salute of some sort...? His name is Malachi southern, he is 12 years old and his gamertag is savagepandaboi0 I have never really posted much on Reddit but as one final wish to my boy for father's day and amazing collaboration like this would mean the world to me, his mother and family.

My name is Josh southern if you need to look me up on Facebook or if I'm even able to apply a link I can but my last post was removed. I just really want to do something special for such an amazing boy.

I‚Äôll try and make everything as civil as possible but this game is really in a frustrating state right now.  Around the end of season 7 was the best state Fortnite was in (except the planes and ballers) hp per kill was one of the best additions into the game but from there it started to go downhill.  And In March they added ballers and took away hp per kill , From a competitive standpoint the ballers are horrible when arena first came out everyone was camping in ballers late game, hell even Ghost Bizzle qualified for the World Cup using no weapons and a baller. Hp per kill was removed just for the casual players like they play the game once a week the whole community was in uproar about it, that‚Äôs around the time I took a break for a month or two because the game wasn‚Äôt listening to its community and I can guarantee at least 10 of my friends quit Fortnite for good because of hp per kill being removed maybe there was a few more factors playing into them quitting but hp per kill was the last straw.

    Epic trys to spice the game up by adding new weapons/vehicles but that‚Äôs the reason why the game is getting less fun to play, Most of the community don‚Äôt like the weapons your adding like seriously a PROXIMITY rocket launcher epic is trying to appeal to Casual players. Anyways we are talking about the pump next, of course the pump would have a high kill rate (the pump had a high kill rate so they removed it) in any game shotguns are one of the most used weapons instead of vaulting the pump you should of vaulted the tac a very low percentage of people even like the gun plus the combat shotgun has a fast fire rate it would of made more sense to vault the pump instead of having two fast firing rate shotguns btw I‚Äôm calling they are getting rid of the heavy sniper next because it can one shot 

That felt good to get off of my chest and epic your hardcore fans people who play the game for 4 hours a day are the ones buying skins and supporting your game not the casuals",FortNiteBR

&gt; Having a really high fire rate and hitting for 120 at point blank range aiming correctly and being almost useless at any other range like it was is enough to make it balanced and working as legendary/epic Tac Shotgun.

# Heavy Shotgun

‚Ä¢ Add a Silenced

‚Ä¢ Reduce the number of pellets to 7

‚Ä¢ Reduce the pull out time (switch to this gun faster)

&gt; These changes would make it a better option to shoot and build or shoot after quick edits. And the silencer would make be a nice feature for people who want to reduce the chances of get third partied.

# Pump Shotgun

‚Ä¢ Reduce the quantity of Pumps to just two variants (rare and legendary) instead of 4 variants like before

‚Ä¢ the legendary variant being only available on hotspot drones, Chests and airdrops

‚Ä¢ the rare variant being only available on loot floor and hotspot drones

‚Ä¢ Reduce the damage to 85/100

‚Ä¢ Reduce the range by 10%

&gt; These changes would make it very hard to one Pump people and would be a middle point between every shotgun, good damage, average range. Pretty much the good old pump action shotgun from every shooter.

# Combat Shotgun

&gt; I think this shotgun is ok in the current shotgun, after adding all of these shotguns, the Combat would be the most solid option, low headshot damage, high fire rate, precise and high range",FortNiteBR

Look at this chart below.  


This game held it's popularity until Season 5, at which point it dropped like a bad stock.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6idn2iim8k431.png

That big dip, before this huge dip, was done in Season 5.   


The subsequent rises are Season 7 and Season 8.  


See Epic, you think you're keeping this game fresh but you're really just making a lot of garbage decisions. Removing the pump/nerfing the pump has never rewarded you. And you did it again like idiots. Every decision you have made since this season has started (Season 9) has been a piss poor decision. You should've kept the momentum.s.  


If your corporation had any real sense of leadership, you would've reverted the pumps to how they we're in season 3, and not create a noob pump with this 3 pellet minimum bullshit. STOP LOWERING YOUR SKILL GAP. Make the game fair. Create systems to help beginners become adequate enough to hold their own online. But stop this lazy shit.  


You would foster creating a competitive but fair game, one that teaches new players how to play (Notice this game still doesn't have a fucking basic tutorial), and a fun game with the RNG factors and the Battle Royale factor.  


Epic, you can do what you want. But when you decide to fucking take this game seriously. You better keep it going. You can't afford to make mistakes anymore. You made too many. You better keep the momentum going.  


P.S. If you look at the chart, season 5 was when this game dipped. But if you really look, it was a chance for the game to reach new heights. AND YOU BLEW IT. Look at how it was healthily climbing until you f\*\*\*ed up.

~Traps~

Damage Trap:
-DMG
150‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-&gt;75

Mounted Turret: Very very very very very very useless item. Just vault it and leave it that way

Chiller: The chillers were amazing for mobility if used correctly and I think they should be unvaulted. They weren‚Äôt broken and we‚Äôre pretty fun to use.

Bouncer: The same thing goes for bouncers. Good mobility and amazing for hitting trick shots. Unvaulting  them would be amazing. 

~SMGs~


Drum Gun: 
-Mag Size
50‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&gt;40

Submachine Gun (grey, green, blue one from season 5)/Compact:
-These SMGs were actual SMGs. The grey green blue one didn‚Äôt do a broken amount of damage and had a lot of bloom. This was the only balanced SMG and the compact was balanced for an SMG but maybe have a lower mag size.

Burst SMG: Along with the addition of the Sub and Compact the burst SMG should be vaulted. It‚Äôs nothing like an SMG and does way to much headshot damage.

~Shotguns~

Combat Shotgun: Easily the most balanced shotgun in the game since the beginning. The only thing that I think could be nerfed is the range. It has the range of an SMG and I think they should be nerfed.

Tactical Shotgun: The most inconsistent gun in the game. It‚Äôs hated and no one likes it so it might as well just get vaulted.

Pump Shotgun: Although it could one shot someone with max everything it was still a good shotgun. Unvaulting it would be amazing and would please a lot of people

Double Barrel:Heavy Shotgun:
The double barrel could shred people at close range with a double 144 headshot and the heavy was a good gun overall so unvaulting they wouldn‚Äôt be bad.

~ARs~

Infantry Rifle:
The infantry rifle is a very useless gun so vaulting it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem

Burst Assault Rifle:
With the vault of the Infantry Rifle the burst assault rifle unvault would help the game. Getting a burst first gun compared to an infantry rifle is a huge difference.

~Snipers~ 

Semi:
Horrible sniper if your going to go through all the trouble of sniping you might as well use a suppressed version or heavy. I think it should be vaulted 

Hunting Rifle:

I'd like to start off with saying this is not my idea at all, and I know a lot of people have wanted this for the longest time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of people in the community would like to see a female black knight skin or an edit style for red knight.

&amp;#x200B;

TSM Hamlinz was talking about the idea of that skin and his chat all agreed with him.  

Clip:  [https://clips.twitch.tv/OpenSuperCheesecakeRiPepperonis](https://clips.twitch.tv/OpenSuperCheesecakeRiPepperonis) 

&amp;#x200B;

This skin looks extremely cool and I would love to see it in-game. From Season 4 until now we have gotten a female Tier 100 in the item shop. Even though its 7 seasons after Season 2, I still think a lot of people are wanting this skin as a female counterpart to Black Knight.

 

I fully believe this skin would sell extremely well.

I'm big in leveling up, getting battle stars and working my way up in the battle pass but I also enjoy these LTMs like Horde Rush and Downtown Drop, so the only thing that stops me playing them more is the lack of XP granted. and it doesnt have to be a whole lot.

With enough RNG and Good circles, we could even reach up to around 450k-500k Squad points! Which is WAY more than you even need, but if you're struggling to get that 200k needed, then this is for you.

&amp;#x200B;

**DROPPING**

Where we droppin' boys? Well, in this game mode you don't have to worry so much about where to drop, as you start off with a pretty slim circle. So, your drop is pretty much decided, however... shortly after landing, your circle will start to close, so it is recommended to land on the outer circle and loot, working your way inward, that way you can maximize your loot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**LOOT**

If you don't get a whole lot of great loot, that's ok... you'll have chances to get more loot later on, and the first circle is pretty easy to get through. I racked up a ton of points one game with just a silenced pistol. Just keep an eye out on ammo. At first it might seem like you have a ton, but in this game mode, it goes FAST... soo... pick up everything you can, and be sure to help your teammates with some if they need it. The better equipped you are all around as a team, the higher potential score you can get. Also, looting chest and ammo boxes DO give you points, so grab as many as you can.

&amp;#x200B;

Your load out is up to personal preference mostly, but ideally, what works best is high spam items that have low reload times. Since ammo does become an issue, you want to get weapons with different ammo types to make sure you don't run out of ammo at a crucial moment. Here is what I recommend and why:

*Combat shotgun:* Out of any weapon that can take shotgun shells, this is your fastest and most reliable weapon. It reloads pretty fast, and can one shot most fiends with one shot and can easily spam it in tough situations. Plus, it feels great just tearing through them pumping them in the head as you run along. 

*Tactical AR:* This weapon uses light ammo and tears through fiends with a fast reload. Most smgs that use light ammo either require reloading way too often compared to the Tac AR or like the burst AR, Just doesn't compare to DPS when faced with hordes running directly at you.

*Minigun:* This is a great substitute weapon for Tactical AR. It does have a cooldown that you have to watch for, but it's a good time to switch to another gun and then break it back out. It does go through quite a lot of ammo, so make sure to hit your shots and don't just spray it randomly. If you can, it can earn you some INSANE points. One of our first games where we achieved crazy points, it was with this minigun. My allies did make sure I had plenty of light ammo, while maintaining their own stock. 

*DrumGun:* This is your best choice for medium ammo. It tears through fiends insanely fast, and while it does have a significant loading time, it isn't enough to break your streak (More on streaks later) which is SUPER important. A regular AR is great choice too if you don't have a drumgun, but because the fire rate is faster on Drumgun, it gets a much higher dps on the hordes, and makes it easier to tear a lot of them down at a time. AKs have a slower speed overall and is not recommended unless you have no other better option. 

*Rocketlauncher:* Out of all the explosive weapons, this one gives you the most precision with significant number of kills. Grenade launcher is nice if you don't have rocket launcher, but the randomness of it can be unpredictable unless you try to aim it carefully, and you DON'T WANT TO WASTE AMMO! Rocket Launcher is also great for kiting the boss later on (More info on that later). Grenades are also useful, but face a similar situation to grenade launchers. A nice tac I like to use with grenades and launchers is box a group in, toss a nade and ramp up and out, while the fiends explode. But you will want to do this fast to avoid damage and don't accidentally put yourself under your ramp. Do at your own risk. Clingers are nice too. Help out a friend who is close to a horde and toss a clinger on them to blow up any fiends around them. Just make sure they don't come running at you. lol

*Shadow Bombs:* These bad boys are your best friends. Make sure everyone in your party has a couple just in case they find themselves in a sticky situation. Using one of these will immediately drop any aggro on you from the fiends. (NOTE: Remember that using one of these WILL reset your kill streak multiplier. Use only if you absolutely need to!)

Traps: Regular traps are nice. You can place them on the ground and they are likely to not get destroyed by enemies. Put them near purple pillars to have enemies run through them. Ice traps do spawn in this mode but aren't super helpful. TURRETS ARE SUPER HELPFUL! Grab them. You'll use them in static circles. I'll explain why, later.

*Things you might think you need but you absolutely want to avoid:* Stinks are useless. Fiends move around too much to take any real damage from stinks, and in the moving circles where it is small, you risk damaging yourself with them. DON'T BOTHER. Heals. You will not need heals in pretty much any situation. Your shields regen as you kill fiends, and you should be ALWAYS killing fiends. If worse case scenario comes about, you an pick up a random slurp as they drop pretty abundantly and they are easy to quickly drink. Don't grab anything that till take too long. Half pots are nice, but you probably won't have time. Take a mini if you need to, over this. PUMP SHOTGUNS/HEAVY SHOTGUNS yes, do a lot of damage, but when it comes to speed, they don't compete with the combat. Grab a tac if you need to, but don't expect too much. Your priority should be a combat. Boombow. This is nice, and you can easily kill several fiends with this at a time, but if you miss ONE shot, you will almost likely lose your streak, which is a big NO NO. Boogey bombs are fun, but not optimal and you can hit your teammates or yourself and cause streaks to be lost. LMGs seem great, and they are while they are active, but the reload time is so bad that you'll lose any streaks you have. Not worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

(Boomboxes rarely spawn, but are usable on pillars and distracting the horde momentarily. Not super necessary, but nice.)

&amp;#x200B;

**COMBAT TIME!**

STREAKS STREAK STREAKS! The BIGGEST FACTOR to getting high point games of Horde is to KEEP YOUR streak multiplier going. To do this, you simply need to keep killing. If you are near to losing your streak, don't target that brute... target the smaller guy, and then go for the brute. You do NOT want to miss a streak. If your timer runs out, you will drop to 0. So many kills will get you a x2 multiplier. More will get you x3. But the sweet spot is 45 kills. After 35 kills, any other kills after will grant you x4 points. Keep this going for as LONG as possible! AIM FOR THE HEAD! Aiming for the head does a couple things, and it is worth it to try to hit them there. 1, It kills them faster. 2, Killing them faster means more ammo is spared. 3, HEADSHOT GIVE MORE POINTS!!!! The only breaks are when you start a big circle, and when you end it. The big circles, we'll just call Static Circles are different from Moving Circles, which are smaller and well... moving... Static Circles have the weird purple glowing tech in the middle of it. So when you start a zone and when you end a zone you'll get a break. ANY OTHER TIME YOU ARE SHOOTING! I'll get into the difference between these two in a bit and the different strategies required. The main thing you should take away though, is always trying to keep your X4 KO Streak. This is one of the easiest ways to get high points. Also, if it wasnt' obvious... don't get cornered. 

&amp;#x200B;

**THE ENEMY**

There are many types of fiends in this mode. I don't know exact names for these so I'll give you an idea of what they are and what they do as well as what they look like so you can keep an eye out.

Normal Fiends: These are your Every day fiends. Easy kills one shot. Dark Purple in color

Tossing Fiends: These ones throw glowing purple energy at you. Bright  Glowing Purplish in color Easy Kills

Poison Fiends: These are orange-ish in color They are easy to kill, but BEWARE! upon death, they release a cloud of stinker like spray. These don't come up too often, but they are there and they ARE annoying.

BRUTE  Normal fiends: Bigger. Dark Purple. Hit a little harder, have more health.

BRUTE Explosive Fiends: These are SUPER annoying. Stay away from them when they die, cause they explode and do a lot of damage! They are similar to normal brutes but are distinguishable by their glowing light purple, similar to the tossing fiends. Thankfully, you won't see too many of these, but enough that they can be triggering if you aren't careful.

BRUTE GOLDS: Gold in color, BIG, HIGH HEALTH HIGH DAMAGE! If you see one, it's usually a good idea to let your team know so they can send some helpful fire your way.

THE BOSS: Looks exactly like a GOLD BRUTE, but does about 50 damage per hit, And has a HUGE health bar. You'll know it's him cause the final circle will have a PURPLE PILLAR where he will erupt from and his health bar will come up on screen. This will be the 3rd and final Static Circle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Static Circles**

These are zones where you are pretty much in one spot. The FINAL zone is similar to this, but with a few adjustments I'll talk about later. Much like rest of this mode, you do not want to be fighting the same hordes as your allies. You want to spread out and get as much damage dealt as possible. At first you'll be together cause only one Purple Pillar will appear. But more will arrive shortly after. Spread out, and try not to get caught between 2 pillars where you can be easily swarmed. If your pillar is slow at spawning, move to where there is more action. Don't waste time. Take hits at your pillar between fiends, so you can destroy them. It is not required to destroy these but these give points and are also affected by your multiplier when destroyed, and can drop gold chest that can give you nice items or AT LEAST ammo. Meanwhile, it is a good idea to dedicate one person to keeping an eye on Team Multiplier Crystals. They'll show up on your minimap when they spawn and usually spawn on the outer edge of the static circle. ALWAYS GO FOR THESE! Have a teammate dedicated to getting these. If you get swarmed, pop a shadow bomb to lose aggro and you can even pick them up in shadow form. These will greatly add to your points. Always look for these while in static circles. 

This person will also try to clean up anything targeting your turrets. 1 person typically on a turret and then the others fighting pillars as mentioned above. Keep an eye on your man on the turret and replace his walls an floors below him if they get destroyed. You'll want to place your turrets up high to avoid getting hit. If you are aware and making sure you are hitting your shots, you should be able to keep most of the horde at bat. Turrets are also GREAT damage against pillars and are one of the fastest ways to destroy them. Just keep an eye on overheating. Take pauses if you need to. Taking pauses takes less time to cool down than overheating and then trying to cool down. But if you do overheat, make sure you immediately target a fiend to keep your streak. The cooldown is short enough that you can kill a fiend, cool down and kill another just in time to save your streak... as long as you have one in target. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Moving Circles**

Moving circles are where you can seriously rack up points. The fiends just keep coming, while you're moving. Make sure to keep an eye on any ammo that drops, cause it's at this point that you can easily run out of ammo. You'll want to focus on different groups from your allies to maximize damage and points. Be ready to build and keep an eye on terrain, cause very similar to end game situations in normal games, hills and declines can sneak up on you, and you could end up taking lots of storm damage. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR STREAK GOING! There are so many fiends that come at you during moving circles that it should be impossible to have your streak broken as long as you are keeping your eyes open and aware at where enemies are coming from. Coming down hills, be watchful of fiends below you stuck trying to come up at you and out of line of sight. And if you are near hills, check for enemies stuck up on hills for easy kills. Explosives can be useful here as they usually come at you in big groups. 

&amp;#x200B;

**FINAL CIRCLE**

Final circle is very similar to Static Circle. The only difference is you'll have an extra role that needs to be fulfilled. It's helpful to have someone with a rocket launcher who can kite the boss and keep it's aggro. Why do you need this? If you are looking to really maximize your points, when you enter the final circle, you want to do as much damage on the boss as you can, getting him super weak. Have someone looking for crystals as usual and a turret is nice, but make sure not to shoot the boss with it and get his aggro. He'll destroy it and it'll be useless. He breaks builds super fast. Once you get the boss super weak, focus on wracking up streak points with random spawns and destroying pillars if you can. Once the circle gets close to completely closing, that's when you focus the boss again and finish him. The person kiting the boss should easily be able to keep his multiplier up as well, hitting random fiends that gather around the boss. Just try not to get hit and killed while doing so. A dead kiter is a bad kiter. (Kiting is the act of running around and letting the boss chase you while your team fulfills other objectives)

This LTM mode is one of the hardest. Not only every challenge needs you to focus on it alone in every play but you need to play the LTM multiple times for that and the time won't be enough. We always drop with a squad that have team members leaving at the startof the game or midgame which decereases the chances of winning.
Not only winning alone is not that easy (almost impossible) but winning without dying is really out of this world.
Let alone that in the last challenge we need to Win with a team score of at least 50,000 in stage 1 got this after multiple timeswith a try hard team after dying many times)
To my big surprise I was expecting stage 2 to be a completely different requirement, yet it just doubled the amount required.
Stage 3 and stage 4 go even beyond that which is beyond what any try-hard can do.
Ok you will say that score multipliesr may help but who is even caring about them to collect them? I am always the only one trying to gather them yet husks are after me and I can't collect most of them since the team isn't helping at all to secure my back or at least trying to get some by their own.

So please tone done that last challenge to  more reasonable requirements or make it just one stage. The other challenges are already hard enough to get during this limited period. Even normal gold brutes don't count as a kill for the other challenge and only the defated last boss counts.

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

The game mode is easy enough there's just one problem. The final boss has too much health.

I saved up over 18 clingers and landed everyone of them and the boss is only half health. 

There aren't enough viable spawned weapons in this game mode and it really kills the endgame.

Traps are useless as they are slow, the turret is useful but your a sitting duck, yeah you can build up but the storm in the final circle moves too fast and makes planning a harder.

Not enough accurate explosives are in this game mode, I've only seen the bow in 2 games and even direct hits that deal 200 damage is just a tiny itch to that boss.

If you keep the streak going all the time (you have 5 seconds to kill the next zombie) you alone can get &gt;10k points after the first round, &gt;25 after the 2nd, &gt;50 after the 3rd and &gt;100k beforde you even face the boss. And remember that when you pick the team multiplayer your streak keeps going because it kills all the nearby zombies. 

Another tip is avoiding playing Haunted, Fatal and Snobby, because during running stages you need to go through the hills and then you have no chance to keep the streak going as some zombies spawn behind you in the zone and with building and running it's to hard not to break it.",FortNiteBR

For the overall team score you'll need 200k which is 50k roughly from each team mate.

It's not hard. The trick to this is aim for the head and keep the chain kills going for as long as possible. Play aggressive like when syphon was on. Technically you gain shields from each kill.

I found the best weapons are the SMG and the Heavy AR.

Lastly. When the Final Boss appears. Drop his health to critical and get kills and finish him only when storm is small.

An important technique is when you're forced to reload. Always aim for the weakest enemy to avoid the risk of breaking the chain.

I've gone multiple games in a row and always got 50+ after doing this strategy. My current record is [75,100](https://i.imgur.com/m1f9O8S.jpg).",FortNiteBR

‚Ä¢COLLECT POINT MULTIPLIERS

‚Ä¢MAINTAIN KILLSTREAKS FOR MORE POINTS

‚Ä¢SMGs are nice
‚Ä¢ARs are very nice
‚Ä¢DON'T USE EXPLOSIVES
Shoot way too slow, have way too long reloads and you'll blow yourself up, doesn't matter how pro you are
‚Ä¢DON'T USE ANYTHING WITH SLOW RATE OF FIRE/SLOW RELOAD
‚Ä¢Save turrets for the final boss, they help
‚Ä¢Don't try to destroy the Obelisks, takes too long and gives few points, just killing zombies is way better for points
‚Ä¢Grab some slurps, some gas enemies deal health damage and you can't get health back by killing zombies

I am level 106 in STW, and I loved it way more than BR. Now, I am convinced that STW needs to just move into BR with Horde Rush modes, seasonal events, etc. The few rounds I played of Horde Rush were fresher than anything in STW since Hexylvania. I think we would have a better game in the future if we just let STW get adopted into BR instead of fighting off the inevitable. Give the STW vets exclusive items, vbucks, etc during the transition. Soon, they'll have those free goodies and an even better zombie game to play. Implement traps and builds and soon Horde Rush will be a better version of STW. We might even get a finished product!

I wanted to address a potential fix for the current state of shotguns as per my opinion. Just a little disclaimer, this is only a **suggestion** and what **I** personally think could work for the game. :)

* As it is, shotguns aren't in a good state, and this is common knowledge for anyone who plays regularly. Tactical shotguns cannot face combat shotguns due to the strength differences and combat shotguns remain hard to find. In general, unless you have a combat shotgun, it's unlikely you'll win a fight against a combat shotgun. This makes the tactical shotgun unappealing despite the fact that it could be a powerful, handy little gun if looked into further.

&amp;#x200B;

* Removing pump shotguns from the game was a mistake. I'm not going to be one of the players begging to ""*bring the pump back!!1!1!*"", BUT I do believe that a return of the pump shotgun would balance shotguns further. My suggestion is to bring back the pump shotguns in the green/blue variants and the combat shotgun would fall into place of the purple/gold variants.

&amp;#x200B;

* Tacticals should remain in the game for the players who struggle with pumps and accuracy, but they'd stand a better chance against shotguns if **a**) the pump was added back as a balanced shotgun, **b**) the tactical was strengthened, or **c**) another suggestion I've seen floating around is replacing the tactical with the heavy shotgun, or at least adding the heavy shotgun back. I was never a huge fan of the heavy shotgun, but this could also work!

&amp;#x200B;

* *Don't even get me started on the state of SMGs in the game*. Burst SMG who? This gun has no place in the game and can't stand a fight against a shotgun. I'm not sure I've come across anyone who thinks the burst SMG fits in the game and stands a chance against any of the other guns. Maybe adding back one of the past SMGs would also be beneficial in fights against a shotgun.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion (**TLDR**): Tactical shotguns need to be made stronger and another (stronger) variant of the shotgun should be added in the lower tiers (green/blue), while the combat shotgun remains in the purple/gold variants (blue would be removed, the other shotgun would take that place). Right now, the mix of a little, teenie-weenie tactical shotgun and a very powerful combat shotgun isn't working for the game. Fights are very hard to win.",FortNiteBR

Pretty self explanatory. No one uses it.


**-Vault Mounted Turret**
Pretty self explanatory. No one likes to play against it, no one likes to play with it, no one likes it general. Most people just drop it so it wouldn't make trap switching more difficult.


**-Vault/Nerf Boom Bow**
A lot of people want the Boom Bow to get vaulted, and I see their reasoning behind it, but with the weapon being released not that long ago, it would be a shame to get it vaulted even though the concept behind it is really cool. An alternative to vaulting it would be to nerf it in a way which nerfs its splash impact. Either remove splash damage in general forcing you to hit the person right in the body and not the ground, or make it so if you shoot the ground then that would result in less damage- damage falloff of some sorts.

**-Unvault Heavy Shotgun**
Pretty self explanatory. People want it, and more variety in Shotguns is obviously needed.


**-Unvault Bouncers**
Pretty self explanatory. People want it, and let's not forget that Bouncers by themselves have given birth to many 'clip worthy' moments. Bouncers follow a mechanic of 'easy to use, hard to master'. Any player will find it's basic use, but only more experienced players will be able to distinguish scenarions in which Bouncers will shine the most. That is what is best about them, and why they must come back into the game. Probably out of all the things that need to get unvaulted, this is one takes the 1st place.



**-Unvault ATK vehicles and shopping carts**
There was no reason for them to get removed. They are not weapons, so they don't clog up the item pool. Yes, they are not particularly good, and in general are very 'casual' things, but I feel like we need more of that casual stuff during times where everyone is a sweatlord. For crying out loud don't remember how much fun you'd have driving an ATK with your squad, doing dumb shit and everyone having a blast doing it?


**-Make it so Combat Shotgun would also have a green rarity**
Combat Shotgun was suppose to be Pump Shotgun's replacement, so it would only make sense to have a green rarity as the Pump Shotgun had a green rarity, while currently the Combat Shotgun doesn't. This would as well make Combat Shotguns more widely available, and from I've heard from the community, that right now would be kindly appreciated.


**-Melt down the ice area**
All the ice areas that got added alongside season 7 are pretty underwhelming. Happy Hamlet gets total of 3 people landing there if it's a hot drop. That's pitiful. And we all can agree that we wan't Greasy Grove back.


**-Bring back rifts to Viking Village**
Viking Village is one my favorite locations to drop if the bus is right next to it at the start, but some time ago they decided to remove rifts that were surrounding the village. There was no reason for them to get removed.


**-Bring back pop up cup faster material farming**
This is probably a stretch, but here goes nothing. With the removal of pop up settings from all non-competitive gamemodes, the discussion that it brought up made it so that faster material farming was overshadowed by siphon, and in result not really talked about. It doesn't matter if you are a casual player or an experienced one, you need mats to play this game, and no one dedicate half of their game to farming mats. If anything this benefits the casual players more as they will be less likely to go into fights, thus will have less mats because the people rushing each other will have more mats as they kill a person and take their mats.",FortNiteBR

For one, it‚Äôs definitely better than the suppressed sniper, can‚Äôt argue with that. Still, it‚Äôs nowhere in the same class as the heavy sniper. 

You can‚Äôt one shot somebody with the boom bow, the splash damage isn‚Äôt even that big, and despite having the laser sight, it doesn‚Äôt zoom in like a sniper and thus, a 100+ meter kill is significantly harder with the gun...idk about y‚Äôall but I can‚Äôt see people that far away without a scope. 

You can‚Äôt use the weapon close range otherwise you‚Äôll just do damage to yourself, the gun doesn‚Äôt do ANYTHING to structures, making it arguably the easiest ‚Äòexplosive‚Äô weapon to counter. 

Arguably the only OP part about the weapon is the fact that it uses shells as opposed to rockets. Still, with shotguns being virtually non existent, it‚Äôs questionable if you‚Äôll even find any shells to begin with lol. 

The RPG has a ridiculous splash damage, the grenade launcher can be spammed and is practically impossible to counter if you land a few grenades in the same radius, and the proximity grenade launcher...well, I don‚Äôt have an opinion on that. 

Idk about you guys but I‚Äôll always take a heavy sniper, grenade launcher, or rpg over a boom bow. It‚Äôs a legendary weapon, it‚Äôs supposed to be better than 90% of the weapons, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs overpowered. The thing is arguably garbage now with the 1.25 second reload time. Also doesn‚Äôt help that you have to charge the gun to get distance and in a game like this? You‚Äôre essentially a sitting duck.

* If you kill someone, they're not eliminated from the game. They spectate you until you're killed
* If you get killed, everyone you've killed drops back onto the map with full heath and shields
* If the person who killed you gets killed, you drop back onto the map with full health and shields

However, they gave always reverted/nerfed certain items within a short time period.

First, they decide its a good idea to let a bunch of children decide which over powered weapon should be unvaulted and they all go for the drum gun (which was nerfed) yet the boom bow remains in the game where the only joke of a nerf was to add a 0.5 reload time. 

But then they take it further and remove it from team rumble which is the most casual game mode there with respawns.
Then they add the proximity launcher 
They decide team rumble should have the best loot out of any game mode. 

Most of my friend have stopped playing because if how frustrating it is to die to a combat shotgun when you only have a tac or nothing better.

Now we're at a point where playing a game in pubs and not finding a combat shotgun then dying to someone with a combat shotgun is common. 

Not finding a combat is also very common. 
The tac is a dogshit gun and often gets you killed. 

So what the hell are epic doing? Do they just want us all to play team rumble because I don't know about anyone else but team rumble gets boring after 1 or 2 games.

Okay so I have an iPhone so no way in hell am I gonna go buy a new phone just for a skin. I tried doing the store method and honestly it was just so much time wasted. I also asked at my job if anyone had the s10 sadly they didn‚Äôt. 
So I decided to get creative. I went on to the Offer up app. (Offer up is an app that allows you to buy and sell items locally) 
First I looked for anyone selling an s10 but I filtered my search so it only shows me people in a 5 miles radius, also I only clicked on profiles who verified their accounts with legit contact info and that also had good fee back from previous sales. So the first one I saw I messaged him and straight up told him what I wanted to do. Since he was local if needed to I could drive to him and do it myself, but he was real cool with it and said ‚ÄúHey no problem man I can redeem it for you if you‚Äôd like‚Äù so since he‚Äôs a verified seller in a 5 mile radius I felt okay with this. So before I even gave him any of my info I made sure to have my laptop with my email opened up Incase he tried to change any info on my account, so I proceeded with giving him my info. He even put in his own card info to redeem purchase but it gave him an error code but the purchase said ‚ÄúPending‚Äù sure enough 2 min later Ikonik and Scenario were on my account. He then messaged me saying ‚ÄúHey man not everyone is like me I‚Äôm an honest one. Also you can go and change all your log in information. Glad I could help‚Äù I offered him 20 through Zelle but he didn‚Äôt accept. Some nice people still live in this world.",FortNiteBR

I understand that Epic are finally trying to cater to the casuals after catering to the sweats for so long, but they're going about it the wrong way. Yes, we need broken items to kill the pros but we too are also suffering from the poor RNG you've created. We cannot find shields and actual good weapons to even defend ourselves but you insist on adding in broken weapons that are in the rarest variants that we can't even find. You should start by fixing the abysmal spawn rates of these junk items (Burst SMG, Grey tac &amp; Grey AK) so we could find decent weapons and shield to even survive the first minute of landing. It's absolutely unfair when you land and one person was lucky enough to find a combat shotgun and would go on to clear the entire POI because no other close range weapon can compete with such a broken shotgun. Epic, fix this horrible RNG fest, you're turning your loyal customers away from your game.",FortNiteBR

This is the worst loot pool the game has ever had, the guns are not balanced,  the spawn rates are questionable, and the mobility is off the charts. Plus there are a ton of weird bugs affecting gameplay. Here is what I would do to make the game fun again: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Shotguns:**

The combat should have never been put in the game. It completely dominates the meta and they would have to nerf it heavily to make it balanced. 

\- Remove Combat 

\- Bring back the Green and Blue Pump and nerf max body damage to 95 and max headshot to 195. 

\- Buff TAC damage by 10% or so and make it slightly better from a distance to compete with pump.

\- Bring back the Heavy Shotgun 

&amp;#x200B;

**SMG's:**

\- Vault the Drum Gun and the Burst SMG. 

\- Bring back the silenced SMG and the Tac SMG and give them a small DPS nerf. They went from completely disregarded to maybe a little overpowered IMO. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Assault Rifles:**

\- Vault the Heavy Assault Rifle and Tac Assault Rifle, bring back the Blue Burst and FAMAS. The Tac AR isn't bad but I don't see a real point in it. There are already enough AR's and enough SMG's. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Snipers:**

**-** Vault the Semi-Auto Sniper and Cross Bow 

\- Nerf Heavy body damage to 140 max 

\- Bring back the regular Bolt. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Explosives:**

\- Vault the grenades, dynamite and the proximity grenade launcher. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Miscellaneous:** 

\- Bring back bouncers and shockwave grenades, remove the rift-to-go and the storm flip. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mobility:** 

**-** Get rid of the APEX skypads, the slipstream, and geysers. The mobility is insane right now and is leading to a super aggressive META and a ton of 3rd partying. Put a guaranteed hoverboard and ATK spawn in each POI so you can rotate but with some level of risk and you can't fly around on top of people. Remove all the other vehicles besides the hoverboard and ATK. Increase launchpad spawns slightly as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Make these changes and we should be good to go : )",FortNiteBR

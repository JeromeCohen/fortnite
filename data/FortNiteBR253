Square is also the button to purchase something in-game. obviously I wasn't expecting for this to register as me purchasing the skin, but it did.

I'm now stuck with the skin, because my lifetime refunds have been used up and support is giving me nothing but an automated response (which isn't even for the right issue. it's only telling me that I can't buy something once it's left the shop).

look, I really enjoy this game, and I want to support Epic, but this is so horribly anti-consumer. the lack of a ""confirm purchase"" option is very unethical to begin with, especially when you only get a limited number of refunds.

The fact that you can only to level 50 and not devote much time, but can still get full ragnarok seems pointless. 

The people who do grind and get it before other people do, by mid season 6 won't have anything to show for it.

Making it so you're required to reach a minimim level of 70 would keep players playing and working towards a goal, but not burning them out on the game.

If you disagree, don't downvote but provide your opinion on it. Players should have something to show for their time devoted. ",FortNiteBR

Noticed someone else is using my epic games account to play Fortnite and need to get my account deleted and completely disconnect my PSN account from any epic games account it's connected to.

---------

I logged onto Fortnite today on PS4 after not playing in a while and noticed that my account was leveled up and things were different. I looked at my Epic Friends list and seen that I had ""friends"" I didn't recognize. 

After seeing this I logged into my epic account and I changed my password and disconnected my PSN account. Unfortunately this meant that I lost all my progress and everything I've purchased but right now I'm more worried about someone having my information.

I have two epic accounts and I've checked both, and changed the passwords on both. The problem is that someone keeps changing the password again on at least one of my accounts and it's kind of freaking me out. I'm not getting any alerts that this is happening but when I change the password back myself I get the email. I also tried to relink my PSN account back (on both of my accounts) and it says it's already been linked (I don't know if this is just a glitch or if someone has claimed it).

I've already submitted a request to Epic to delete my account(s) but I'm worried they may gain access to my connected PSN account. If anyone has any info (or if Epic sees this) it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you",FortNiteBR

You guys just eat up anything that comes out of Epic games ass. There’s really people on this sub who think this is the greatest game ever. 

Then there’s those who say dumb shit like “no other dev puts this much love into their game.” 

Here are some devs and games that are far superior to fortnite in every possible way:

Nintendo and any of their studios. Just look at breath of the wild, super mario odyssey or smash bros.

Naughty Dog and all of their games. Beautiful and well written games with 10/10 mechanics.

Bethesda with Fallout and Elder Scrolls. Sure the games are buggy but they have 100x more content and detail put into them than fortnite. 

Hell even CoD is better. Refined shooting mechanics, actual player progression with challenges for skins and weapons instead of charging for simple recolors. 

Epic games supports Fortnite yes. But they do nothing special. Every company ever supports their product until it is no longer viable. 

And epic will stop eventually maybe even next year when all you kids move on to the next trend. 

You can like the game, there’s nothing wrong with that, but please stop praising it for the dumbest reasons, like adding back blings to skins. Do you guys seriously love back packs that much? Geez.",FortNiteBR

4. Replace Loot Lake with more useful location. 

5. Replace"" serach chests in... "" challenges to more creative and game educational ones. Mby something like build 0/[?] structures or collect 999 wood/brick/metal in one game. 

6. Permanent playground mode. 

7. Instead of trying to make game ""noobs friendly"" just add some tutorial that new players must complete to compete with others or make elo based matchmaking. 

8. Make the last inventory slot only for meds and let it be like the trap slot in Building so you can change between 50s/minis/slurp/med kit/bandages. 

9. More ammo from ammo boxes. 

10. Add emote wheel in lobby.

My top 10 things are 
1) Remove pump delay. Now that double pump is gone (and rightly so) I think it’s time we remove the delay from switching to a pump from any weapon besides shotguns and build mode. 
2) MORE LTM’s! It feels like months since we have had an LTM besides Playground and big team modes. I don’t mind them in the game but atleast also have other LTM’s such as solid gold and Blitz. 
3) No more building nerfs. When Blitz first came out everyone thought it would be great if Mats were buffed to be similar to Blitz. What did they do? The exact opposite. Like 6 people of this sub actually don’t like building but the other 800k actually like building. Epic usually have a good record of listening to the community when it comes to change but they seem to like how building is RN even though there are many complaints. 
4) Bigger item shop? Okay this sounds pointless but with more and more skins, emotes, pickaxes, and gliders coming to FortNite, 2 more slots on the daily shop wont hurt. 
5) Some love for the deagle? This weapon is kinda useless at mid/long range. Could we please remove damage drop off on it? 
6) Also wouldn’t mind an increased spawn rate for launch pads. I know they got an increased spawn rate a while ago but they are so fun to use and it is a shame that they are hard to find. 
7) Recoil/shooting test v2. Okay I know adding recoil into the game straight away will be bad. So why not introduce shooting test V2? Bloom will be removed completely and will be replaced with recoil. If people like it, add it in. If they don’t, then at least we know that bloom is better.  
8) Playground changes (Thought I would put this in as one). Playground is probably the best LTM but who said it can’t be improved? Stuff like the ability to save and share maps, extended playtimes, replays that save even if you quit so you don’t have to wait an hour for it and also disable enemies name tags on it (probably a glitch so will be soon) 
9) Impulse grenades from April fools? Impulse grenades are in a healthy state currently but April fools was the most fun I had in this game with the impulses. 
10) And finally.....actual challenges. I don’t mean like time consuming challenges like the search chests ones (which are a pain on the first day) maybe challenges like eliminate a player with a sniper rifle from over 180m away or Eliminate 3 players in one match before the first storm closes in. Not really good examples but you get the point.

Anyone feel like the smg meta is worse than the shotgun meta ever was? Not really being able to build effectively if someone has a p90 gets frustrating but I’m open to change. ",FortNiteBR

1) When u go to edit mode not having to touch 2 times the botton to build. Yes I know u can hold it

5) Make shoutgun great again 
6) Reduce the bloom radius could be a bad idea
7) Bringe the scythe back JK
8) Put a cool down on the mini-gun
9) vault the GL won’t happen ever

These are why.","I'm not trying to get attention, but there are a lot of things Epic can do to make this game fun for me and many others again. I really don't want to leave.

- Irrelevant guns
Not a lot of people actually use the LMG, Scoped AR, Thermal AR, Hand Cannon, etc. Because these guns are either variations of better guns, or just not worth the time. Why are there so many unnecessary guns? Every gun should make someone go ""I can win with this."" Instead of ""Time to find another chest.""

- Explosives
They're meant to simply keep people from building too much, or do group damage, if an explosive like C4 or Clingers just become terrible or overpowered on every change made, why keep them?

- The same map is dull
We needed a new map in Season 5, constantly changing the current map is not going to keep players in. 
A second map would make people become more interested. I was very disappointed when the dusty region became a hole, and all we got this season was a golf course, desert, and a viking place, really?
You can't keep adding and replacing stuff on the same map so often, the current map is oversaturated, please just make a new map.

- When half of the game is just hitting stuff with my axe, it gets boring. Farming materials should be much quicker and not a majority of the game.

- Stop nerfing the buildings, the entire point of this game is that it's different from other Battle Royale games because of the building mechanic, embrace it! But not too much.

- There are way too many skins now.
More often than not are skins only in twice after two months from release. We **need** a bigger shop, or at least less skins/cosmetics in general. I'm really not feeling these new skins, they're forgotten within a week and not brought back for half of a month.

- Playgrounds is amazing, but a full on creative mode (adjustable loot, storm, healing, etc.) would be a great addition!

- Please support your actual game, Save the World. I paid $40 (others paid up to $150) and the bi-weekly updates are depressing to look at. BR is a cash cow but at least make some more fun things like perks and making farming easier.

- There's no incentive to win. For some this isn't a big deal. But winning after your first 3 wins isn't very special, and it isn't very fun anymore. Even a *very* small vbuck reward such as 10-25 VBucks will be good enough. You'd need 8 wins (rewarding 25) to get the cheapest item from the shop, a green emote.

- Battle Pass customization needs to be about win counts, or kill counts, not XP/Grinding. Grinding Season 4 unsurprisingly made me disinterested in playing the actual game after getting max Omega. It killed the game for me really, now I don't even try to play because it's just not something I enjoy.

- From here on out, *these are some things that epic can't control that have ruined the game for me as well.* This is just personal and not at all Epic's fault, just wanna point that out.

- The community, it consists of either
A) Tryhards who go for those ""sick high kill games bro!"" and mindlessly just kill everyone no matter what.
B) 8-11 year olds that beg for meaningless virtual skins in a video games, scream and ask if you have a mic, and generally make the game look like the next Minecraft.
C) Streamers/wannabe streamers, I guess since there are a few successful fortnite streamers, EVERYONE thinks they'll be the most successful streamer too. Streamer mode has killed the chat, half of the people aren't even getting stream sniped, so it's really unnecessary to have streamer mode unless you have a modest following. 
Plus, these streamers have encouraged the tryhard behavior.

This game is going downhill for me. In 2017 it was super fun being a noob, where no one built a multi-million dollar mansion anytime you shot a single bullet near them. Epic, please fix the stuff that you can. Hopefully the toxic parts of the community die out and I can hop back on.

And I know you can’t make everyone happy I get that, but to be honest with you I would rather double pump be rampant than have nerfed building materials and a constant spam from two teams with smgs. 

You don’t have to agree with me at all that’s fine, it’s just frustrating when you out build someone and most fights they disengage and knock your build down.

Maybe it’s because shotguns are pretty pointless to carry when you can carry a drum gun and switch to a p90 both with 50 round magazine. Also shotguns got nerfed to the ground. 

I just wish epic would stop lowering the learning curve and catering to super casual players. “gO PlaY sOLo shOwDOwN” well it’s just as rampant in there as it is in casual. My whole problem is why keep nerfing the main purpose and what made your game unique and fun.

Your glitched lobby skin is from STW and is not new nor is it coming to BR. Also, your different body/head combo glitch looks cool, but nobody cares... we’ve already seen it. 

2. Shotguns, smgs, and building are currently unbalanced and Epic is constantly working to come up with a fix that satisfies the majority. Until that day arrives, adapt and overcome. 

3. I know that when you scream at your parents to let you buy V-Bucks, they normally cave to your demands. However, screaming at Epic and posting huge rants won’t change anything. Constructive communication and reliable feedback on the other hand, will. 

4. You coming in second place was not the result of a game-breaking bug. You either got outplayed or experienced a minor connection issue. There are bugs in the game but they are not detrimental to your success. Also, it is impossible to completely eliminate lag in video games. 

5. Your gameplay clips are impressive, but nobody wants to subscribe to your Twitch/YouTube. 

6. SMGs are the current meta. This will eventually change as it has in the past. Fortnite is a very dynamic game and you are going to struggle if you are resistant to change. 

7. It is very frustrating when things don’t go your way in a game. A lot of things are changing that people are used to and it takes a little practice to develop new strategies and play styles. Epic wants Fortnite to be fair (for the most part) and fun for everybody. In order to do this, they need to test and implement new things for people to try out. As new things are released into the game and mechanics change, it is important to remember that these are not meant to cater to “noobs” or hurt “pros.” Eventually, balance will be mostly restored and each weapon will be viable in different types of fights. But for now, keep grinding and focusing on your weaknesses and you will notice that problem lies within yourself, and not the game.

I personally can’t stand the stretched resolution, it makes the game look ugly and hard to watch so I won’t go out and watch someone’s stream if they choose to play like that. 

I understand the “competitive advantage” it gives, same way that playing with shadows off gives you a “competitive advantage” but at least turning shadows off doesn’t make the game look horrendous, it’s still nice to watch it’s just a bit brighter. Abusing this isn’t something that Fortnite could control, to my understanding.

But for the Fortnite Tournaments it should not be allowed to stretch your resolution. Not because it gives players an advantage but because it’s just an eye sore to go back and forth between a beautiful game in an amazing resolution to a stretched out disgrace. These tournaments need a better way to spectate these games and give viewers an overall amazing experience.

I try to go up at them and then shoot, and then build if it gets too bad. But then I end up dying. I’m trying to get into the habit of building when I see someone. And then what if I build and shoot them, but then they start building too, and it gets complicated? I don’t really know what to do in those heat of the moments. I’m also aggressive.

What they also could do is wait until November/December so that they give the players the opportunity to play those other games for a little bit, but then a month later they will drop the map and bring everyone back. Maybe people will be burnt out by October so this will give them a break and then they’ll come back to a fresh new map and attitude!

It’s extremely frustrating to open up this subreddit every day to see “suggestions” to Epic about implementing certain things into the game that are unnecessary. There doesn’t need to be a house/fortress/POI in every section, corner, and mountain top of the map. There don’t need to be more chests to help increase your chances at completing challenges or to increase your likelihood of getting a legendary weapon.

Yes, the skill gap is quite large at this point for the new players compared to those of us who’ve been around since S1, but that’s why playground mode was implemented. Yes, you can use playground mode to have fun, but if your only using it for that, and then crying to Epic for more help, then that’s your fault. Playground mode should definitely be used to help improve your game. Everything is buffed, so you can spend countless hours working on your building mechanics. You can use it to explore the map and understand it better. You can practice your aiming against your friends. UTILIZE THAT. 

Look, the rest of the player base also had to go through “growing pains”. Not everyone was already good from the start. Not everyone knew how to build from the start. For myself personally, I didn’t get my first kill until like 27 games in. My K/D ratio didn’t turn positive until like 1400 games in. My win rate sucked. Anytime I got to the top 2, I’d physically start to shake from thinking “oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit” and then I’d choke. But I continued to critique my game play, didn’t make excuses, actually practiced my builds and aim, and I’ve gotten much better. I went from a complete mobile player, to average, to above average now. But I didn’t do that within a day, week, or even a month. It took SEVERAL months to get to my current level of play. I didn’t have a playground mode. I had to queue up games and physically teach myself how to build in the middle of games. Some days you’ll have a good day. Other days it’s like you can’t kill a single person. Some games bloom works in your favor. Other games bloom doesn’t allow you to hit a shot and you get lasered. But that’s where you can use playground mode and even 50 v 50 to practice the little things to get better.

Being a good player isn’t about having the best load out from the start. I’ve won plenty of games starting with a crap load out, as have others. Being a good player comes down to the fundamentals, not just having epic and legendary weapons the entire time. Building, aiming, making the right decisions, confidence, staying calm and collected during intense battles, are just a few examples of some of the little things that go into making you a good player.

It’s just annoying when I see people feel like they’re entitled to get a victory royale, or their entitled to be a “good player” without having to put in the work. Streamers had to put in work to get where they’re at. Epic didn’t just hand them the tools to be automatically good. Same goes to the other skilled players in the game. 

This game is no different than anything else in life. If you want to get good at it, then you put in the time and effort to do so. If you have other obligations that don’t allow you to put in as much time as someone else, then of course you’re not going to be as good as that other person. Stop asking for handouts to make you “better” like the guy who has actually worked at it. This sense of entitlement is ridiculous. Suggestions that actually make the game better as a whole are fantastic, but suggestions that only cater to your specific wants, make no sense. 

I get that this can be a tough pill to swallow for some people, but again, this concept applies to life as well, not just video games. Things don’t get handed to you. You actually have to work hard to get to where you want to be.

A lot of us are aware of the removal of the Double Pumping mechanic at the start of Season 5 with shotgun draw speed delays as a nerf to counteract this.

""After firing a shotgun, another shotgun cannot be fired for a very short time."" -Epic (v5.0 Patch Notes)

This was the second nerf to shotguns we had seen recently with another one only updates before.

""Pump Shotgun

* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
* Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85
* Tactical Shotgun
* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0"" - Epic (v4.3 Patch Notes)

This update was designed so that being able to one pump was impossible and the damage was lowered to try and stop people from using a double shotgun load out or making it harder to use one. I honestly do not in the slightest see why this is now needed or even a thing since they have removed Double Pumping completely and this just acts as a double nerf. SMG's are fine as they are right now with the most recent update but they need to focus on the shotguns now to bring more balance. I would 100% rather use an SMG than a shotgun now all because of this. I always get around 5/6 pellets hit every time and can only do 30-40 damage because of how low a bodyshot is now. And this is at a close range build fight. This needs to be addressed. ",FortNiteBR

I was one of the few people that actually gave it a shot then, and have been stuck on it since. It was a much simpler time then when 1 wall and 1 stair would almost certainly be an automatic win. When the guns were just right after the fix of the RPG. Double pumps were unheard of and shotguns did major damage. Fast forward 5 months and most people are able to build at least a 1x1, but the top guys could build whatever they pleased as quick as possible. This made a huge skill gap between those two types of players, as there was not a whole bunch of weapons to shoot down structures and the person that could build usually won every fight. 

Fast forward to now, shotguns to no damage, double smgs are way better than shotguns could dream of being. The LMG has 100 bullets that you can sit and hold down the trigger. C4 blows up everything in its path and you can stack it in 10s, the p90 has 50 bullets that mows down and building. Mats have been decreased by a small amount. This seems to me that they are trying so hard to make this game more biased to the noob. For me, I’ve put in all this time and effort to get better at building and improving myself as a player, while epic hands these noobs guns/equipment that they can spam at my walls with no sense of awareness, just simply to shoot. Many of those billets sadly hit me, and I continue to take fall damage more times than I can admit. 

I just wish they would make this game more simple, and stop trying to cater to the noob audience. Keep playgrounds in the game permentantly, so the newer players can learn how to build and play properly, and if they don’t utilize it, it’s their fault. Stop making the skill gap smaller. Thank you, let me know what you guys think. I’m open to discussion! ",FortNiteBR

(How to fix shotguns.),"     Basically right now I see no reason for using the pump over the heavy shotgun at all, and the tactical usually puts out higher and more consistent damage than the pump, so here's an idea on what I think would be an easy fix.

     An introduction of a brand new shotgun, a double barrel shotgun of sorts. It would work with only 2 shots before reloading. (Obviously) but the catch is the 2 shots can be fired similarly to how firing double pump use to be, in quick succession. It would have a relatively long reload to negate spam and would have the same damage as the current pumps. (80 and 85, maybe less)

     With this addition the OG Pump shotgun could have its 90-95 damage restored giving it that slow firing risk but high damage reward.

     I'd like to hear any thoughts on my suggestion

Tl;dr
Add a double barrel shotgun and fix the pump's inconsistent/unreliable damage.

I’d love to play Fortnite and buy all kinds of outfits and stuff and have a group of friends who would, too, except we all dislike the building aspect of the game. 

Fortnite is optimized so nicely, I just wish you didn’t have to build. I read a while back that they were making a “no build” mode. I’ve searched google and it seems that isn’t true?

Is it just too much of a core mechanic to remove? Have they had temporary modes that require no building? Are they implementing “no build” at all? I can’t seem to find any information. I’m just an old fart who is bad at building but would love to play Fortnite without the extra building mechanic. ",FortNiteBR

When you shotgun at an enemy it gives unpredictable damage, from the dots you can see it is randomized.  
It doesn't need to be randomized. Spread each bullet out evenly in the crosshair and spray them at a slight angle outwards. This will give you a skill-based and balanced weapon. It will do more damage close range, and it isn't down to plain luck.  


2, storms:  
Imagine there are 3 people left, 2 people are next to eachother and 1 person is far away. Instead of the next circle being random, it should go around the 2 people fighting (the majority) and leave the 1 person camping (the minority) in the storm. This would make the storm much more efficient at doing what it should do, which is to speed up games and increase action.  


3, voice chats:  
It would be nice if Epic added an option to queue only with people who have microphones.  
I can't believe they haven't implemented this yet.  
4, weapons:  
Fortnite needs to lose a few weapons. We do not need multiple Snipers, Rifles and pistols.  
Having such a huge weapon pool only makes the game more random and luck-based.  


5, SMGs:  
The SMG meta is horrible.  


6, Building:  
Fully built wooden ramps should not fall to 2 pickaxe swings. There is little point in building anymore, especially with the tiny amount of materials you get. Someone with a minigun &gt; Any building. If building needs to be weaker than my aim, Epic should atleast give us the materials to rebuild after someone spams a minigun.  


7, Accuracy:  
Fortnite needs to drop all RNG in accuracy. Instead there should be predictable recoil patterns to all guns. This means if you are bad at the game you will miss more shots than someone who is good at the game.  


8, Consumables:  
Chug jugs and boogie bombs need to go. They are just too much of an unfair advantage to anyone who finds them.  


9, Loot:  
Rarer loot should be more common in more popular areas, this would make landing in obscure locations less viable, which would increase action. This would also guarantee someone going into a popular location and coming out alive some good loot for the rest of the game. There also needs to be some sort of loot guarantee, too many times have I ran around finding nothing but ammo and shields.  


Why hasn't Epic already made these changes? Epic is interested in short term profit, which is why they are doing everything they can to lower the skill ceiling, this attracts casuals, which brings Epic a lot of money. The problem Epic fails to see is once the next 'new thing' is out, all the casuals will leave, and the only players Fortnite will have left are those that Epic loves screwing over.",FortNiteBR

A separate lobby for &lt;10 solo win players would help noobs L2P, and provide a nice mix of bushies, amateurs and novice builders. It would also keep more new players around, increase average skill level of the other lobby, and allow Epic to increase the skill ceiling for better players.  

Smurfing (pros on alts shitting on noobs) may be a problem, but it will be rarer and besides, pros are doing that _now_. With this system, instead of pros always making pancakes out of no skins and bushies, it will only happen sometimes.

I am going to say that I’ve watched a couple of IDropz's games for the tournament and it was sketchy as it wasn't your normal console games. But on NICKMERCS side it looked a little normal to me. NOW IDK IF IT'S NA SERVERS OR EU PLAYERS ARE BETTER IDC ABOUT THAT. People have been saying console players are trash and let me clear it up.

Bots
The first thing is the so called “bots” in fortnite. They’re pretty much the name for really bad players. Now in console there are bots alright but not as much compared to PC. If you've watched Friday Fortnite you’ll rarely find good squads or people that know how to play as a squad. Most players on PC aren't as great and IMO dumb. There are alot of pro players on PC but they are all famous or have some recognition. The only recognized pro player for console was NICKMERCS and Noizey to some extent.

Skill Gap
There is alot of variety for unfair play on PC Gamers. On console , everyone has the same specs , etc. But on PC , people have different PCs meaning if you have a strong good PC , it's easier for you. But not all people are that privileged and 
they dont have good PCs but on console everyone has the same console and same controller (EXCEPT SCUF) which makes the playing field even compared to PCs unfair factors. That’s why there is more bots on PC. Even more factors on PC are the keyboards and mouse. Monitors however do apply for both sides but console the monitor capped at 60Hz while on PC its unlimited which once again is unfair play. 

Controller
The level of play is balanced also because of the controller. It's harder to build using a controller and requires more skill. BUT ON PC KEYBOARD AND KEYBINDS MAKE IT CHEESE EZ PZ TO BUILD. And shotgun accuracy for controllers is trash not gonna lie. 

THIS IS WHY CONSOLE IS HARDER THAN PC AND PC IS EASIER. THIS ALL APPLIES AND WOULD BE EVEN MORE TRUE IF EPIC DIDNT ALLOW KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SUPPORT FOR CONSOLE. DUMB MOVE ON EPIC'S SIDE. IF YOU DO YOU KB AND MOUSE ON CONSOLE JUST WANNA LET U KNOW NO ONE LIKES YOU.

Since mobile is generally looked down upon by the community, it is not at the top of epics agenda to fix these issues I know many players are having. If players on PC or counsel were having these issues, Epic would be on it right away, but since this is on a lower skill platform, these issues are overlooked. Fortnite is Fortnite, and it shouldn’t depend on the platform you play on. Why should the platform you play on matter whether the bugs associated with that platform get fixed or not. I love this game and all of the employees at Epic for what they do, but I may have to take a break because of the state of the game until it gets fixed.",FortNiteBR

Suggestion: 1) HALF THE HP OF THE ROCKET. Movement has extremely little to do with it, turn speed is very little, the HP is the only stat that actually matters. Potentially I'd double shotgun damage to it, so there is an actual counter in game.

2) DOUBLE the range you can hear it from.

If epic introduces this weapon AGAIN, and it's STILL disgustingly overpowered, many (such as myself) will be extremely upset. More so because of the spray meta you're enforcing.",FortNiteBR

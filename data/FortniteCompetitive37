I feel like they're used for no skill kills or now to break stairs for when people are turtling. What place do they have/have they ever had in the game?

Mounted turret damage doesn't even correctly reflect that the player is being damaged as the damage to the turret is also white. Can barely hit the player unless you have silenced AR, AK, Deagle or Scar and that's with great aim/luck with bloom. Can't outbuild it even with the cooldown nerf.

The only strategy I've had any success with is inching my way closer and closer to reduce the effect of bloom but even with this i'm taking a lot of hits from the turret as I move closer. Running away is an option but sometimes it just isn't and you're still going to be taking hits if they're decent with aim/tracking.

tl;dr Turrets are dumb. How are you countering them?",FortniteCompetitive

Playing on straight console against PC is straight up unfair. This post isn't about controller versus mkb, but about straight performance stats.

On console performance is so piss poor compared to PC. Console is locked with maxed out settings, shadows, no res changing (nothings can be done about that but its worth noting), horrible input lag, motion blur, and the biggest killer, being locked at 60 fps **with dips and multi-second long stutters.**

As for PC, res can be changed, shadows can be turned off, res can be changed, you can have insane view and draw distance compared to console, no input lag, and of course, not being locked at 60 fps. Hell, most PCs can run Fortnite on low at around 100.

Epic needs to either optimize the shit out of console, make us be able to change the settings, or just split the player pools in pop up cups (save for qualifiers like winter royale). And thats not even talking about the controller vs mkb thing along with aim assist, but that debates been beaten to death. 

Epic, you've done well to try and balance controller vs mkb, and for the most part you've succeeded, but now the console itself is the problem.

PS - Anyone saying how ""oh well aydan and nickmercs compete, and they're console"" No, they're console on pc and dont suffer from these problems. This is common knowledge but i feel it really needs to be repeated sometimes.

Would like to know your guy's thoughts.",FortniteCompetitive
8,Loomin_,1546141940,aasfve,32,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aasfve/the_future_of_competitive_fortnite/,1,The Future of Competitive Fortnite,"Hiya folks, we’ve seen many healthy discussions about the eSports side of our game, and it’s something we take very close to heart at EPIC Games. Fortnite is one of the first games in which controller and mouse and keyboard players can compete with each other, and the emergence of mobile players’ success shows how great our game can be for the future of eSports. We want to keep this game competitive and at the center of the face of eSports for years to come. So we’re going to update you on what we’re doing to ensure this. 

Before all else, the players ability to adapt is the number one skill in our minds at EPIC. The glider redeploy test, the addition of the sword, are all showcases of the number one skill of Competitive Fortnite- adaptation. 

Pro feedback- Many have said if us at EPIC listened to pro feedback, we would have an ideal game. This is simply not true, we respect the opinion of pros, but they are not the game designers, we will not let them affect our game, this is EPIC’s game, not ours. 

What are we changing? In short, nothing at the moment. The amount of players that competed in the Winter Royale is a positive sign for the future. We believe that what we have made, and what we will bring, will be great for the future.

I only played like 12 games and half of these games got me killed by some BS, can EPIC please take a look at this before adding another LTM in their Christmas streak. ^(r)*^(eally loving some of the LTM's, please don't stop adding them.)* 

\- Got mowed down by a highly advanced machine of war (read invisible and silenced airplane) that only showed himself on the rader after the smug revealed himself on the wings of his jumbo jet to give me the elf. 

\- Got ambushed by superman himself, disguised as a default with his iconic red cape. Whilst flying through the air he beamed me down with his bare hands. Baffled by his mighty appearance I stood no chance to the man of steel.

\- Got tricked by my own pump like Trump tricked every Texan promising them a wall between them and Mexico. All indicators were there but nothing really happened, leaving me with empty hands and a quick return to the lobby.

\- Got absolutely kobed by some war hero with powers only to be witnessed in ancient Greece myths, throwing his nades from Paradise Palms to Pleasant Park. Words fell short to describe the impact but I got killed whilst wandering through the woods of Lonely Lodge.

\- Got smacked the living shit out of me by two players that stood above Jesus. Not only could they walk on water, they moonwalked through my fresly laid laminate like a hot knife slides through butter, spraying and praying me straight into oblivion. 

\- Got bitch slapped in the face with a heavy shotgun whilst my pump was dealing with some flashbacks to his time served in Vietnam when I eagerly edited a window in the wall between me and the enemy to deliver the final blow.

\- Got hunt down by some 3rd partying wilderbeast. After trapping the beast in my solid 1 by 1 it was time to end him like the animal he was, only to find out that I couldn't place my traps as the paint on the wall had not yet dried. 

\- Got labeled by EPIC as class A storm trooper, resulting in my bloom being the size of my 24 inch monitor while also giving me special ammo that prevented the enemy from taken any damage even if I'd mistakenly hit him 

But seriously my friend couldn't believe wat he saw being already death, we both checked the replay, my bullets just went straight through the guy and nothing happened. That was the moment I called it a night. ",FortniteCompetitive

What if Epic starts to make tournaments which require a pin to play? Maybe these tournaments would happen only once a week for 3-5 hours and would have a game limit (maybe 20?). 

They could even have a leadership on these tournaments and award prizes to the top 200 or 500 players. V-bucks, skins, dances, old battlepass skins or pickaxes, etc. 

Also having your name on a leadership would mean a lot, and the best players would actually try to be there by winning, and not by brainlessly pushing other players.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand all the hate with W Keyers. I find it's a pretty good tactic that can catch a lot of people off guard, but it also has its downside, you can die pretty easily if you fuck up. Similar to any other tactic in Fortnite if you fuck up and your opponent knows how to play off your mistake then you're more than likely dead.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say W Keying is just some peoples style of playing, it's not that they just close their eyes and run into the battle guns blazing but they decide how and when to go in. Even in the Korean Games that Tfue played in, Aimhero went balls to the wall and jumped into his box a couples times to challenge him and won both times.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of W Keying is Stewie2k in CS:GO, the Smoke Criminal. That is literally W Keying, but a different game. He knows when to go in and when to catch your opponent off guard. 

&amp;#x200B;

W Keying shouldn't be seen as a nooby tactic or a no skill tactic. Because playing to catch your opponent off guard and do the unexpected IS skillful. End of the day if you're getting wrecked each time by someone going balls deep find a way to counter it rather than complaining about the tactic. ",FortniteCompetitive

Even if you were shot down you could glide with no damage done and it would still be balanced. Adding the boost and turret is just overkill.

**How to Submit:** 

Visit the link provided above or [here](https://goo.gl/forms/J2LxxIwRLHCGUYmi1), select the region you participated in, and when it comes to the in-game screenshots you will be able to link 2 screenshots/pictures of your results from the tournament. **The most important one to link and remember to take, is a screenshot of the end of your final game showing your username and amount of points.** Example: https://i.imgur.com/BPfRvhs.jpg - The other screenshot/picture you need is of the final results showed in the events tab. Example: https://i.imgur.com/iKb8elU.jpg note: it is okay for these two pictures to be taken from a phone/camera if screenshotting is not available as long as you can see the necessary information in them. 

**Incentives:** 
The top 10 players from each region (NA, EU, OCE, ASIA, BR) will have their scores displayed within the results post with links to their socials. We will also be testing out how this works in order for us to be able to grant text flairs for users to show case their pins on next to their Reddit usernames! (all other scores will be available in the full leaderboard)

*Note: Only scores submitted for today’s solo tournament will be counted! We will also be trying out a cumulative leaderboard after this one instead of a new one each day.

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated, would help me out a lot, especially negative so I can improve. [I spend hours of my life critiquing gameplay.](http://www.twitch.tv/Conv) I can handle getting roasted. 

I've spoken to one of the mods here, and they explained that while guides are helpful, most people don't like them because it's not easily comprehensible/cool to watch.  Which I understand fully and will be working with more pros in the future to get videos out to you guys that are short and concise!

I've spent the last 2-3 months studying CN, KR, OCE, EU, NA scrims - so my guides are multiregional / multimode which I feel may dilute quality. In preparation for Fortnite World Cup, I want to only give excellent content to people who are looking to play. So that anyone, regardless of status, may have the opportunity to succeed.

I'm looking for a bit of advice for an experienced player. 

(I mainly play squads, with my friends who are less than 1KD players.)

I play PS4 and I am above average in mechanical skill. I have been around 2KD since around season 5, although I know I'm getting better as my win rate has increased a lot. I feel I may be a victim of bad plays. 

I die very often early game, in a rush for weapons. I'm straight up terrible at pushing people inside buildings. 
Aside from those early game issues, my most common cause of death seems to be getting sniped in long range fights, or dying trying to defend a downed teammate. 

Some problems with my gameplay I've noticed. 

- I am laid back and will rarely push for a build fight 
- I don't use my full arsenal of building and editing tricks
- I get sniped way too much during gunfights 
- I have a habit of full sending after landing a couple AR shots 
- I sometimes think I am console Tfue and go for fluke shots 
- I panick if someone out builds me 


Pros

- My aim is fairly consistent all around. It can be choppy during panick moments and first games. 
- I have perfected a lot of ramp rush techniques minus double floorwallramp. 
- Can edit fairly quickly. 
- Recognising good positioning. 


If any of you guys have any tips and tricks or reference to someone with good tips, I'd love the help. 
I think there is a 3-4KD player in me somewhere, and I know you guys are familiar with these problems and mat know some solutions. 

Thanks, guys!

How? Because of the skillgap. Since there is currently no ranked mode, the newer players have to play normal pubs but that just puts them against a variety of players, including players WAAAY above their skill level. They will NEVER learn to play if they get stomped in seconds. If a ranked mode would be added, they would be able to fight people on their level, and learn to play properly. This would be gamechanging. I am by no means a good player, heck, by today's standards I am a bot with about 40 wins. I would finally be able to fight players who have simillar capabilities to mine. I can take care of myself in normal pubs its not a big deal most of the time, I can pop off 10-14 kills a match, but it would definetly be better to play in matches on my level. Take CSGO for example. Put up a Global Elite player against a... lets say Gold Nova player. Yes, the Nova player would be able to kill the Global player in CERTAIN situations, but the Global player would still stomp the Nova just because they have more gamesense, better gunplay, and better positioning. Now put up a 1.20 KD player against a 5.69 KD player. No difference between the scenarios. Now about what I was saying at the beggining, if new players can't learn the game in an enviorment on their skill level, they will leave. ",FortniteCompetitive

 So when you go into the gameusersettings, change BOTH ResolutionSizeX, ResolutionSizeY/LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeX, LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeY **AND** DesiredScreenWidth, DesiredScreenLength/LastUserConfirmedDesiredScreenWidth, LastUserConfirmedDesiredScreenLength

 You still need to have the custom resolution in your graphic cards settings (for Nvidia at least, can’t vouch for AMD) but it does not need to be set.  As soon as you open Fortnite, your desktop will change to your stretched res, and as soon as you close the game, it will go back to 1920x1080.

Innocents actually got Zexrow a little “worked up” because Zexrow assumed he used a phasing exploit to get into Zexrow’s 1x1, thus resulting in Innocents eliminating Zexrow. Apparently it happened previously before I started watching the stream. Nonetheless, I flip over to innocents stream to see he’s using an Xbox controller on pc and is extremely clean with it. Maybe it was a good day but he was hitting shots like nothing. His aim is really phenomenal. Apart from his aim it’s his play style. He sets himself up for great shots. He’ll fool his opponent to either follow him one way thinking they have the jump on him just to have them catch a full shell to the dome. He also streams and is pretty entertaining.

I myself was always a console player and still is, and by so played with aim assist on by default on most of the games i ever played. Although there's one game series that i always used to turn off aim assist back on PS360 era, it was the CoD series. I started playing this series with aim assist on (don't think you could disable it on cod4), and by the time i was getting better i noticed that sometimes aim assist could really screw me in some situations. 

So i recently tried to play with aim assist off on Fortnite.

I noticed that without aim assist and with a low sens, it was fairly more easy and ""clean"" to track ennemies because you don't have this ""scratch"" to player"" feeling, wich in my case seem to sometimes screw with my aim especially in flick situations since the sens lower conciderably once your crosshair is on the player. I also feel like the tracking is mutch smoother.

Lot of you probably saw the video of Aydan playing without aim assist and literally missing most of his shot. Although i guess it was just for the fun, the mistake a lot of peoples make when trying to play without aim assist is not tweaking the sensitivity.  If you want to give a try to Fortnite without aim assist, you have to lower your sens conciderably. I myself got from 0.75 X 0.65 y to 0.50 X and 0.41 y, aim x0.37.

I truely think there's somes benefits to playing without aim assist especially once we get used to it. Because yes the first time it can feel a bit weird but honestly with a low sens it doesn't even feel that mutch different beside for the ads spamming and you may even notice your tracking being more efficient. 

Of course , there's also downside and here is the biggest one i noticed during my fews games of Fortnite without aim assist : 

With the sens i used, it was fairly easy to track player ads down, with an AR or SMG etc. But when it comes to shotguns , when you want to ads and flick it was pretty bad. The sens was just too low and it was pretty hard to quickly turn while ads'ing but without ads'ing flick was fire and it seemed pretty good to headshot peoples with shotguns. 

What do you guys think about this ? Could this just be some kind of placebo effect or turning off aim assist could really have some benefits especially if we get used/adapt to it ?

Without further ado, here is the guide on how to IGL, and in specific, **how to understand and make calls in relation to speed/tone and importance.**

# Red Calls

**""Right Now""** - This is a prime example of a red call. A red call is a call with low opportunity window and a call with a high importance. A perfect example is **""Finish Him Right Now""** 

In a popup this could be a play to get a point or to recover a quick amount of HP to get the second guy. 
The call being red, indicates the following:

- This call is not contestable.
- This call is must happen.
- This call cannot be explained in the moment
- This call's accuracy must be purely based on trust.


# Yellow Calls
- ""I need X""
- ""Healing""
- ""Reloading""
- ""I'm with you""

These are examples of yellow calls, these calls are important however they do not have direct harm, nor do they require discussion. Putting them into the yellow category. These calls are so that both players are on the same page for economy, and positioning. It's quite important that yellow calls take up a good chunk of the communications structure. Yellow calls should be **.95:1 of green calls, as yellow calls are typically acknowledgement.**

# Green Calls
- ""Should we...""
- ""Lets...""
- ""What do you think about...""
- ""We can...""

These are all examples of green calls. Green calls are low importance, these calls should be habitual for most duos. These calls are important for the planning phase, but often they become overlooked. It is exceptionally important for the IGL to consider other opinions post game so that they can learn from their teammates or have their teammates learn from them. These calls should not happen in fights. Green calls are typically used for identification purposes.
Fights with **high TTK** (*Time to Kill*) have some room for green calls - as these lengthy fights are quite annoying and planning might be fully needed.

Discussion as a team is important unless you have a **solo micro-macro caller.** *This is exceptionally difficult and the typical stereotype for callers who both micro-macro are that they lack mechanical skill and use communications to make up for it.* A co-caller environment is the best to take advantage of importance scaling. 


# Importance Scaling/Colouring also allows you to talk over your teammates. 

For example, the call: *""Can you drop me mats.""* Can be completely over written by: **""Spray 210 Right now - Tagged back guy 35 blue 35, blue, 70, Knocked""**
 
Thats a yellow call, being completely overwritten by a red call. Adding ""now"" or ""Right now"" instantly elevates the importance of a call. It raises the same importance as: *""He's oneshot""*

**Be very careful that your calling ecosystem does not dilute these keywords so that the importance factor stays.** 

Team fights should only consist of Red / Yellow calling in my opinion. Please keep in mind that this guide is an **ADDITION** to the guide that was previously written. These colours can be applied to all of the tips that were previously mentioned.


# How does this help you?

By identifying the communications of you and your duo, you can see the types of calls and the importance of the calls that he is making. You can see if most of his calls are green and there's not enough yellow where you need to have yellow. You can see if he overuses red calling. You can see if there is room available to have him call more green or red. The colour system is a way for players to identify if the current calling environment is utilizing importance scaling. Typically some duos will say ""dude don't say stuff like that; it doesn't matter when we are in a fight"" but rarely does it happen every game. Understanding the importance factor of each call allows the duo to make accurate calls given the importance factor of the fight.  This importance factor analysis can aid in the formation of proper planning and proper in-fight calls. It also helps split the calling load in a co-caller environment. 

As always, I am open to answering any questions in the comments below.

1. Eliminates shield RNG early game
2. Can’t be pickaxed/bludgeoned as fast
3. Allows every player to have at least a chance with the weapon they have, a shotgun is superior of course but if a player is shot they can have a chance to react and build/fight back. 

This isn’t necessary but IMO it decreases the chance of having an unlucky drop and might make the game more fun.

Practice is typically the equivalent of scrims, which is fine, but I feel like many players are just playing to play and are just playing to win games.


**You do not necessarily need to win your practice games to be successful.** If you suck at a specific route, a specific play, a specific edit even. Target that aspect of your game and practice. 

There are plenty of things that go into being a successful fortnite player, let's start by listing them.

- Connections - We'll save this controversial topic for a later point in time (However it is in my firm belief that connections do not matter anymore in the current pro community.)
- Mechanics - The ability to mechanically execute tasks.
- Gamesense - The knowledge of which mechanical tasks to execute. 
- Communications - The ability to relay information to your teammates and the ability to respond in an appropriate matter.


These things are mainly what make up a fortnite player. Now how do I even know what to practice? *(You could drop a sub to my twitch and submit a vod for me to review on stream. I mean shit have y'all heard of this thing called twitch prime? LOL)*

All plugs aside; review your own gameplay with the mentality that there is something wrong. There's always something wrong. I've only seen 1 perfect game before in fortnite and a majority of what I do is watch games. There's always at least 1 thing wrong so try to find the most obvious one and fix it.

**Ask yourself why it's wrong**. Don't just say ""Ah I choked""


# What went wrong?
- This guy didn't die.
- He didn't die because My shots didn't connect.
- My shots didn't connect because my arm got stiff when holding the angle
- I need to work on my aim so that my arm doesn't get stiff.
- What can help me when my arm gets stiff? - Kovaaks' Ascended Tracking V2 Time Scale 1+

By asking why, **you jump from ""Ah I choked shots"" to a more complex answer.**

This can be done with every aspect of the game. This works exceptionally well with communications and mechanics.
Once you identify your error you can truly practice fortnite.

I am open to answering any and all questions, however I am on ""vacation"" right now with 10kbps so please bear with me LOL.

Practice **with purpose** makes perfect.

Firstly, the email that was sent out to us was very vague. The email sent out to us for the **qualifier** information included [this.](https://i.imgur.com/HKsr8oJ.jpg) It states 6 rounds, which made all of us believe the qualifiers were having 6 matches. However, this isn’t correct. It’s only **one** match, for the entire wave. Some people flew out here, rented out an airbnb, just to die off a bad spawn drop. It’s stupid. 


Second, for my wave, 4, was suppose to start at 2:30 PM. As I’m writing this, it’s 4 PM and wave 3 hasn’t even started yet. Not only was it suppose to start at 2:30,[ the email told us](https://i.imgur.com/WpJLs9d.jpg) to come **two hours earlier.** Everybody in my wave, including psalm who has been sitting next to me, have been waiting here for 4 whole hours. We haven’t been waiting inside either, we’ve been waiting on the first floor of a parking garage with foldable chairs and portable gas heaters. It’s pretty shit. 

Anyways, yeah, that’s all I really wanted to say. Hopefully epic (even though they didn’t host this one, they’ve had some problems in the past with tournaments) and other companies will see the community feedback and realize the issues.

It devalues some of what makes the heavy sniper so incredibly powerful with the ability to instakill wood and take out brick and metal in its earlier stages when it's lost vulnerable and also most likely to be taking fire. On top of all that it has a huge clip size so whether or not your shots are bricking someone for 100+ or destroying a building you can almost  always find value out of your shots. I think the deagle flies under the radar while we see a bunch of posts on here every day about planes and turrets being OP one key reason: All the good players love the deagle.  At first I was the same way. We always wanted it to be strong enough to warrant a spot, but now it's a must keep competitive item. In a lobby of good players there's no other item besides the grappler (which is incredibly OP for late game rotations) as important as the deagle. The amount of ways you can use it to fuck over another player is nuts. If you think a regular rocket coming at you is annoying, the ones with a deagle coming in a millisecond before the rocket are even worse and have almost no counterplay.Its easy to say ""just build brick or metal"" but both of those surfaces are vulnerable in the beginning seconds to deagle spam and it late game scrims/league/popup cup there's more people alive in the end circles and there's always someone who's either out of brick/metal or conserving it for later rotations Boyer was cheesed by the deagle/rocket combo in WInter Royale and it was one of those deaths that just felt really shitty to watch, like Natehill dying to a fall damage bug in the summer skirmish and they both felt like cheap deaths for different reasons. I think it's important they don't completely remove the deagle from the Meta but at the very least they should consider a few tweaks to it like giving it a smaller clip or maybe even possibly making brick feel more meaningful when fighting against the deag? Or hell just lower its player damage but keep the insane structure damage it does. There's some things they could do while keeping the deagle a fun to use weapon without overnerfing it and making it lose its uniqueness. Thoughts? ",FortniteCompetitive

I am a Dk fan 

So naturally my loadout every game is 

Ak Pump Deagle Mini Sniper

But recently i've been dying to splodes a lot

No matter how fast i turtle atleast one rocket slips right in or not making an accusation or anything on Epic but sometimes i've gotten damage even when the splode hit my just building wall...again i don't have the clip to prove this so take it with a huge grain of salt like very huge.

Anyhow guys i feel that explosives are more op than sniper seeing how well they do in game

I tried using some myself only to kill myself...lol

So my questions for you guys are

1. What is the Best Explosive in game?
2. How to use rockets without dying?
3. How to kill people with them or atleast do some damage?
4. What is the 100% method to counter splode spam?

Tldr: Dk fan here planning on dropping the snipe for splodes just like i dropped smg for deagle and need help on how and which explosive weapon to use.

Thank you guys for taking the time to read this

The results are underwhelming because they have massively different. Poach is the one of the best if not the best at lowground. Vivid likes highground. They also seem to almost never be together in scrims. They always play for themselves, as if they are in solos. This is on purpose, they know their playstyles don't mesh.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a7qun5/im\_such\_a\_tryhard\_and\_im\_so\_bad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a7qun5/im_such_a_tryhard_and_im_so_bad/)

&amp;#x200B;

With some time gone, I had some time to think about why that is. I know a lot of people in this sub are really good and they don't need this, but maybe some are as bad as me but have a strong urge to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing is aim. So if you haven't played shooters the aim is pretty bad which is a big disadvantage. The level of aim of very good players to reach is way harder than to reach a pro level of building, if you haven't played shooters for years. (Even though good aim helps you with building also).

&amp;#x200B;

Second very important thing is if you are bad it's actually super hard to improve. You die fast and you spend a lot of time queuing up and flying, which of course neither improves your building not your aim. If you land in Tilted, Retail, Salty or Pleasant, especially if its on the bus road you will have a lot of RNG involved + 3rd parties, where even pro players die often. This additionally decreases your effective play time. So most pros might not see it, but Noobs play one hour and have like 2 real fights which actually improves their game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third the game is not in the early phase anymore, so a lot of tricks are already pretty advanced. It's not just building up or   build a wall after a shotgun shot anymore. So with just playing you might not get what's really going on. If you would have played from the beginning you would probably learnt that faster.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is my personal plan to fight this?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm spending way more time with editing courses (Mongraal + Candook) + Kovaaks Aim Trainer (Covaaks Long Strafe + Tile Frenzy).  I think if you really wanna maximize your improvement that should be 50% of your time + 10% watching educational videos (I personally think for PUBS sypherpk is really good) + 10% analyzing your games. And yes only 30% actually playing. Even those 30% should be optimized. So no landing in super crowded places, but also not hiding. I think a middle of both is good. If you see someone building up like crazy it is also fine to just dodge. When I see pros I see they are very very patients and we noobs rush way too often anyway. Take the fights you can win and improve your chances. The more effective play time you have the faster you gonna improve. I think from a difficulty level its. Big Teams LTM, LTM, Squads, Solo, Duos, Popup/Scrims. See where you are able to get a couple of kills in and improve. BTW do 30% warmup before playing + 20% after you have played maybe working on what didn't work good.

&amp;#x200B;

This plan is for me also, since my goal now is to move up to a 1 KD in solo. I thought it may help others also. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lil Beginner tips that helped me to improve a bit just by knowing:

\- Right Peek Advantage

\- Always remember to shoot and cover

\- Use a mousepad and low sensitivity

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you pros have also some more tips for us noobs. I will edit this then.

I personally would like to see them removed, but considering they were the main “big add” from Epic for s7, I doubt they would consider removing them. I digress.....

1) Only allow glider redeploy from a plane that has been destroyed.

This would create significantly more risk in using planes without nerfing them to an unusable state. Players would either need to accept 50 HP damage or find a place to safely land their plane, which exposes the player to potential damage during landing (especially in scrim/cup endgames).

This change would also mitigate some of the frustrating third partying (dive bombing a structure then hopping out of the plane to glide into a perfect spot to finish kills). Without the ability to redeploy in this scenario, plane users would have to land before being able to engage.

This also indirectly would buff balloons, which could be used to bail from a high altitude plane to negate fall damage.

2) Increase damage dealt to planes caused by ramming structures. The recent increase Epic made was a step in the right direction, but I think we can all agree it wasn’t enough.

Maybe make planes invulnerable to structure damage within ~5 seconds of initial takeoff to deal with structures that may be blocking them.

My main binds are:

Pinkie: L Shift - Cone

Ring: Q - Wall, 1-3 Pickaxe toggle and weapon slot 1/2

Middle: W - Forward

Index: E - Stairs, T - Reload, F Edit, 4-6 - weapon slot 3/4/5

Thumb: Space - Jump, C - Floor, V - Use

I’m considering moving Use to Tab and Reload to Caps 

I seem to be able to edit a ramp then floor repetitively at a decent speed with minimal mistakes (36 seconds at 25 blocks high, 500 mats) faster than I could with a controller which is a sign that I can definitely increase my skill with the switch and is motivating me

**My hand aches after only 1 hour of constant use, is that just because I’m not used to the binds or that they are not well spread apart?**

**Are my binds well spread out across each of my fingers?** 
 
I have seen a few pros binds and noticed that those that don’t use mouth build binds use Q C E V etc

**Is being able to press space and C V (the bottom row) simultaneously very important since I use thumb for both?

Half of these questions may sound stupid but I haven’t tried learning something this complicated for a while 

If anyone has recently switched or remembers what issues they had and had resolved them please feel free to drop that if you can

I'm on controller so its very hard to hit their head hitbox. He had 100 lifetime wins and a 2 percent win ratio.

He did not put in the countless hours perfecting mechanics to be above the rest like I and many others did. He shouldn't be able to cheese himself to a win. It shits on players who took the time to get good at this game. The casual audience is not what will keep your game going it's the hardcore people like me and many others.

**Play competitively**
Don't expect to go anywhere with 5 daily hours of pubs. Play scrims. Play pop-ups. Join tournaments. Of course, playing pubs is still an essential, but you should be spending more time playing competitive than pubstomping.

**Practice efficiently**
It is one thing to practice on Playgrounds/Creative for hours, and it is another thing to practice *efficiently* on Playgrounds/Creative. This means using the latest drills, practicing the techniques you'll actually use in-game, and furnishing your weaknesses. Your aim should also be trained, and if you really want to enhance that part of your game, use trainers such as Kovaaks, Aimtastic, and such.

**Upgrade your specs**
Obviously better parts doesn't always equal better gameplay, but it certainly does enhance your gameplay, even if it is just a little bit. Do not expect to play at a high level with a crappy OG Xbox Onez, running barely at 60fps, and maxed effects, textures, shadows. Buy a PC that can at least run around 100fps, and get good gear (mouse, mousepad, etc)

**Stay determined**
Things aren't always going to go your way. Sometimes it can be as little as a plane messing up your scrim game, or maybe it can be practicing for weeks and not noticing any changes. Always stay focused and determined. If you are not getting better, make sure to think about why you aren't, and find a way. Keep grinding, and you'll get results.

I am in no way a pro Fortnite player, but I have noticed major differences in my skill since I started taking the game more seriously. After upgrading to a PC, grinding daily scrims, and playing almost 8hrs a day, I can definitely say that *I am finally having way more fun that I used to when I was trash*. The game is so much easier, and it is really amazing to be going up against real pros, facing them in popups and such.",FortniteCompetitive

In the recent months, I have started noticing a new trend with building that was called the 90s I knew what it was about but seemed kind of pointless to me. When doing a 90-degree turn instead of a 180 turn you still use pretty much the same amount of materials and have a fairly similar speed of climbing (i understand that is faster but not as fast as people might think). I never see streamers use the tactic in actual fights, or any pro players in scrims. Why do people show off their 90 degree turns in their videos when they try to show off? Why is it such a big deal? And most importantly: Is it even worth learning? I used about 2 hours today for learning it myself and it's not really hard at all just requires me to get some muscle memory on what and at what moment I should press to get them till perfection.

Would these switchs create for better performance? I am well aware getting a PC is the wave but it does not fit my budget what so ever at the moment and making these changes is a possibility until I can go big.

We Need The Popup Cup Rules 24/7,"I don't normally play big team modes (e.g. Disco Domination, Team Rumble).

Today I played a couple of the big team modes for a few hours to check them out and do challenges, and they were full of bots. I was wondering why the quality of solos had risen recently. The new and casual players ar playing the team modes where their poor play is not so exposed. And I can't blame them, the team modes are fun, and good practice. If you're new at the game, you're going to get plenty of chances to practice fighting without constantly getting kicked back into the lobby.

So who's playing the normal modes? OK, you'll still run into absolute bots from time to time, but since Epic introduced the big team modes, the normal modes already became much more competitive. Public games have endings a lot like the kind of ending you would have seen in a scrim 3 or 4 months ago. 

Yes, the faster harvesting and 50 health/shield per kill increase the skill gap, but the people who are playing solos/duos/squads can handle it. New players and casual players who don't stand a chance of winning can stick to the team games.

Because there is absolutely  no point for playing competitively when there is no opportunities are given to compete in any event or qualifiers 

So why would a player choose to go competitive and spend hours  playing scrims for nothing 

Even if Epic starts to give Asia and Oce  some events to play in we would be far behind due to lack of experience and practice,besides all of this there is no servers for the Middle East and North Africa you have to play on high ping ,the same with SEA you may face high ping when connected to the main server.

I recently stopped hot dropping because I was getting tilted and lose full. If you don’t land on or get a shotgun and some shield you’re fucked. I usually play 2-5 am NAE and we get half the lobby landing tilted literally 10 people on big bertha. I stopped that RNG bullshit started landing away from the first few POIs the bus goes over. Early game kills are easy usually bots because sweats land on the first POI or tilted; and RNG more forgiving because there are less people around. Mid game I can win my 1v1s I have good health, good mats and load out. Occasionally I get clapped but almost always I survive till top 10 with kills anywhere from 4-7.. end game I choke 4 wins with 109 top 10 placements. How do I fix this? landing away from hot drops boosts my confidence to W key all. Will I improve playing this way or get back to hot dropping? 


I rarely survive hot drops. Only way I can survive is to camp and I hate that. Tilted for example, once I clear and loot big bertha I go to new building get some wood and go fight closest area I hear shots from; 3 seconds later 100 other people are with us or tagging me from apartments or tacos.. they wont come out just tag me from distance, or snipe me while I try to replace a wall against the player I’m fighting who’s turtled. Is that how I should be playing it? Clear my building and be in it tagging people till circle forces me to move or until everyone leaves tilted or dies? 


What should I work on to win end game?

Also would love to hear some advice if I do switch over to KBM. ,FortniteCompetitive

It's a good res for ar shots and far fights.  
1080x1080 ,1154x1080: honestly I like it too its good for only shotgun combat.The issue with them is that you can't really tell if there is someone looking at u from far distance or not (died so many to snipers who I didn't notice that they are even looking  at me OMEGALUL).  
1440x1080,1444x1080: The difference between them is the dot in the cursor and they are ALPHA since they are in the middle between 1600x1080 and 1080x1080 so its more balanced.  


PROS and CONS  
1600x1080:  
•Good Vision.  
•Good far distance ar fights.  
•Kinda bad tbh for low ground warriors.  


1080x1080,1154x1080:  
•Great for the low ground warriors.  
•Makes you more into the game and makes u feel that you're more competitive. ( i might be wrong)  
•VERY poor far distance fights.  
•Poor vision and blurry.

So, I just had a quick question to hopefully get answered. To preface the question, the mouse I currently use is a Zowie FK1. It is a wonderful mouse, but for me, it does not work so well because it is hard plastic and my hands are always unable to grip it because they are too slick.   


Would anyone be able to recommend me a mouse that has a ""grippier"" shell that is still a ""top of the line"" mouse, as aim is very important to me, as I play CS:GO as well.

Pop up cups are just so refreshing and fun, once you start playing them you don’t wanna go back to pubs. And that is bad considering the fact that you can’t play cups all day long, and you have to wait for the tourney to begin. The best way to win pubs is to land uncontested, farm up and play passive.

# The Logistics of Strafing

## Why do we strafe? 
We strafe so that we can take fewer hits. A target that is continuously moving, is more difficult to hit than a target that doesn’t move at all.

## How do most people strafe?
Most people strafe with a combination of a left or right movement. Commonly referred to as **ADAD SPAM**. This is effective when timed correctly. How can you do this with max efficiency?

## How Should I strafe?
The first step on doing this with max efficiency is understanding timings. If you’re strafing shotgun v shotgun, you want to strafe at around 80% of the time it takes for the re-prime of the weapon. Be careful to think about error margin. 

In a Blue Pump V Blue Pump situation, you want to strafe for .06 in the A direction, so that on the .065th timestamp, you’re switching direction. I wouldn’t swap strafe earlier than the .06 margin. This does not mean you go in one direction for timestamps .01-.06; this just means that once you hit the .06, you will absolutely need to swap to decrease the likelihood of the enemy hitting that shot.

**“Convertible, won’t I miss my shots?”** - No you won’t miss your shots because you know where you are going, he will miss his because he doesn’t know where you are going.

However, if you both don’t know where you’re going, then it’s back to equilibrium and the result is based on luck. 

The key point here is to identify the weapon that the enemy has, and strafe accordingly to that weapon. If it’s a sniper, we know to peek right after his sniper shot and to duck right before, because players consciously do it vs snipers. Players don’t consciously do it vs weapons like Deagle or AK’s though and players should. 

## What is effective movement?
Effective movement is not walking in a straight line, effective movement is utilizing cover, taking advantage of builds and using those for angles, and not walking in straight lines. If you’re in a hallway, and there’s an enemy at the end of the hallway, if you walk at him in a straight line he’s going to have a much easier time shooting you than he would if you bounced between the walls left and right. The same concept goes for open fields and approaching build battles and third parties. If you run straight at someone, no cover, it’s quite easy for them to **First Shot Accuracy** (FSA) and hit those shots.

## Reloads / Weapon Swaps
Reloads isn’t as important when you have multiple weapons, but make sure when you take the fight you have enough ammo. Fights can be divided into two phases, the hunt and the kill.

**The hunt** often refers to everything that you do that does not damage the enemy, zoning, breaking builds, trying to get an edit, build battling. Often times general/fight economy is tipped during this phase of the fight, materials, ammo, or zone advantage.

**The kill** refers to the time that you spend actually damaging the enemy. 

If you spend 29/30 shots in the hunt, and your weapon hasn’t been reloaded, when you go for the kill you probably won’t have much damage at hand.

**Weapon swapping** is also crucial for effective hunting. Don’t AR spam wood walls if you have a Deagle that can deal with it, choosing the right weapon for the right situations will help you keep your enemy player damage potential high.

This has been a thing since the Winter Royale where many w keyers qualified and glorified the playstyle. The problem is that even those same players are not dumb enough to play that way when actual money is on the line, hence how they all played during the Winter Royale heats. 

The community needs to make a gentleman's agreement to play end game and play like money is on the line. Stop the tilted hotdrops, stop the w keying, and play for the win. The pop-up cups could be amazing practice for us, but we ruin it ourselves.",FortniteCompetitive

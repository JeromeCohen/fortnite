And pressing F to enter, right click to reset and MB5 to confirm edit could be as fast as scroll wheel but I find myself messing it up pretty often.

&amp;#x200B;

So I figured out since you are using another button to confirm edit (for me its F to enter edit and MB5 to confirm), you can bind reset edit to your original edit keybind. So in my case I just double click F to reset. It's not as fast as scroll wheel but still fast enough I think.

Another option is to press it backwards MB5 to enter and F to reset and confirm which is really fast. Only negative is that it's obviously still easier to mess up then scrolling a wheel twice :)",FortniteCompetitive

It works, is 100% legal and non-bannable, even suitable for streamers! (Don't blame me when you find out you won't gain any vertical FOV, blame Epic instead...)

It works by forcing Fortnite to a 16:9 aspect ratio on a custom resolution like 1440x1080 or 1280x1080. I made a small program which does that automatically.

&amp;#x200B;

Steps to the epic stretched victory royales:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Set your custom resolution (I assume you already know how to do that)

2) Launch Fortnite and run my program (you need to do this every time you launch)

Personally, what angers me the most is that we're left hanging in this weird limbo. Anyone who ever played a game that has a competitive side to it knows, that establishing a strong competitive community is the foundation for the longevity of the game, yet there's no indication that shows any form of interest on Epic's side, outside of throwing a few million dollar at it, which very well might be nothing more than a big advertisement for their game. With the current state of the game and the lack of communication regarding that matter, people who actually care will eventually move on. It's honestly frustrating that they - and here I'm addressing Epic, not the devs themselves - not only not address community concerns, they don't even have the decency to tell us wether or not they plan to discuss certain issues (FOV, anyone?) with us or not.

**Bug Fixes &amp; Improvements**

* The Hold to Swap functionality is now confirmed upon releasing the Use button rather than when initially pressing it.
* This should help with the issue of accidentally swapping.

&amp;#x200B;

I just played a few games and picking up weapons and items currently feels awful. It's so silly to have weapons only pick up at the end of the key-press and it makes the game feel so much more clunky and unresponsive. The worst thing is that I didn't even notice the so called 'accidental swapping' when Hold to Swap was initially implemented.

It should've been fixed by adding a toggle for 'Enable Hold to Swap' in the game settings, something which HAS already been suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bagm3k/hold_to_swap_is_very_poorly_implemented_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). This change has made the situation worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't understand why Hold to Swap was even added because it's only ever applicable during early game when you don't have an item in every slot. If you're having that much of a hard time using it just turn it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Another poorly executed design choice because Epic insists that they have to release content every week without allocating any real time to bug fixes. \*Sigh\*",FortniteCompetitive

You can que up solo with a friend in discord and ghost team the entire game. Teaming isnt always standing next to each other double teaming. It can be two people opposite zone in discord agreeing to not shoot each other and to focus the same boxes. This ghost teaming is WAY worse than actual teaming because its virtually impossible to detect. You can even fake fight with building. Just spam eachothers turbo builds and disengage like you see every game.

Even on LAN with random skins, you can have two players/teams agree to split the same landing spot 50/50 and agree to never rotate into each others halfs. If you land there, you have to fight both teams everytime. I believe theres rampant ghost teaming everywhere. With discord being an obvious way to get exposed, two teams/players can use a phone and NEVER get exposed down the line.


You're simply naive if you believe there isnt ghost teaming in online tournaments and even on lan. If someone asks you to ghost team off public record like a discord message why wouldnt you? You have nothing to lose at that point and no proof of agreeing. If you ever got exposed their would be no record. If someone asks you before lan to split a drop. Why wouldnt you?

The best mappings for editing, are 100%, on the triggers and bumpers. I can't think of a reason to have your edits on any other buttons. Moving your thumb like that for hours on end is not good, and will cause big time strain issues later on. 

Mapping your edits on the bumpers and triggers do not conflict with any other binds. The only downside is you may occasionally place random builds if your not accurate enough switching into edit and confirming the edits. If you're not using the top buttons for editing already, your edit speed should increase by a substantial amount.

Even season 4... \*gasp\* I know!

&amp;#x200B;

We have siphon mode... Which is arguably one of the best things to happen to competitive Fortnite. We have ranked! Okay, it's not *great*, but it's *something*. We have lots of mobility options! We have a decent range of weapons! You know what we don't have?  


Zombies.

Airplanes.

Drum gun.

Ice traps.

C4.

Quad rocket launcher.

&amp;#x200B;

We can jump around near ziplines without automatically locking on to them and getting whisked off somewhere we didn't plan to be. We have moving storm end game so people aren't just sitting in a box with 5 medkits waiting to have a heal off and avoid fighting everyone. We have so many ways to navigate the map quickly. We have mats on elim! Faster farming!

&amp;#x200B;

And best of all... no *shing shing shing*.

&amp;#x200B;

I just felt the need to point this out because all I read lately are complaints. Give us FOV slider! Ranked sucks! Audio is bad! Yeah I get it, the game has problems. But can we just take a moment to be even a tiny bit happy that the state of the meta is actually pretty enjoyable for once?  


Oh yeah, and I know I mentioned season 4. Look, I loved it as much as anyone... but double pump was an abused mechanic and the overall meta was more suited for pub stomping and not a competitive game.",FortniteCompetitive

Title. In NAE there is a subregion in Ohio and in Virginia. In west it is california and oregon. Why are players being split but still put on the same prize pools, and given the same number of qualification spots? 

Imagine you were #2 on leaderboards in NAW duos. Only one team gets that World Cup invite. However, the team in first lives in Seattle, and are thus put on Oregon servers, and you are put on California servers. However, if less players play on Oregon, then the team in first will get worse lobbies, because Epic’s matchmaking will pull lower point players to fill in the lobbies. You on the other hand are in much harder lobbies because significantly more players are playing on the Cali servers, therefore increasing the density of high point players. 

This ought to be addressed by Epic.",FortniteCompetitive

Here's the problem, once you reach champs there's nothing else to grind for and that means that 75% of the people in champs are brainless w-keyers. No one seems to give a shit that there are million dollar tournaments happening every week and this is our best chance to practice for them. I have a separate account to play with friends and the games at 280-290 points were INFINITELY better practice then the games at 330-350. I switched accounts at around 290 because I wanted skins and I told him to get ready for the W-key, we proceeded to get pushed midgame THREE DIFFERENT TIMES in one game. We killed all of them and he is in champs now, but it was night and day from the games in high level contenders.   

  
This is especially a problem in duos and really makes champs a terrible time investment if you want to practice. If you can't find customs or scrims with people who actually give a shit about endgame it's the biggest waste of time because you WILL run into someone who does not care about ruining their game as well. They will storm push you, waste launches or rifts to chase you down and jump right into your box. This is unavoidable at this point because it's absolutely EVERYWHERE in champs. 50 people left alive mid game? You best believe half of those are going to do everything they can to make sure they don't survive till mid game. Seriously, go play team rumble or Creative if all you want to do is kill people, I'm getting really sick of little Timmy.

If they'd be removed at the end of the season all casual players who have fun with them in pubs would be pissed, so I don't see epic doing that.

I know a lot of you here hate this change with an absolute passion, and I can understand why. However, I believe the removal of siphon has been good for the overall game. Now that siphon is just in arena most of the competitive players are just playing arena. This has meant that the people playing normal solos, duos and squads are no where near as good as they were before. While siphon was in the game pubs were very very hard, so much so that no causal players would want to play it. Now all the good players have moved to arena because of siphon, pubs have become a playlist where the casual players can actually enjoy the game. The point of pubs is to be the casual game mode and that is exactly what it is at the moment. Honestly I thought I would hate playing without siphon again, and it did take a bit of getting used to. However once I'd played a few games I realised I was really enjoying it because I didn't have to go super try hard every game. I could enjoy the game in a more relaxed fashion. This was the whole purpose of removing siphon and it has 100% succeeded 

TL;DR - removal of siphon had the intended effect of making pubs more casual, and that has been a good thing for the game.",FortniteCompetitive

Hey Folks,

I collected some data on where teams were dropping during this weekend's World Cup Qualifier Final and I wanted to share. I looked at 15 random games from the replay files and tracked how many teams were landing at what I percieved to be the 31 most populated locations on the map. The complete data set can be found in the google docs link above. I titled each game by a game number and under it the direction of the bus path.

I conducted a small, informal analyses of the data where I looked at the average number of teams that dropped at each location per game, the highest number of teams that dropped at each location in one game, and the number of times no one dropped at each location.

The results showed that Frosty Flights, Tilted Towers, and Happy Hamlet were the hottest drops, all averaging more than 2 teams per game. Surprisingly, no teams landed at in Lazy Lagoon 8 out of the 15 games. Other locations that were often empty were Shifty Shafts and Salty Poverty, both empty 10 out of the 15 games, and Mini Junk, empty 11 out of the 15 games. Frosty Flights was the only location that had at least one team in all 15 games. All 30 other locations were empty at least once. Frosty Flights and Happy Hamlet were tied for the most teams in one game at 6 teams. The full results of the analysis can be found on Page 2 of the spreadsheet

I disregarded any game where there were 7 or more teams in Tilted as this was likely due to the limited time of the tournament and would skew the results. There were several spots on the map that were highly populated that I was not tracking, including the area between Happy Hamlet and Frosty Flights, the area between Sunny Steps and Lonely Lodge, and the Lava Flow area. If there was only one member of a team at a location I was tracking I counted that as being a full team. 

Hopefully this can be helpful to anybody looking for a new drop spot, new rotation, or to get a better understanding of where the average competitive lobby is dropping. I have a background in Psychological Statistics and in Sports Analytics and I have wanted to get involved in eSports analytics for quite some time. This was informal and fairly quick and easy to do. I plan on doing more data collection and analyses on competitive Fortnite in the future. If you have any areas of the game that you'd like me to research, I'd love to hear.

I remember one time when one Overwatch streamer thought it would be fun to stream himself starting from the lower ranks and making his way up, but along the way he destroyed the matches for everyone else involved, he obviously got a ton of backlash and had to post an apology.

1. Let people Derank. So if you go 50 pts below (or less) your division point treshold you should drop to the lower division.

2. Make more divisons! People in champions don’t have anything to get or lose so they don’t play for the win. I saw eryctriceps get a 10 man endgame on 500+ pts and I think that is extremely bad for the comp.

Obviously make region based top 500 for the highest points and then a global one where we could see also the region they’re playing from. (To see if America dominates or if Asia dominates the points)

My suggestion would be: 

Bronze, silver, gold -1 pts. 

Platinum, diamond, master -2 pts 

Champion -3 as it is but the with bigger point tresholds. 

For example: Bronze - 100, silver - 200 and so on.

3. If we get more divisions the points should reset every 2 months to for example:

If you’re Silver you should reset to 0 (bronze)

If you’re Gold you should reset to 100 (silver)

And so on except:

If you’re champion you should reset to 700 (champ)

This to make people get the need to grind or they would lose their division. It could also just reset to that divisons lowest points but then you should need to get more pts to move up exc.

4. To get the casuals playing make it so you get new cosmetics in every division. For example:

Bronze: Emote/spray

Silver: Contrail

Gold: Wrap

Platinum: Glider

Diamond: Backbling

Master: Pickaxe

Champion: Skin

And to keep the high point players entertained you could unlock new variations of the skin with the amount of points earned in champion with the skin (or smth)

Don't get me wrong, Floor is lava, and Air royale is insane, the runes are cool and mysterious, and the cosmetics we've gotten have also been great, but the core game is falling apart. Its a battle in a way: The community versus Epic. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Siphon and Mats. The obvious one. Public matches have been almost ruined. Solos are the worst right now. If you are one of those people that say ""If we played the game for 7 Seasons without it, then why are you complaining"", then picture it like this. I have a controller that has buttons removed, it doesn't charge properly, and it requires tape to keep it intact. But then I get a brand new controller. This controller is smoother, it feels less clunky, and its not broken. I love it, but then I am told that I cannot use it, and i'm back to using the broken controller. This game is like a broken controller, and when siphon and mats were added, it became fresher and better. This is not Seasons 0-7, this Fornite is not the same as the original Fortnite, you cannot compare it. While i could live without siphon, I don't want to play Farming Simulator on a Windows XP. Its boring as hell. People were confident. They knew that playing risky would reward the, third parties were not as bad, Solo squads was fun to watch, people were not just hiding.

&amp;#x200B;

* The biggest problem is not siphon or mats anymore. While that is still a huge issue, its not the biggest, which kinds shows how bad the game is right now. Yes, Fortnite is still the top game on twitch and youtube, but that is mainly because of the content creator and the entertaining pros. We watch them because they are funny, good at the game, because they know what is right for the game. They play it the most, they know the most about it. This doesn't mean that the rest of the community are wrong because on every single poll that anyone has made for siphon, its not been a 50/50 spit, its been 90/95% want it back.  These are not useless polls. They represent the community, and Epic has yet to understand that yet.

&amp;#x200B;

* Speaking of polls, Twitter has been just dumb. Every single post that fortnite has made, its been a spam of REVERT, and a mass load of every single problem in Fortnite. Also, what kinda pisses me off, is that streamer complain when a troll skin comes out, saying that Epic are not spending more time on the problems, when the cosmetics team are DIFFERENT to the development team. We get it. The game is in a terrible state, but we don't want spam of the same thing. If you want to make difference, then use the feedback system. That is the best way for Epic to listen to us. Not reddit, or youtube or twitch or whatever. The game has a built in feedback system. Use it.

&amp;#x200B;

* Performance Issues. This is an obvious issue. Ghost shots, guns not firing, lag spikes, textures not loading, the lobby not working, Blank hit-markers. The list goes on. This is a game that has made Epic a MULTI-BILLIONAIRE. Your are into the second week of the WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS, which is rewarding players thousands and thousands and THOUSANDS of Dollars.  If there are multiple people that don't go through because their weapon does not shoot, or their shot does 0 damage, there will be a RIOT.  End games in Arena can be just a battle of the pc or console. Its dumb luck, and whoever can afford the better pc is just the better player. Even then Ninja, who probably has the best PC in the entire world, hit 10 FPS. How does that even happen on one of the beefiest PCs?

&amp;#x200B;

* Arena is bad. No, not bad. TERRIBLE. It is not a good preparation for World Cup or any other big cup. First of all, the division gap is too small. If you are a average player, you could get to Division 6 quite easily, and then not going up at all. You see pros smurfing and getting to Champion in one day. There needs to be a bigger gap between Divisions. It should be maybe 400 or even 500 points to Champion. It would make the division mean more than just a simple level up. It would make each division more rewarding to go to. Now, the gameplay of Arena and just Cups in general is just super bad. I used to play a lot of Overwatch (level 600, diamond rank, 6 gold guns), and when there was a new hero, map or if there was a massive change to a hero, they would be LOCKED for comp for a month, to give comp players time to learn the new stuff, and to give the devs time to make any buffs or nerfs that were needed. I think LoL has a system where Comp plays in older updstes, to give the comp players time to adjust to the new stuff. Overwatch also has a PTR, which would be SO good for this game. If you don't know what PTR is, its basically a demo for the next update, that would be free for PC users, and it would lock Comp, and would have all the new stuff. This game NEEDS this.
* Why does this game need all of this for comp. Weekly items. Boom Bow, and Ballers specifically. Ballers are really good for public. They are fun, but not for Arena. Anyone that says just shoot the ballers are dumb. Attempting to shoot someone can cause your death, and they will just have max materials and max health. There are  still too many spawns. All expedition sites, Frosty Flights, Lazy Links. Too too many. Each one has at least 2 spawns. Dumb Dumb Dumb. Public Matches and Arena matches need to have separate rules and loot pools. Here is my list of what Arena needs to make it better:

1. Vault all of the ""fun"" items. These items include the Boom Bow, Ballers, Heavy Sniper.
2. Increase the spawn rate of Vehicles. It would make rotating better, and all of the other vehicles are not broken and dumb, as you can TAKE DAMAGE WHILE ON THEM..
3. 100% chest spawn rate. This my be a BR game, where RNG is a key part of it, but it can be really unfair if some people get the best items and mats, while others get common loot. It would give everyone a better chance of winning.
4. Ammo should not be floor loot. Why are they floor loot. There is a reason why ammo crates are a thing, and chests give ammo, so ammo on loot is just dumb.

* Feel free to add any other changes, but I think these changes would make Arena more competitive.

&amp;#x200B;

* Speak Epic. I know you are not responding to the help because you know any excuse or reason you put will cause just more upset in the community, but you cannot pretend that everything is fine. Its not. Simple. By hiding more and more, you are making people angrier and angrier. Give us a reason, good or bad, and at least we can have proper discussions on what is good and bad and how we should improve the game AS A COMMUNITY. It would bring you closer to the community. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I think that they have been doing all of these changes to support and help the bad players, to give them a chance. I'm about to say something that might be a bit controversial, but Epic should not focus on newer players anymore, they need to focus on the players that are playing for MONEY, and the ones that actually come back everyday. Focusing on newer players will have a negative impact from now on (unless you add a tutorial mode). Here is what you are risking: You are risking the players that are competing for many and are just playing for money as its their JOB to quit and move on to better games, the community will be pissed off, and you are only making changes to people that might not even play the game for that long. Its is a stupid risk and you need to focus on the current players rather than future ones.

That option is really helpful and reducing the resolution to 1080p does give u way more consistent frame rates and it’s quite helpful. Xbox one X plays at 2160p and I wish u guys could do the same thing for Xbox. Give us an option of 1440p or 1080p there too! Since the Xbox gpu is more powerful then the PS4 pro, we might be able to get even better or stable frame rates at a lower resolution and this will help a lot during endgame and will increase the participation of console players!

Started arena a cpl days ago and sitting around 220 points. I’m not super good but I’m a decent player. Just was looking for some up close shotgun tips.  When I’m in someone’s face or in their box my shotguns are very inconsistent. Do you guys ads up close or just hip fire your shotgun??? I play on a 6-5 sens because any higher and I miss way more. Plus gronky plays 6.5-6 and upshall is at 6-6. So it seems a 6 can be ok. I use a 2.0 build sens to help compensate for a slow combat sens... I’ve tried turtle wars and still don’t feel my up close shotgun is improving much. When up close do you guys flick your right stick a good deal? Or do you use your left stick to aim and use the character movement?? Any tips would be appreciated,FortniteCompetitive

90s for some god damn reason are giving me the BIGGEST issue. Whenever I place my floor, I always end up with a floor being placed above my head at the exact same time. ALWAYS. I can go super slow, I can go super fast. I can look straight down, I can look level, I can look up, no matter what I do there's always a floor and a roof at the same exact time. This primarily the reason I got so good at low ground fighting someone that has height because whenever I try to take height, this shit happens.

Q: Wall

E: Stairs

C: Floor

F: Edit

All while adding useless broken weapons and restrictions that the community hates. 

I believe that They do not care about the community or anyone's feelings about the game. All they care about is what little Timmy wants and little Timmy wants new skins every week...new ways to even the skill gap against competitive players so that they don't quit the game..and no way to refund your money when little Timmy steals mom's credit card. 

And FYI I'm speaking from experience as I have a little Timmy and he doesn't care about any of the issues and has played since season 2 and him and his friends don't care and most likely spend the most money on the game. They are the top shareholders from epics point of view and have the most weight in the decisions they make. 

Competitive is a giant AD for the game as all the big streamers who buy every skin advertise for epic all day everyday for a relatively cheap cost of 1% of their revenue last year. Adding in 5% for creator codes brings total streamer marketing cost to 6% but I imagine the return on investment is more than worth it. Also due to popularity popular streamers make loads of cash so regardless of their feelings and how many tweets they write they continue to play because  the money is too good to pass up and let's be honest what else are they going to play....Apex?

How do I stop panicking in build fights and stay calmer, which will allow me to analyze the situation better? It's worth noting that when practicing edit courses, I also grip my mouse tight for who knows what reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I started playing a few weeks into Season 7, but it was really only the beginning of Season 8 where I decided I wanted to stop getting clapped on in pubs and play better.  I made a post a few weeks ago asking how to improve as someone who can only play on certain days, and the advice definitely helped. I've noticed slow improvements in my games. 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend, however, after playing a few games, I noticed something new. Whenever someone would build a ramp above me when both of us were ramp rushing each other, I felt like I was facing a better builder, or if I was stuck in a 1x1 with someone pressuring me and trying to get out by editing a wall and continuing to build, my mind and building went to shit. I would grip my mouse ridiculously tight (Which is a terrible idea since my Ramp/Wall are on M4/M5), and consistently fuck up building. In build fights where things start to get higher and more prolonged, my mind feels like it's going to shit. If I fall down and lose high ground, my mind essentially doesn't exist anymore and I'll enter full braindead/panic mode. 

&amp;#x200B;

A better player would cone someone who ramped right above them, but not me. Instead, I panic and either A: Try and shoot said ramp down, which either does nothing or causes me to die because the person above me was expecting it, or B, attempt to floor off to the side and continue, but fucking up my building so I look like I'm trying completely new binds because for some reason the little muscle memory I've build goes to shit. That's just one example as well. If someone gains high ground on me, I suddenly forget how to gain high ground.  In replays I'd say nearly all of my deaths come from me making stupid decisions due to panic, or not aiming well due to my grip on the mouse, which is also caused by panic. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that when practicing edit courses, I also grip my mouse tight for who knows what reason. It's gotten better, but I still have to remind myself to relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, my question is in the title. Is this an issue of not enough muscle memory, or not enough ""experience""? Have I simply not played this game enough to know what to do in certain situations?",FortniteCompetitive

In duos there are ways you can outplay/force the person to fight, but in solos, where it is 1v1, there is no chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes there are strats that you can use, tricks to fake them out, and a multitude of other things, but by the time you have tried all of this, you have been third partied, and there are ballers nearby ready to vulture you.   


Changing this would obviously require a huge meta shift, but the fact is it needs to be changed. You can liken it to console performance, and how console players get by on bad FPS and terrible performance and optimization, but there is a viable solution for console players in buying a PC, sure it costs a lot of money, but it is a worthwhile investment that will ultimately improve their career. On the flipside, getting new internet wont solve your ping issue 100%. Let me explain:

&amp;#x200B;

Ninja lives in Chicago, and plays on 25 ping. In order to get this low, he must pay several thousand to have a dedicated fiber line installed, and continue to pay hundreds of dollars a month for the speeds it provides him. If someone has to pay this much to be able to get decent ping, there is an issue. The fact is, it cant be solved through money, other than just moving closer to the servers, which is obviously not viable for the majority of players. So, what are some solutions?

&amp;#x200B;

* The most ideal would be new servers, or rather new sub regions. The only foreseeable issue with this is that you divide the playerbase, and ultimately it would be unfair (especially in tournaments) to split players but keep them within the same prize pool. It is possible to further divide up the prize pool into 4 regions, however since the World Cup qualifiers are well underway, it is most likely too late to change it now, however, Epic has shown disregard for Competitive integrity in the past, so who knows...
* A second option would be forcing a max (or min ping depending on how you look at it). Personally I dont think this is  a good idea, and would not go over well with the community. It would be very much like the stretched res change, but we saw, and are seeing how that plays out. It could work by making all players below say 30 ping, play on 30 ping. This would close the gap between high and low ping players. This is again, not ideal.
* Finally, Epic could just outright change the meta. Add a mechanic that makes boxing up after taking damage a disadvantage, add something that encourages fighting back. Maybe after taking damage you gain back 50% of the damage you do to opponents in the next 30 seconds. This would encourage fighting. Again these are just ideas, but either way, something must be done about the wall replacing/boxing up meta.",FortniteCompetitive

And with most of the tournaments being online qualifiers this advantage has never been more apparent or relevant.
       Switching the initial pull out of the blue print to client side would help remedy this issue. At the moment there are two server side signals that go into placing a  build, one to open the blueprint, and one to confirm the placement. That would mean if a player were on 100 ping, it would take 200ms to place a build if the blueprint wasn't out. 
       The reason I believe this change could work is because pulling out the blueprint doesn't actually change the state of the game, the change takes effect when the build is placed, similar to how editing currently works with client side.
        Building is what makes this game unique, and for people with mid to high ping, the milliseconds matter. Reacting to and blocking shots, catching yourself when falling, and taking/defending builds are just a few examples of where ping simply outclasses skill in Fortnite and where having client side build pull out times would make a huge difference. Would love to see this change happen, let me know if you agree.

- Client side could also potentially be applied to weapon pull out times (though I'd assume this would be more complicated to implement). Weapons use the same two signal system with the server, once to switch to a gun, and once to confirm the shot. So a player with 100 ping would take 200 ms to switch to his shotgun and register the shot.",FortniteCompetitive

It does this as one game I may be in a lobby with multiple people or teams that land at my drop spot so I am contested and therefore there is a high possibility of me dying off spawn as I may get bad loot compared top others etc. If I die off spawn it doesn't completely ruin the possibility of placing higher as I have more many more games. The number of games that can be played in 3+ hours (I say 3+ because of people queuing right at the end to get as many games in as possible) is around 7 for full length 20 + minute matches meaning that everyone have three 'throw-away' games and people can decide to w-key in those games or just play for placement and leave them for if they die off spawn.

I saw a post complaining about how a duo who didn't qualify and they were talking about their average placement, which means nothing as they could have played well a couple of games and got wins (which they did and they got 3) or placed top 3 etc. But this doesn't mean they were consistent. The only improvement I can think of for the format is rewarding 4 an extra point, 3rd an extra point and 2nd an extra point or two.",FortniteCompetitive

SEA Creative and Public Matches always have low ping, and we always practice with low ping but we must slow down in Arena, making it much harder to compete with lower ping players which can take our walls easily.  SEA caters to a lot of countries outside the SEA region such as India (some of it) and the Middle East (temporarily), and Fortnite should attempt to create a way for SEA players to receive low ping in a competitive mode such as Arena.

I think that many people don't play on Arena in the SEA region, is because of Fortnite lacking in-game notification regarding what Arena is. I think renaming it to make it more like World Cup Qualifiers will compel more people to play it. They should allow us to be in smaller lobbies than the minimum 75-80 players, and base placement points based on percentage, such as 32%, 18%, 6% as the placement point thresholds. Such as having a 40 people lobby will require people to place top 12, top 7, top 3 to gain points. This will perhaps allow the small amount of players to form decent queue times for these low ping servers, while retaining the difficulty of getting those placement points. I also think that in this region, having that many divisions divides the player base too much and that there should be three divisions in total to prevent too much player division causing extreme queue times.

And with the recent updates made to balance competitive play, they should introduce this to balance competitive play in the Asia region, instead of focusing on trivial balancing such as removing stretched and capping FPS.",FortniteCompetitive

* JAM_zoreh &amp; JAM Gheez(OCE) were on top for the first six games and then there was a close competition between them and CoverH &amp; MF Twizz with the latter coming out on top.
* The domination and consistency of NRG benjуfishу &amp; NRG MrSavageM(Europe) and Secret_Mongraal &amp; Atlantis Mitr0 can be easily seen in the graph. Solary Airwaks &amp; Solary Nîkof had the same level of consistency for the first four games but after that MrSavageM, benjyfishy, Mongraal and Mitr0 were in a league of their own.
* Games 5 and 6 scoring 18 and 20 points back to back put W7M pfzin &amp; W7M-Nicks(Brazil) into a big lead after which they were 23 points ahead of the second duo at the end of Game 7 and they ended up qualifying.
* 17 points in Game 7 put KEZKD &amp; GA_phung(NAE) in a 6 point lead which increased to an 8 point lead at the end of Game 8 but unfortunately they weren't able to play anymore games as they ran out of time. woofgang crimz &amp; OT Spadess got 14 points in their last game to get the top spot.
* CR.bell &amp; Scarlet No.1(Asia) were at 3rd position at the end of 9th game but ended up qualifying after a 14 point last game.
* Arkhram1x &amp; Bloom Falconer(NAW) got 16 points in their last two games to qualify. Worth noting that Rhux &amp; Pika and Cloud and kyzui were playing really well but couldn't finish all of their games.
* ThaiTanks &amp; Thomuss_ (NAW) got 33 points in their last two games in attempt to qualify but unfortunately fell 7 points short.

* CoverH &amp; MF Twizz(OCE), W7M pfzin &amp; W7M-Nicks(Brazil) and NRG benjуfishу &amp; NRG MrSavageM(Europe) were still first ranked even when sorted by average points per game.
* There were some team who had really good average points per game but only played 3 or 4 games so there is a decent chance of their average dropping had they played more games.
* benjyfishy and MrSavageM had average points per game of nearly 16 which is highest among all regions.

* Top 4 from Asia, NRG benjуfishу &amp; NRG MrSavageM, Secret_Mongraal &amp; Atlantis Mitr0(Europe) and W7M pfzin &amp; W7M-Nicks(Brazil) maintain their ranks even when we take only the best 5 games which just goes to show how consistent they were.
* littlе &amp; Ospreys Jay(NAW) got all of their points in 5 games and didn't get a single point in rest of their games.

* You can see NRG benjуfishу &amp; NRG MrSavageM and Secret_Mongraal &amp; Atlantis Mitr0(Europe) are just so far ahead of everyone in both aspects, kills and placements.
* Dmo &amp; Bizzle(NAE) had average of 6 kills per game but placement was quite low(~18 per game) and ended up at 19th place.
* Similar to benjy and Savage, you can see W7M pfzin &amp; W7M-Nicks(Brazil) had a very dominant performance.
* KEZKD &amp; GA_phung(NAE) deserve a mention for their super consistent performance. They had an average placement of less than 9 and placed within top 10 in 6 out their 8 games(11th and 43rd in other two). Unfortunately, they weren't able to complete their games as well and ended up just outside of top 3 by 1 point.

This game has ALOT to fix. Whether it be the RNG or the hamsterballs, I have an idea that may promote better gameplay in both competitive play and even pubs. 

1. A spawn pistol. Now imagine a pistol that you land with that does 15 to the body and 30 to the head. In my personal opinion this would rid a LOT of RNG issues by giving everybody who landed without a weapon a chance at survival. This can reward the good players in a healthy way and even the not so good players because it's better to die with a chance than it is to die with none. 

2. Decrease the variant of launch pads to blue in order to counter how strong Hamsterballs are. This is a counter because if they're more accessible then the thought process behind NEEDING a hamsterball or you won't get any points/win the game now gets equaled out by the fact that you can loot and get much more mobility. Makes not having a hamsterball still competitive!

3. The removal of stinks. I cannot offer a FIX for stinks because it's an item that should not be in the game. It's not really an item that can be countered thus making it pretty much impossible to play against when a team has 9+.. I understand why they're in the game however. To flush out 1by1 campers. So I suggest the idea to add a shotgun, that replaces another issue (the tac shotgun) that does solid wall damage. Think about this. A gray, green &amp; blue double barrel shotgun that can do 100 damage to structures. Why double barrel? Because its balanced. How? Well think about it like this. You can't use it like a heavy sniper because you'll have to reload it after you shoot it thus minimizing the DPS you'll output making the usage of the gun more strategic.. plus the fact that it's just 100 structure damage would mean that you can't just shoot once and boom your wall, but now you got to play mind games. This ride the game of it's most inconsistent gun while adding a gun that had a NON OP use (with of course a decreased damage output than the past double barrel, it should do 100 point blank range body with a severe drop off).

Let me know what you guys think, I feel like these are steps in the right direction &amp; I hope something changes soon for the sake of competitive integrity",FortniteCompetitive

He had dissapointing results in Secret Skirmish,Katowice,WR,and TC, but he has a bit of an ""excuse"" for all of those. For WR there was the sword which griefed one of his games and also planes. In TC there was redeploy and moving zones which COMPLETLY changed the game. And in Katowice, his drop spot got yoted. For a very methodical player like poach, change is not good. He also got 11th in the blackheart cup and got around 125th in week 1. Poach isn't washed up like people say.

1. Remove unnecessary guns - grey pistols, thermals etc just add to the rng, please just go already

2. Ballers - no skill , high reward.

3. Heavy Sniper and Bow - Too strong, requires less skill (suppressed is more balanced IMO

4. Trap Damage - 150 damage is way too much, 75 or maybe 100 is good enough

5. Scoring system - placement should be rewarded more

Now for some arena ones -

Reduce bus fare or increase placement. I cannot be asked to lose -4 bus fare with my duo, and come 7th place I only get 1 point + how many ever kills I got because bus fare ate all my points


Add an incentive to play arena - a user made a great concept on rewards for playing arena, it’ll probably bring more players and make current players have more of an incentive to not give up

Now for some tournaments

1. Mats on kiLL goes into inventory, not all of it only some

2. Increase time limit to play your matches, with it being impossible to get 10 matches in 3hours, people play aggressive and w key because they know they will not get all their matches in anyway, and this could ruin someone else’s game

But in the recent weeks and months, all that has been in this sub is complaints and more complaints. 

I understand you need to raise issues about the game, but if streamers that have a voice with thousands of fans can’t even change what the devs want for the game, what makes you so sure that you’ll change it?

It’s ridiculous how literally every day I come on here, and more complaints about the state of the game with shield for kill is gone from pubs.

Occasionally I’ll see useful videos on tips from guys that did well in arena and I appreciate that, but then you get guys with “solo champ” being a bunch of pricks in the comments saying people’s opinion isn’t valid because they aren’t good enough or if they ask a question.

I think it is bad, and you guys need to sort out your shit.

Start posting more useful tips for those who are trying to get into this kind of area and stop being so toxic when someone doesn’t have the same opinion as the majority of you guys do.

Even popular streamers say this sub is full of complaining..like how bad does your reputation have to be to end up like that.",FortniteCompetitive

I find it incredibly annoying the amount of times I accidentally edit my ""blue piece"" or ""pre-edit"" due to just playing on a controller. For example, if a player on a controller wishes to ""Edit-Pump"" someone these are the following steps they must do:
1) Press Circle/B to bring up build menu
2) Place Piece/Pieces
3) Press Circle/B to get out of build menu
4) Hold Circle/B or whatever button is set to edit (Mine is instant set on another button)
5) Press Circle/B to Confirm Edit
6) Pump
So in total if you want to fight someone and hit them with a clean edit you'd have to press Circle/B four times, and if you miss a single one of these buttons you may accidentally Pre-edit whatever piece you have selected even if you are looking no where near the ""blue piece"". I don't believe this is an incredibly difficult fix and Epic could easily add a *Pre-edit (ON/OFF)* setting. Us lowly controller players would highly appreciate this change and we because we could finally edit something while still having our build menu out instead of having to drop our blueprints and edit every single time.",FortniteCompetitive

The skill gap was so big for Ninja, but now I see Ninja on every Fortnite Clips channel. He is actually insane, and he should compete against pros again. After all the hate he went through, He shot through it. Can we just have some love for Ninja?

This clip [https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingSuperHeronPastaThat](https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingSuperHeronPastaThat)  and other multiple clips changed my opinion on Ninja. He is playing incredibly, I think he deserves more credit... I haven't heard him complaining like Tfue and other streamers, I think Reverse2k made a good decision on his duo. 

Help this post grow so others can realise Ninja's improvement. He deserves everything...",FortniteCompetitive

When Fortnite came out on Switch the most requested feature was that motion controls be added, because Nintendo players knew that motion controls were great from playing on Breath of the Wild, or Splatoon.

Are all of the pro Splatoon players wrong on this? Is the Nintendo base wrong on this? 

If they're right about motion controls being the superior option, then why aren't we calling for it in Fortnite on other platforms?

I feel like a lot of people still think it's like waving a Wii remote at the TV, but it's so much more advanced than that now with improved tech. It's often described as the next best thing to mouse and keyboard.

The playstation controller has the right hardware, so shouldn't we want it on PS4 and PC?

I'm someone that loves motion controls but wants the superior performance of the other platforms. It'd be great to see other people on board. Epic plz.",FortniteCompetitive

I need advice on improving accuracy.,"Whenever I'm fighting people, it honestly feels like I'm the only person in the world that doesn't have 100% headshot accuracy. It seems like 90% of my deaths are one pumps from 200 health and the other 10% are being lasered so fast I can't even react. I'll outbuild somebody, land 5 or 6 30 damage pumps, then die in one hit. I've actually had a personal low of 5% accuracy on Aim Hero reflex training once. I've been PC gaming for close to 15 years and I've been playing on Tfue's sensitivity for the last 9 months with a desk-size mouse pad. I have 5,000~ matches played and I still can't hit the broad side of a barn.",FortniteCompetitive

This has kind of been my plan:

-I always go to lazy lagoon for the mats and balls (I get at least one spawn about 50% of the time I think)
-I win about 2/3 early game fights at the pirate ship
-If I try to w-key based on my load out I can usually get 3-4 kills and then die
-If I try to go for placement I can usually get top ten with maybe 1 or 2 picks
-I’d say I’m decent at all of the aspects of the game (aiming, building, game sense) but I’m by no means amazing

I just feel like I have a hard time getting to the next level in terms of my skill and I’m not quite sure what to do, I have tried solo duoing with some success as well as I do zone wars and 1v1s. So any tips on how to get better or to get to champs league would be much appreciated!",FortniteCompetitive

I've been on 60hz for years now. I saw the post from a week or so ago where an edit for a guy didn't go through because he had low fps. So I finally went to 144hz. Holy crap. It's like butter! It's insane. I can't tell you how many ""phantom"" edits I've had where I swore I completed it and it didn't go through. I immediately shaved a full minute off the edit course I had been doing. Objects were way easier to hit too, I didn't realize how much they stuttered when moving at high speeds.

You could still get good chip damage in if you can throw it before they notice, since it’ll go off before they can build. They could instead be primarily used as a way to block certain areas off from other players during endgame rotates or for positioning midgame/endgame. Perfect balance imo",FortniteCompetitive

You can no longer even hot drop to warm up the fighting muscles/reflexes.

The only way you can play the game in a similar fashion to the competitive version of the game is to farm for a solid 300+ seconds of the game. I farmed ONLY palettes at the new block for 180 seconds (3 min) and still was only 800 wood.

FUck life per kill, im fine at 60 hp, just let me build early game when I dont have time to farm due to a continuous onslaught of people pushing early game.

Further, discos are prioritized over all other throwables and we make these bastards dance then light them up. (Side note, been holding onto discos and they’re incredibly useful in arena solos)

I know that I won’t qualify for World Cup, but playing competitively is way more fun for me than pubs. The problem I face is getting kills in division 6 arena and events. For example, me and my duo partner got 30ish placement points in the warm up event but only 7 kill points.
I recently got my SCUF and grinded creative til muscle memory kicked in. We both are good players and our coms are pretty decent too, but every Engagement feels like a 50/50 situation, that we obviously don’t wanna take.
This started in division 6, I got back to back 8 kill wins in division 4. I watched hundreds of hours of competitive controller gameplay and think I can replicate a lot of movement patterns and trains of thought .

""Snipers take skill, you have to lead the shot"" etc

But what they fail to realise is that it doesn't matter if it ""takes skill"", a snipe could be the easiest thing to hit or it could be the hardest, as long as there is no counter for them, it is overpowered.

People also like to say,

""Why all of a sudden are snipers overpowered, you just want something to complain about""

However if you've played BR games before Fortnite you would know that Snipers have always been very controversial in BRs, H1Z1 even made the sniper exclusive to supply drops and PUBG made the only sniper that could one shot when you have full armour exclusive to airdrops too. This could be a simple solution(?) for Fortnite too in my opinion.",FortniteCompetitive

But I hear it on every stream these days - literally anything bad happens and it's either ""this game is trash"" or ""ugh I'm getting stream sniped(while landing frosty or some other hyper popular spot)"" or whatever else negativity they spout off with. Maybe I'm just being salty here, but as someone who is not good enough to be a pro but daydreams about it and wishes I could be that more than anything, hearing people who are out there living THE ACTUAL ENTIRE DREAM just complaining endlessly and saying they don't even like the game is extremely grating. And I can't seem to find streamers that DON'T do this. Getting salty now and then and saying something is one thing - we all do it - but constant, never ending complaining on stream, in a way that mostly comes across as complaining that you aren't winning, is really getting on my nerves.

&amp;#x200B;

I, for one, love this stupid game, and it has problems and we want them fixed, duh. We all know that. But I just wish the popular competitive players, who I enjoy watching, just wouldn't complain so much, and wouldn't blame \*EVERYTHING\* on some kind of bug or stream sniping or lag or whatever. I'm sorry, but when you react to literally every single person who pushes you by saying you're getting stream sniped, I really just don't want to hear it anymore. Even when people win they'll still say 'well that game was dogshit' in a frustrated tone after winning a game with double digit kills while playing in the finals for a half million dollar tournament. Who wants to hear that shit? It makes it less fun to watch, and it MUST not be fun to act like that either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this'll probably get removed or whatever but I just felt like complaining a little myself. Is anyone else out there wishing streamers would quit whining so frikkin much?",FortniteCompetitive

I'm not a streamer, but I do find it annoying that people clout chase and generally act like tools ruining streamer's games. Using Tfue as an example, he's barely playing Arena because of the number of stream snipers that casually enter his games. 

Assuming that all hit boxes are equal, I think streamer mode when turned on should put a different skin on the streamer's character server side to the one they are wearing client/streamer side. This would add an extra layer of protection when snipers go hunting for streamers in games.

I am eventually upgrading to a gaming pc so the compatibility with ps4 will only be temporary but necessary for the mean time.

3) I get way over 200fps on my PC, do fps isn't an issue. My keybinds are perfect and I know them by reflex. Season 3 player so got the practice.

4) do I need to play all matches in weekend cups to place for the Sunday finals? How does it work? I see people with 3 matches played who qualify for the Sunday finals.

&gt;!One situation we downed a player, his teammate revived him but as soon as they were both low hp, they turtled for as long as they could to stall us not getting the kill, then left the match. Another situation I was 1v1ing someone, had him 1 hit and he rifted so I stayed up in the air with him assuming he was eventually going to land and I could just get my kill. A few seconds in his character was frozen in the air, that's when I noticed he disconnected to stop be from getting a kill lol.!&lt;

What I suggest is for players to have points deducted if they constantly leave matches, sort of like in Overwatch where you lose alot more SR for leaving a match than playing the game out and losing. Or to increase the timer on how long a player can be credited for a kill to 30 seconds? I used to see people leaving games in pop-up cups but since there are more online tournaments, people will abuse the shit out of it to indirectly sabotage people's chances on winning money.

2 per position 19-4

4 for third place

8 for second place

15 for first place

You get all the points from 99 to 4 plus 4, 8 or 15 if you're top 3 So a max of 79+30+15=124 points per position. 

Should see a few games played like this to see if any number changes are needed.

I wanted to reach for the ‘far’ wall, which already was placed, and instead it placed another wall/floor in front of it and puts the trap on that wall/floor.. I find it specially annoying in a 1x1x2 situation were you want to place it in the upper box and for some reason it creates a trap in de floor between the upper and lower level and now you got yourself trapped with no view / ability to get to your upper part of your structure.

This might have never happened to you guys, but the point is that these kind of ‘improvements’ should be optional for players Imo.

It proved to the world that it wasn’t going to be a 1 month trend like Pokémon Go or the yodelling kid. The game still has the most players in the world right now. 

With that being said though, let’s look at the money side of things. Only a small percentage of the Fortnite player base consists of genuine pro players. Most people play the game casually. In that case, since casuals are the target audience, wouldn’t the game be adjusted to appeal to them. 

I mean think about it the big tournaments happening are huge for epic. I’m sure they earn tons of twitch revenue for these huge tournaments and a large quantity of the viewer base are casuals admiring these “Fortnite Gods”.

Im my opinion, bringing ranked into the game had nothing to do with the community wanting ranked. It had everything to do with dividing the good players and the noobs. When Epic took out Siphon from pub matches, it made the pro community hate playing pubs. But noobs who aren’t too great at this game can get wins with ease due to the great amount of rng and the lower skill gap.

About a year ago, I remember watching streams hearing people say a huge reason they love Fortnite is because the devs listen to the community and make changes quickly. Well why don’t they do that anymore? Think back to when there was no pro scene. Everyone was around the same skill level. So when streamers tweeted at epic or said they wanted to see change, they got it because they spoke for the casual community. They don’t do that anymore as most of the big name players are competitive players. 

I’m probably gonna get shit on for ranting but this is just an opinion. I mean people think Epic is just dumb but what if they’re making decisions based on the larger population of the community. I mean I don’t have the numbers but I’m pretty sure majority of the players are casual bots. Therefore rng wins will only keep them playing the game for longer. So in the end, Epic’s goal isn’t to satisfy the pro players. Maybe they’re just trying to make majority of the player base happy.",FortniteCompetitive

Have kills be the main part of the points however you get a multiplier for your placement.

And then 10th-5th place you have a 1x multiplier (you get a point for each kill). And then 4th is 2x multiplier and 3rd is 3x multiplier and so on. I was thinking 1st could get a higher multiplier such as 10x instead of 5x but I’m not sure if this is too much.

Anyway, this is the general idea and I’m curious as to if you guys think this would be a good system (the multipliers could be adjusted but it’s just a rough idea).",FortniteCompetitive

The newest weapon that was added to our arsenal is the reversion of health and mats on kill and the increased mat cap. It now takes roughly 3x as long to hit mat cap. This means you have to farm all game or you have a high chance of reaching endgame bone dry. I would estimate that 99.9% of players do not have the patience to spend more than a minute farming during an any given match. This puts you at an extreme advantage, as you'll usually enter the final fight with 3000 mats vs somebody with 300 mats. Your health will also be at 200 vs their 50 because you were hiding all game while they were fighting.

&amp;nbsp;

As somebody that gets 1st or 2nd place in most of my matches, I can say definitively that the final player in each match is about 20% as skilled as before the patch. I believe this is due to the better players hot dropping for 20 bombs and dying off spawn. In most of my matches before the patch, the final player was 3KD minimum with about 20 kills. This equates to 1000 free healing and 3000 free mats throughout the course of the game. 99 players generating 150 mats on death means there was almost an extra 15,000 free mats floating around each game. No health on kill means that third partying the final player is even stronger than before. A surprising number of matches are ended by jumping out of the baller and pumping my enemy one time because their health is so low. The stink bomb strategy I discussed in my previous posts is lowkey broken. Most players will only have mini shields to heal with endgame, so they'll only have 10 health left and 50 shields when you engage them. Stink them out!

&amp;nbsp;

Now let's talk about approaching Fortnite with the correct mindset. You need to use BRAINS over brawn. Arena has done a great job filtering the better players out of pubs. While everyone is practicing for Worlds so they can rake in those millions, pubs have turned into a bot playground. What you need to do now is play the odds. Fortnite recently reached 250,000,000 registered players and only 100 are going to the tournament. That's not even 1 in a million chances! It's not even a 1 in 2 million chance! Quit daydreaming and get back on that pub grind. You may not be able to win an international tournament, but you can sure as Hell pump up those stats.",FortniteCompetitive

I see a lot of people both here, and on the main subreddit act like there are only two types of FortNite players.

1. You are a very skilled competitive PC player.

2. You are a casual/console player/a player that does not care about the state of the game competitively or in general.

As a console player, I understand that I will not compete with PC players in Arena, that is obvious.

But, I am not a clueless player that just wants to wear a banana skin and dance in the middle of tilted and then complain about being killed.

It doesn't matter if they aren't allowed to compete for money, the game just needs a separate ranked mode that isn't connected to things like the world cup, so that they can have platform exclusive matchmaking.

Because public matches just are an absolute horrible experience for nearly any type of player and is just unenjoyable, but at the same time, Arena mode does not appeal to me because it will put me up against PC players.

Some people will say ""If playing against PC players is too much for you, you just shouldn't be playing ranked/you're just bad.""

This is just ridiculous, playing against players like Tfue as a console player is just an objective unfair gameplay experience.

So, I don't want to play Arena, but public lobbies aren't fun, so what am I supposed to do?

I hope you guys can understand that even if a player is a console user, or if they even don't play at all, it is still possible to care about the game's competitive state and about the game in general.

Everyone is saying that you should be rewarded for being more skilled at the game and that new players should just practice and become better. 

Why does this not apply to the better/more skilled players? The same people, not all of them but a large group, complaining about the above issue are saying they can’t play arena because they aren’t good enough. Well if you aren’t good enough to play arena why don’t you just get better at the game yourself?

I’m perfectly fine with the increased mats to 999, I wish the farm rate wasn’t reduced, and I fully agree about the removal of 50 health/shield. 

2/3 of this update was perfectly fine but it is annoying to have to farm for nearly double the time at, what now feels like, a reduced rate.

Am I missing something here?

Chap is right, none of us are going to qualify.","Recently, there has been a lot of beef between console and PC players, after Chap said that all console players are not going to qualify for worlds. Personally, as a big Chap fan, I think this could have been worded better, but what he said is fundamentally correct.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, people are getting mixed up between controller players and console players. People who play console are people who play on either Xbox or PlayStation. Very good and well known controller players like Aydan and Issa, play on PC, with a controller. Get that in your head. 

In any qualifying game there will be 50+ people in late zones. It doesn't matter if you have the Xbox One X or whatever the PlayStation equivalent is, you can not compete with the 10 fps that you get. 

Being on controller is already a disadvantage, due to the lack of buttons and the low level of accuracy that can be achieved by using the shitty plastic stick that we know and love. Sure, aim assist helps with that, but the aim that can be achieved with a mouse can not be matched with a controller. Kb&amp;m players can use their whole desk to aim, while we have 1cm either side of the piece of plastic. If aim assist was really as powerful as salty streamers say it is, then we would see a majority of controller players qualifying and placing highly in big tourneys. Instead, we are the minority in tournaments and it is very unusual to see one of us place highly.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Everyone needs to shut up and stop bitching about small things like this. Console players are most likely not going to qualify for worlds and that needs to be accepted. If you feel the need to exert your daily dose of toxicity towards someone, go to Epic's twitter and tell them to fix their game. Thanks.",FortniteCompetitive

If I buy a console, I know I'm at a disadvantage but I shouldn't be disqualified from competitions just because I don't have enough money to buy a PC.",FortniteCompetitive

I can not attest to this actually working as no one but pros has been able to contact him / purchase his service.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, from what I have seen he has tweeted that following his friend and DM'ing them will get you the guide on how to boost your FPS. From my personal experience this did not work, although I cannot attest to others. Most recently, he has tweeted to go and follow a twitch user and once completed a bot will DM you a guide on how to boost your FPS, this was also false. After about 30 minutes he deleted the tweet.

&amp;#x200B;

To me it seems like he is using his new found twitter fame to bait people seeking an FPS boost into following other users, while not completing his part of the deal. I'm sure his service works as there are many pros tweeting about him, but if he is baiting followers than that seems pretty scummy.

(My opinion as an ex-console player).,"\[Just as a little background story\]:  I started casually playing this game late season 2, and began taking it seriously pretty quick. Got to be pretty good on PS4, around a 5.5KD and then I was told to switch to PC because I was told that the ""big boys"" played there. At first I thought it was bs and kept playing console for a few more months till I decided to switch to controller on PC and..boy oh boy did I get surprised. 

I started getting my cheeks clapped left and right and my kd went from 6 down to 3 the first few weeks. From not having a single person take high ground on me to pretty much losing it everytime or not even getting it in the first place. Took me about a month to feel like a decent player against PC players.

Every single player seemed much better mechanically, but on top of that they were smarter and knew how to actually play the game. (ofc there are still bots, but bots are bots no matter the platform). The average player is so much harder to kill, and the top players are on a whole different league. My KD is now around 4-4.5 and it will most likely never get back up to what it was on console.

Now, I don't if Epic aren't aware of this huge gap, or they just simply decide to ignore, but let's be honest here...no console player is even gonna make it to top 3000 let alone qualify for WC so I really can't understand the last few decisions they've made regarding the whole ""evening out the playing field"" when there's nothing to even out in the first place. 

The only competent controller players switched from console to PC a long time ago, and now console should really be considered a ""casual platform"" as no one who competes against mediocre players is ever going to get anywhere in the comp scene.",FortniteCompetitive

If we split lobbies competitively, pc and console get their own, does console deserve a fair share of the  total prize money? Just tell me what you think in the comments.

I wanna give my bias opinion since I’m a console player on how I feel on all this. On console we are using an inferior hardware and a controller to your rig and mnk. Advantage will always be for pc. A console player isn’t gonna qualify for Worlds and a controller player isn’t gonna win it. That’s just my opinion. Too much going against us. I feel comfortable saying this now. We were always fighting an uphill battle and I think it’s time we surrender and ask to split off from pc competitively. But what I ask in the split is for a fair piece of the total prize money. I don’t see why console can’t have their own LAN tournaments and get good prize money for them. The way I see it is that vbucks pay for these tournament money. The console community is very large and buy a whole lot of vbucks. So why is it that that money goes towards pc tournaments and not console tournaments. Why were we ever grouped up in the first place? I’ve been hearing split lobby lately and I’ve been saying yeah. 100% split lobby. But whenever I say split the money too I keep hearing don’t do that. Tell me how that’s right? Tell me how that’s fair? I can’t square the part where console can go somewhere else but pc can keep all the money and we don’t get shit despite paying a huge amount of it.

Every true competitor will use every single advantage in any sport, video game, etc. To get an edge of the competition. The ONLY reason that a competitive player might choose to go another route is preference. For example, I play with a controller on PC, because I personally don’t want to switch to keyboard. I know that it’s a disadvantage, but I can accept that because I’m comfortable and don’t complain about playing competitively against keyboard and mouse players.

Cross platform competitive just isn’t going to work. I’m not sure how queue times would work, but if competitive PC players are forced to sacrifice to “even the playing field” with console players who have almost zero chance of competitive at the highest level, we’re in trouble.    

To me it seems that the players that are influencing these decisions haven’t actually played any competitive video games or sports in their lives. A true competitor is always looking for ways to get a edge, not making excuses as to why they can’t keep up.

Yet I turn off anti aliasing and I legit get doubled FPS 
 
And Sony will never allow you guys to turn that off. 
 
I'm sorry but someone had to say it. 
 
Your dreams of 100+ FPS by turning off shadows is just that... a dream",FortniteCompetitive

As you can imagine I’m a complete bot, but have played arena mode to the point I’m at division 3. Although I know this division is low and the players won’t be skilled, I’m still far worse then 90% of them and can’t de rank at all so I’m stuck dying over and over until I somehow improve enough to play the game. Pubs are as we know also complete shit so besides playing creative to improve I’m really lost with this game ",FortniteCompetitive

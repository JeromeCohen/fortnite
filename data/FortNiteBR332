I have enabled all the required ports and have 30ms ping so I am unsure if it is my connection.

I have messaged support, but as usual I was ignored by them.

Please make the gun inneffective when jumping cuz it just ruins the game imo. After playing 1 or 2 games of this I want to go back to PUBG cuz of all the insane pro gamers who one shot me with shotguns. These shotguns are too powerful please make the pistol and smgs more powerful and nerf the shotguns as they don't require that much skill to get an easy one or two shot kill and that is not good gunplay for a video game. Epic if you want twelve year olds who spend 12 hours a day on this game one shotting everyone in sight be my guest but I think this is a terrible way for a game to be.

Rules: 
The hosting team will host a SQUAD game session. Then they will invite his teammate, and their opponents to the game session and then begin their match.

How to win: For this tournament you will play two games. Each game you must keep track of your kills for each game played. The combined amount of kills for each game will determine which team will win the match. If out of the two games played the kills are tied a third map will be played to determine a winner for the match.

If people are interested we will put it a lot more in depth and add plenty of well balanced rules. It will just be for fun and no prices.

No hate comments, please. If you have nothing nice to say then don't comment, I don't want any negativity.

Well, Judging by how many kills I get it's like 0-4 (Yes I know, I suck but I play for fun)

Yeah getting eliminations is a good way to level up, 50 XP a kill.

Every match I get like 300-400 XP, Almost 500 in the 50 v 50.

I got the battle pass since Wednesday and I was level 15 by the time, Now I am level 38, I'm playing the game 24/7

When you complete all the weekly challenges you get a total of 50k XP

the XP from the battle pass is totally a letdown, 1k XP? Wish it would give you as much XP on a certain level instead.

After you complete all the weekly challenges you get a total of 50+10 extra hidden battle tiers, When you complete dailies every day for 51 days that's a total of 25 battle tiers so in total you get 85. (You don't have to worry about the battle tiers because you will eventually get to 100 after the weekly challenges and by leveling up.)

25k XP in 50 days when you do dailies.

What if some people be level 55 at the end of the season? Will you allow us to spend v-bucks for the rest of the armour pieces in the shop?

IMO I don't mind grinding my way to level 80 and battle pass 100. I feel bad for the people that have jobs and can't play this game for 4 or 6+ hours and can't grind enough to get to the goal.

Make your concerns known to Twitch.,"I assume most of you know about Faze Tfue and what unjust punishment he has had. For those who don't ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf3W5bLAE2g) :

Twitch streamer Tfue has been banned for 30 days for calling a character he was chasing a 'coon'. In the video you see him chasing a twitch prime skin, which arguably resembles a racoon, and calling him the short version of it; Coon. So far so good. Coon is also a deragotory term used to desribe black people, the same way the n-word is used(I hate to call it that, but I'm afraid it gets cencored if I use it). While the video doesn't give you a clear way of distinguishing with 100% certainty what Tfue actually means, Twitch decided that the appropriate penalty for this is banning someone for 30 days. With doing so they implicitly admit that they think he said something racist.

My main concern with this is the fact a organization as influential as Twitch gets to decide what is racist and what is not, in a clearly very ambiguous situation. I think this is a gateway to more fuzzy thinking and arbitrary decisionmaking. I've done a bit of research, and apparently Twitch has a history of being inconsistent in how they punish misbehaviour, but also in providing sufficient argumentation for the severity of the punishment.

I've already send them a letter in which I adress these concerns and I would ask you to do the same. I think they should have a more transparent policy concerning these kind of decisions, because they can have a real effect on individuals. And these decisions shouldn't been taken on the suspicion of racism in a truly ambiguous clip.

Thanks for reading

Tldr: Twitch has gone too far in punishing and judging Tfue words as racist. I think everybody needs to let Twitch know they have made a grave mistake.",FortNiteBR

I just installed Fortnite yesterday with friends to try it after playing many hours of PUBG. It really looks fun, especially animations and idea of building, but gameplay is retarded. Everyone is jumping and jumping, where is the fun here? It's everything about how good you are on jumping and placing platforms (while jumping of course). We got like 3 times in 6 games a situations when enemy team of kangaroos was rushing for us, but we could not even hit them because that shit idea of bouncing every move you do. I understand that jumping was cool in Quake series, but this is just stupid and unnecessary.  
I'm still waiting for over year for release of Defense mode for free, wasn't interested in another BR, but it doesn't look that bad that we thought. Of couse except this what i asked in title; we just can't handle this and we don't have fun by playing that.

I'm a double pump player, but I have a ping that is beetween 60 and 90ms most of the time.
Switching beetween weapons with this ping can't be done as fast as a player with a very low ping (like streamers), which gives imo a big advantage to players with a low ping as shown in this video :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEmhNNVHl20&amp;feature=youtu.be

Low ping players can have a very fast double pump, this gives them a very high dps potential that can't be done with a higher ping.",FortNiteBR

I'm normally able to keep my temper as long as someone else is with me even if I die in a ridiculous way or miss all of my shots. However, solos is just so different. When none of my friends are on I can't even touch fortnite because it feels like a completely different game. Every shot I miss, everytime I land and I don't get a weapon from RNG, it just makes me feel absolutely terrible about myself even though I know it shouldn't. I suppose this also happens in other games from my experience, but its amplified in fortnite because when working so hard to get to the top 10 or somewhere around there, dying and losing all progress might as well be the same as getting beaten up \(as silly as it sounds\). Fortnite just feels like the perfect storm to make me feel as useless and terrible as I possibly can be and even though this is super petty, some of my darkest thoughts stem from soloing. So in general, how do other people enjoy solos? What is it they do to keep calm and just have fun? ",FortNiteBR

I downloaded this game 2 days ago in the effort to connect/spend time with my younger siblings while I'm in med school. After my first few games, I'm happy to say I'm hooked!

Went and bought the battle pass and a couple skins on the shop for my siblings and myself and saw that the Omega skin was available. After looking at some pictures of the fully upgraded skin, I decided I'd love to own it but don't want to commit to the game unless it's possible for someone like me.

Like I mentioned, I'm in school right now and don't have the time to play like most people on this subreddit. I can and have completed most of the challenges but being so new, I'm having a very difficult time even getting a kill on someone despite having the drop on them.

I looked up a few ""calculators"" for this season but everything is still confusing for me. I'm currently level 30 and tier 31. I primarily play to complete challenges (which is a struggle for me) and not really to win the games.

I was just hoping if I could enlist some help from any experienced member who could help guide me to getting to my goal or straight up tell me that it's unattainable. I'd be happy to shoot you a small itunes gift card for your time!

I will delete this post so it doesn't take up anyone's time once my questions have been answered! I know people don't like newbie posts like these.

Thanks everyone!",FortNiteBR

Shotguns are already extremely strong in close range on their own - why is there an exploit in the game that doubles the damage output of them? If you're using the pump and miss you shouldn't be able to whip another shotgun out and just start firing away. The reason the pump has a delay is because it has the one shot potential. Epic, please remove the double shotgun exploit.",FortNiteBR

*FOR FUCKS SAKE, CAN SOMEONE AT EPIC JUST ADD SKILL\-BASED MATCHMAKING TO THE NORMAL QUEUE?*

It's ridiculous now. You have absolute potatoes who might as well just uninstall and people with a fucking IV tube of Ninja's streams going directly into their aorta... *in the same goddamn game.* This needs to stop **now.**

What is so ***OBSCENE*** about matching players with people of ***THEIR FUCKING SKILL?!***

What is so ***HORRIFIC*** about giving the worse players some kind of chance to win?

What is so ***TERRIBLE*** about matching tryhards with other tryhards?

***WHAT IS SO FUCKING TABOO ABOUT ADDING AN INTERNAL MMR?!***

*""B\-but* [*u/SaunsTehSkeletun*](https://www.reddit.com/u/SaunsTehSkeletun)*! This will kill the game!""*

No. It won't. If anything, it would make the game better. Queue times are a small price to pay for an actually fair game.

*""B\-b\-but pros would have longer queue times!""*

No they will not. Have you seen how many pros there are in Fortnite right now? Not to mention the MASSIVE playerbase. They'll have queue times just as long as any other player would.

*""But Epic did a survey a few months ago! People don't want it!""*

Yes, they did a survey... **a few months ago.** When that survey was posted, the game hadn't been out for that long. Now, the skill gap is just too large for random matchmaking.

*""But smurfs!""*

You can't smurf for long with internal MMR, mate. It would balance out essentially after one game.

*""Solo Showdown!""*

That, in no way, will ever kill off the amount of tryhards and sweatys in any of the non\-LTMs. That's why queue times in Solos aren't horribly at the moment.

In conclusion, the skill gap is just too big now. It’s near impossible coming into this game as a noob to compete against people playing since day 1. If you go back to when the game first came out pretty much nobody built. Everybody learned to build together and they all improved together. Now, the skill gap is so high it’s too difficult to improve; You’re dead in the blink of an eye. We need to put an end to this, and fast.",FortNiteBR

If you haven’t played before the Turbo Build update (preferably before S1) don’t reply to this, you can’t compare.

Things we want removed or altered:

Port a fort removed

Weapon delay decreased heavily, it should stay between the pumps to prevent double pumping.

Auto material change removed

Hop Rocks removed

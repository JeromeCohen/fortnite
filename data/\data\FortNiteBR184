It could be the male+female back bling for one skin or a completely different pair for each. Also, the second back bling could be replaced with a contrail, like the one we saw on Ravage.

Please be nice to everyone and stay on topic in the comments and give more ideas if you have any. Thanks",FortNiteBR

I don't like being able to get styles after the season. Season 4 did it right. I think we should need to grind to get a style to show that were devoted and that we actually earnt it.

While I think the XP system needs a huge revamp (xp for eliminations increased) getting to tier 100 is too easy and I went from being scared of max tier omegas to seeing a max Ragnarok and going ""huh they might be decent"" 

This is a wildly unpopular opinion but I want to EARN my skins not have them handed to me for ringing doorbells.

86,emohlman16,1540330072,9qtbsd,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9qtbsd/how_epic_games_should_handle_events/,1,How Epic Games should handle events.,"I think that Epic games should completely revamp how events work in Battle Royale. I have broken this system down into 3 parts. (sorry about the formatting im on mobile)

Part 1: The Event Pass

Battle pass owners will receive an event pass, a 25 tier pass with a free and paid pass, similar to the battle pass. To tier up, you will get event tiers from the event challenges (see part 2) In the free pass, there will be loading screens,  access to exclusive ltms, and at the very end, a event themed menu music. (Christmas bus music, anniversary music etc.) For the paid pass, there will be the classic battle pass filler like loading screens, vbucks, player icons, and emotes, and at the very end, you will get a choice between 3 event skins of equal rarity, and the other two that you don't pick will be available in the item shop while the event goes. (you have to have  gotten tier 25 in the event pass to have access to these items)

Part 2: The Challenges

During each week of an event there will be challenges with exclusive rewards for each week. these challenges will grant xp and event tiers. The first week will be free for everyone, but the rest will only have 3 of 7 challenges free. All the others will require the event pass. Once you complete all the challenges for a week you will get a These exclusive rewards will be similar to the crowbar for the getaway, and the birthday cake backbling for fortnites anniversary.

Part 3: The event itself

All events will last for 30 days, and have 4 weeks of challenges. If you complete all 4 weeks worth of challenges, you will receive a weapon skin exclusive to the event (snowball launcher, gravedigger, etc).
the ltms included in the pass will all be obtainable for free players, and won't be difficult to obtain.

Thanks for reading this huge wall of text, and I'm open to feedback and suggestions

TL;DR: A suggested formula for events that use a event pass similar to the battle pass.

I think they are trying to cater to the more casual players, but we have the 50's for that, I understand it's gone, but it will more likely come back.

I am getting a lot better at this game now after putting in the time, but fall damage is something we need to have because it really effects your decision making.

If you are getting shot down you have to think on the spot. If you get shot down with glider re-deploy, you then can just fly away without having to worry about fall damage.

I feel like there's a place for glider re-deploy and that is 50's or different game modes. When you have the more competitive game modes and the areas where people are trying to really work on their game play, the fall damage is a necessity because it helps with your decision making. ",FortNiteBR

This way, if a player is caught off guard and shot down from high ground, the player would not be able to deploy their glider.

But if the player is trying to make faster rotations and builds a few levels up and jumps, then they are allowed to deploy.

An alternative condition would be if you are only able to deploy when jumping/walking off a structure that can built on. (Builds that are being destroyed because of having no connection to the ground cannot be built onto, and thus would not allow glider deployment)

These options would promote more player mobility, but would still punish players from building recklessly high. ",FortNiteBR

Also, the challenge clearly states ""Eliminate opponents near any of the Corrupted Areas,"" but there is no specification as to what ""near"" means exactly. Not to mention they don't mention that the eliminations have to be at different CAs. Which is the biggest, problem, IMO. I have gotten multiple elims at multiple CAs, but only the first counts.

I used a photo-editing app called Snapseed to create a revised Fortnite map, with only the best POIs included. I used maps from Season 3, 4 and 5, including Dusty Depot and the factories, Risky Reels and Lazy Links, and of course, Moisty Mire. Sorry for the low quality. Also, I would’ve included the Haunted Hills castle, but I couldn’t find a Season 6 map without POI names on it. Enjoy!

These .5 k/d with 8 lifetime win players that sit in towers, bushes, bathrooms, and other idiotic spots, are getting really annoying.

It's not that they are even playing smart, they are playing scared. Not taking fights to get better, but instead shooting at other people who are fighting, because it's the easiest way for them to get a kill.

I let people build fight when I see something sweaty going on, it's lame to shoot people down or laser them when fighting someone. I hate it when it happens to me, so I'm not going to do it to others. 

With a ranked queue, I could really see the third party shooting dropping down to a minimum. At higher ranks, people are going to conserve ammo/rockets/mats, much like pro scrims.

The game mode hopefully will have less 10 story one-by-ones and more people thinking about how to use mats

On the other side we have the people that just didnt make the cut and couldnt unlock it and are still pretty sad because of it :-)

I personally never use the skin so I honestly do not care if it returns but I might have the sollution for the people that have it and the people that still want it,

There could be an extra challenge next season for the people that still want to unlock the lights, this challenge will be: reach level 80.

This means that it will be a challenge again, so the people that have it wont be able to say the usual : oh noes I grinded so hard for that thing and now they get it for free. 

Im very curious to the reactions its just a simple morning idea!

i will not make any speculations on what happens farther than what we are directly being shown in the game. i feel a lot of people are missing the connections of the small map changes with the overall story.


* comet shows up in the sky

* gatherings of telescopes appear across the map

* a bunker shows up in wailing woods

* asteroid crash lands at dusty divot after breaking the screen at a newly built drive-in theatre as well as destroying the prison

* small shards of the rock are spread across the map which grant better aerial mobility

* a new movie starts to film and sets pop up around the map, including  a villain base equipped with a missile

* the visitor emerges from the asteroid 

* the shards are collected by the same company sponsoring, directing, or featuring in the film and taken to the base, also the same one working on the asteroid at dusty divot

* the visitor launches the rocket up into the sky, then in comes down aimed at tilted towers but before it hits, it disappears and a blue abnormality shows up. the rocket then shows up over moisty mire and zooms around the map and vanishes once again by greasy grove. then it spawns over loot lake, shoots up into the sky, and creates a giant rift

* durr burger head, NOMS sign, tomato head, motel sign, and lonely lodge signpost  disappear after a small rift engulfs them

* durr burger shows up in the real world in the california desert

* drift is teleported from our world to fortnite

* a new desert shows up where moisty mire was, a new viking ship shows up by greasy grove, a golf course shows up in between 
tomato town and the motel, NOMS signs shows up on a hill by risky reels and wailing woods, durr burger shows up on a hill by loot lake, stone heads show up across the map along with small rifts

* a small stone tomato head shows up where the original was

* tomato town is transformed into tomato temple

* pink lightning begins to strike cacti on a plateau in the desert

* a final strike of lightning hits the middle of the plateau and continues more intensely and longer than previous strikes, a large pink cube forms 

* the cube, which grants shield to players and fights back, begins to roll around the map and print runs into the ground which become the center of low gravity zones

* the cube rolls into loot lake and melts, converting all of the water into a pink bouncy surface

* the pink liquid converges at the island in the middle of the lake which starts to rise, revealing the cube underneath and creating a massive wind storm 

* the low gravity zones become corrupted, now barren of life and covered in geysers. miniature floating pink cubes show up at corrupted areas which grant increased mobility as well as transparency

* Cabins show up in wailing woods. in the basements, there are secret facilities that have tunnels with dead ends

* a bunker is found under the hedge maze in wailing woods, a lab with rift is inside

* the island moves to the different corrupted areas, raising the runes into the air, and pumps energy into them. this makes the geysers radiate energy to propel objects into the air

* cubes begin forming in the house on the top of the island

* the island arrives at the final corrupted area and all of the other runes begin to raise out of the ground and travel to the island

* the island sucks energy from the runs and they fall to the ground

* the island goes back to loot lake and shoots a beam of light into the sky, creating a pink disk which steadily grows larger in diameter


**My Theory**

the visitor crash landed in dusty, recruited the help of escaped inmates to help gather hop rocks and create a distraction with the movie. he continued to work on his study of crossing dimensions in his bunker in wailing woods to stay away from trouble. he then launches the rocket, using the hop rocks to increase the speed, and creates a rift in the dimension. he travels on the rocket carrying hop rocks and himself back to his home. he then builds a weapon or creates a method to send the cube, a block of energy created from hop rocks, back to fortnite. the cube travels to areas of high energy around the map and finally the lake to build up more energy at those places. keep in mind that these map changes and cube areas are ones that have been involved in the meteor crash or the rocket/rifts. he then uses the island to gather more energy and finally sends a beam into the sky. this will (prolly not) create a dome where the fortnite world is like his own.

why else would he have that stupid helmet on?

tl;dr: visitor came to fortnite to harness the power of the hop rocks to make the map like his home. he just wants to renovate ",FortNiteBR

For example, inviting other players to your party while you're in game? Feel like that would be very useful to everyone, from the players in playground to the ones in a squad game in the top 10 and don't want to wait on that one friend who's going afk in 5 mins and will be gone for who knows how long coincidentally right after your game (and yes that is from experience). Along with that, i feel like ""Join Party Game"" could be added, kind of like how rocket league has it where if you joined the party after the game has already started you'll be able to join the game while it's in progress, that could be disabled for normal games but it's still great for playground. Finally we get to rejoining a game if you disconnected (had your internet go out or your fortnite crashed) everyone has had at least one time where they've lost internet in the middle of a fortnite game and had to tell their friend with 10 kills to leave the game because they didn't want to wait. This would be such a useful change in fortnite, as so many players would love it! PUBG has a similar feature that allows you to join back if you crashed, though it isn't perfect, it's still better than nothing. If these 3 changes could be implemented i'm sure fortnite will receive plenty of positive feedback for this, have a good day to everyone who took the time to read this &lt;3",FortNiteBR

It doesn’t help that folks everywhere are encouraging camping, tunnel vision, spamming, and every other negative aspect of the game. 

I’ve grown tired of the thirstiness and the constant rage because of how cheap some people play so I’ve decided to move on. This game is still super fun and pretty great but like everything, people are constantly making a good thing go bad. 

Maybe I’ll be back, I’ll still monitor this sub, I can’t anticipate myself coming back unless they buff shotguns or make some core mechanic changes. There hasn’t been any gun/damage changes over the past month, they’ve added stuff like the grappler and quad launcher but guns that were already in the game have remain untouched and thus, the game has grown incredibly stale.

I don't remember combat variety ever being this bad in Fortnite.  It almost feels like ARs are useless with how infrequently they can get you a kill.  This is resulting in a pretty stale meta.

You (Epic) declared it was going to be an e-sport, along with stating the fact that you had plans to have a Fortnite world cup.  You had a competitive game in which ARs had tight bloom and did damage and shotguns killed in one shot if you could aim.   There was a lot of dynamic with building that added the skill-gap and gave players a competitive edge when practiced.  Before I start this whole thing I'd like to give you a couple definitions.  First of all, there's skill.  The definition of skill is:  the ability to do something well; expertise.  Secondly, there's practice: *n.*  repeated exercise in or performance of an activity or *skill* so as to acquire or maintain proficiency in it.             *v.* perform (an activity) or exercise (a skill) repeatedly or regularly in order to improve or maintain one's proficiency. Lastly, there's exertion.  The definition of exertion being:  1. A physically or mentally, vigorous or determined attempt.  2.  the application of a force, influence, or quality.  Remember these.  Moving on...

&amp;#x200B;

The minigun was a cool addition, and I liked that it wasn't too good but rather nice for doing a little bit of damage to someone who's rushing you with mats.  SMGs did low damage and were inaccurate but had great fire rate, therefore they were good if you had picked them up right at the start of the game, so they had their place in the competition.  You added the LMG, and the bloom and damage made it basically a more close range minigun, which was still not too good but rather nice for someone building trying to get away or turtle.  Then you buffed the lmg, minigun, and smg.  You also added c4 and clingers.  All of this put together: Annoying, but I understand because I couldn't count on 2 hands the amount of times I just destroyed a 4 man squad alone just because they didn't know any building mechanics.  

&amp;#x200B;

Yet at the same time, you declared it to be an e-sport.  So shouldn't skill be the competitive edge?  The definition of a sport is:  an activity involving physical or mental *exertion* and *skill* in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.  If 1 person has, after being bad just like everyone else, decided that they want to get good at the game, and spent hours on hours of playing the game so they could match up to other players, (practice) while that 4 man is in the phase of whether or not they want to decide get good at the game or not, since it's an e-*sport*, the amount of time spent on trying to get to that point should be reflected when going up against that 4-man, and the 4-man can decide to be inspired to practice or disheartened to not want to play anymore, and that is when a player for an e-sport will either take the time to get good or just decide they're not cut out for it like many players before them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now we know that a sport involves exertion and skill, and you declared it to be an e-sport.  Those are two facts.   So why, in an honest question to an Epic Developer begging the answer to the question you all refuse to answer to your dedicated players, would you add things that placate new or not as skilled players with things that don't require any exertion or practice (without practice there is no skill) and instead require you to simply have it in your inventory, and has nothing to do with the amount of time you spent practicing the building mechanic, which is the mechanic that makes the game a competition that requires you to have an edge, in order to beat the player in said competition with their game-given edge (i.e explosives, spray, which require no *exertion* or time spent *practicing*, which develops *skill*).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even have to go into building changes, p90, morphing through walls, edit lag, bloom consistency, and minute other things that make this game no longer competitive.  Although, I will say that a spray meta with bloom in a game with building that has been declared an e-sport where you have nerfed shotguns (which is another area which eliminates RNG, in this case the RNG being bloom, and when RNG is eliminated by something that takes practice, it then creates a competitive edge) in which you had to just simply out shoot the player with the shotgun.  This, if practiced, eliminates someone being able to just hope their bloom works while holding mouse 1 or just throwing an explosive  The latter 2 of the 3 require no exertion or practice.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this, we should now all know that the changes have been consistent with the fact that they are consistently eliminating areas which require exertion/skill in a game that they have declared an e-sport.  The definition of sport involving, as we know, exertion/skill.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess with this I would just like to hear from a Dev themselves on whether or not Epic Games is still looking to fulfill their e-sports visions, and have strayed away from the very definition of sport unknowingly, or if Epic Games has made Fortnite a casual game in which they are just going to look to please as many players as possible.  Knowing this, I, personally, and many other dedicated players, can finally decide whether or not this game is still worth playing or to move on to something that dedication will actually benefit us.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some of us aspire to be competitive gamers, and whether that sounds corny to you or not, when developers consistently do this, it's disheartening.  Watching so many other games with high potential to be a simply fun, competitive game throw away all the potential for things like a world cup, TV coverage, media coverage, etc etc, which brings in lots of cash, for cash.  I think I speak for many when we just want you to be honest with us, and if one developer realizes that's the case they have the chance to make a game that'll change sports history.  I think of a lot of us thought you were going to be the first developer to really take that chance in stride and a lot of us are upset because you let us down.  That is all I have to say.  Without an answer I think it's safe to say I'm going to quit this game myself despite how much of my life I've sadly put into it with aspirations since COD, in which I actually did play in some big tournaments in, to someday play a competitive game that I sincerely enjoy competitively.

- Streamer Block: Prevent yourself from joining streamer infested lobbies.
- Weapon choice option: This would work similarly to the playground options, where instead of straight up vaulting items, give us the option to turn off the ones we hate (For me it’s all SMGs and the Double Barrel)
- Map choice option: Basically just go back to any season’s map. If you wanna bring back Dusty Depot, Anarchy Acres, Moisty Mire, and Loot Lake, the OG Dusty Divot, or the Season 1 map, then you can do that.

I can't tell you who I got my information from (a friend who works at Epic Games), but I have some confirmed information for you.

On Halloween day, all of the vaulted Fortnite items from the past are coming back for one day only!

It makes sense because Halloween focuses on the un-dead (coming back from the dead) such as zombies, ghosts, and skeletons. What else died? Vaulted weapons. Coming back for one day makes absolute sense.

You can find them in supply drops, chests, and ground loot.

There are three images so far. I will update this post based on the tweet tomorrow. There are some clues to what Fortnitemares will bring. It’s all in the words and some in the pictures. The first post contained the words: 
Costumes and dancing, 
Partner up, be wise. 
They could be friendly, 
Or a ghoul in disguise. 
https://imgur.com/a/dMpdfEH
The picture is a male skin that resembles a zombie Calamity. Calamity’s pickaxe is a wood stake, and we all know what that means. Wood stakes are often used to stab through the heart of a vampire to kill it. In this case, it could be Calamity’s evil twin brother. In the second post, we see kevin, but chained up, but he looks like he is vibrating and ready to explode. This could be related to the huge portal in the sky. https://imgur.com/a/w4Y2n9j Whatever is happening, it's bigger than the map changes at the beginning of season 6. There is also a scythe in the background of the image, but it is very faint. https://imgur.com/a/qiarn5o This could be signaling the return of the reaper, and possible Ghoul Trooper and Ghoul Ranger (male Calamity)? 
The text reads:
Tombstones quake, 
Keep your finger steady. 
The circle will close, 
Better be ready.
https://imgur.com/a/QwhnZ4o
Tombstones, maybe referring to Haunted Hills, or just tombstones? The circle will close, referring to the storm eye shrinking. Keeping your finger steady deals with playing the game and keeping your finger steady. Better be ready is just saying be ready. Fortnite has pinned this twitter post on their twitter, not the newest one with the revolver. This suggests that the portal thing will most likely be the biggest thing coming tomorrow. Someone on twitter found out two of the photos matched, and it was like a puzzle. https://imgur.com/a/qQFHRYf
The last tweet by Fortnite contains the words:
Take the shot, 
If you have enough to last. 
The wind calls out, 
“Fill your chambers, fast.” 
https://imgur.com/a/a6ybAEh
""take the shot, if you have enough to last"" This is referring to a gun with little to no ammo, and the WIND calling people to reload their guns. The image is of a revolver, maybe a One in the Chamber LTM or a return of the revolver, but buffed. To the left of the revolver, we see a light blue color, the same color as rifts. It looks like it is coming from the revolver. This blue light could mean a lot, or nothing at all. The picture doesn't fit into the puzzle. It looks like it is on the belt of the zombie Calamity. 

This is all I have for now. Feel free to tell me info I missed in the comments and I might add it to this post. Please tell me your own theories!

I don't mean to sound really butthurt, but I feel as though Epic might actually make unlockable Omega lights return due to it being a hot topic lately (I have no idea why...). I am personally really against this idea as I spent a lot of time tryna get them.

I personally DO NOT agree with people calling virtual items OG, and Omega lights are not an exception, but I did put a LOT of time into grinding for those lights, and the fact that people who bothered to get them will ultimately kill the game for me: (Omega is one of my favourite skins: it materializes all of those hours of grind I spent on the game). Epic have made Season 5+ styles unlockable after the season ends so why go back and change it?

In short: the terms were simple when Omega first came out: Lvl 80 BY THE END OF THE SEASON for the lights or you miss out, no buts or ifs. I would feel absolutely robbed of my time if this were to happen.

I simply do not care about cosmetics in a game unless they show experience/skill, and max Omega defo shows a lot of hours. Being an MMORPG player I know what grind is like, and I have the mindset of seeing something, wanting it, then working for it.

P.S. I expect you guys to say I have no life: yeah I didn't while I was grinding for those lights...

Instead, how about Epic brings back the option to grind for Omega's unlocks and give a special color for the people that unlocked it entirely during Season 4? So that, those people can still show off their commendable achievement of grinding out the skin during season 4? Kinda like what they did with the Skull Trooper.   


I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this, Omega without the last tier unlock feels painful to me. It's by far one of the most sickest looking skins added to the game and I would love it if I could unlock it.",FortNiteBR

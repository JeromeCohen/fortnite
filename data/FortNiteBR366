I don't see a problem with that, that's a good thing, I think. Everyone was a bad player someday, and we all had to learn to how to play. I know I would've appreciated the help, that's for sure.  

I really don't have a problem with that. The problem is when they start to punish good players.    

Let's say you get in a close quarters fight with a player, you hit him with a pump shotgun blast, then he hits you with a pump shotgun blast too, and before you take the second shot you are dead because the guy changed to his second shotgun and killed you. Do you think that's unfair and needs to change?   

I don't think so. If a player is willing to give one of his slots for a second shotgun, istead of a sniper rifle, an rpg, explosive, shield or healing item, he deserves advantage in a close quarters fight.   

Why changing how the game works? It just feels clunky now. I have a few hours and dollars spent in this game and all I used to do was see a guy...push him with double ramps, pumple + tac his ass.   

Now I'm going to change my playstyle because whiny Billie douldn't defend himself when players bouble shotgunned his ass.   

EPIC, please, take the equipe time out, it just makes the game slower and not so fluid.",FortNiteBR

Switching to the shotgun and sniper feels like such a handicap, the port a fort is a ridiculous concept and the five games I’ve played so far this morning have been PAF after PAF.

I enjoyed playing this game because of its fast-paced style and clear skill gap between players. All of these mechanics and items being put into the game are so unneeded. Y’all can agree to disagree with me and have your own opinion but the constant forcing of updates and new content is too accelerated and the meta is shifting every single week.

To begin, we must acknowledge that the gliders are based off of the Space Shuttles from the Space Shuttle program. On the Space Shuttles from Space Shuttle program, the front of the Space Shuttle orbiters had windows, yet on the new gliders there is not. I understand it would not make much sense for a hand glider to have windows, however on the gliders there is clearly a rectangle indent that was most likely a window but the developers changed the texture of the rectangle indent from a window to the metal texture that surrounds it. This is a careless change made by the developers. This is all ignoring the fact that the gliders don't have forward reaction control thrusters, used to orient the orbiter for re-entry into the atmosphere. I am of course acknowledging the fact that the swept wings are supposed to be angled at 81 degrees on the leading edges yet they seem to be way off. The swept wings outer leading edges should have a 45 degree angle yet they seem to be at a nearly 180 degree angle. This would hugely impact the way this orbiter would move. I think the developers need to change the gliders to be more realistic and a better take on the space shuttles.",FortNiteBR

You know what this means??  It means you have to actually be good to score your kills.   

Have you seen the top players? They take their time to aim and hit directly. They won’t be hurt by this patch.  

Noobs will find it an easier playing field because they can have a little grace period to react to players rather than being shotgun spammed out of the game.  

Sure they will still be smashed by top players but that’s always going to be expected. 

The only people this hurts or those who found it easy money for easy kills.  Now you have to actually work.  No more speed building to double shot gun someone from above with no risk.

The biggest issue I think all of the community (including me) has right now is that it feels insanely clunky and slow to actually try to push someone and punish their mistakes, because the windows for exploiting them has been severly diminished. The call to nerf shotgun swapping was a right one. But I think it was executed poorly.

The solution I propose is to implement the swap delay only when you're switching between weapons of the same type. So if you switch from rifle to pump, there is no delay. But if you switch from pump to tac or heavy, that's where the delay hits. Same goes for snipers.

No matter what items are released in the game the only real way to test balance and meta is by allowing the very best to play together. You get to see just how mandatory an item is by how much it is used in pro play. Just like in any moba if there is a character that is too OP will always be played in the game. This was mercy in OW for a while. 

I think that if epic was to monitor item usages in pro play we can get a much clearer view of what is unbalanced and what isn’t. 

Also let me take you back to the halo days where I ranked games and ranked games where tailored to their specific purposes. 

One was to have fun 

The other was to be competitive in a serious environment.

MLG game mode in halo 3 took away certain things, the biggest one being your radar.

If epic cares about fortnite a future they need to start thinking about the game in two separate ways imo.

Casual mode where they can add whatever the fuck the want to the game 

And ranked mode where they may need to be a lot more sparing when adding rando shot like auto build items and rocket launchers to keep the game balanced so That people’s skill will determine wins rather than rng.

Now there is always going to be rng in a game where there are random drops but the idea is to keep that to a minimum. The more rng in a competitive environment the less satisfying the game will become to the competitive scene and the only real way to test this is to put pros in the same environment and see what items are absolutely mandatory for them to succeed.  Maybe guided rockets are already there. I personally do not think so but eventually something will be and there needs to be a way to keep it on the radar. 

The reason why it isn’t as effective to test these things without a ranking system is because a weapon that seems powerful to a low skilled person may only seem that way because of their lack of skill and so the perception of the item is viewed in a construed way just like Genji and symetra(oberwatch)are viewed as ridiculously overpowered by low skill players only because they haven’t learned to play against them correctly yet. Symetra is rarely seen in competitve play in the higher tiers of play. 

I hope epic takes a look at this and starts making plans for this aspect of fortnites future because it needs it. This game could possibly continue to shine for years and years to come and care needs to be taken for balance of items.

These are my two cents. ",FortNiteBR

I do not think Epic would reintroduce the double pump if they didn’t think the equip time was a healthier change. Everybody knows that abusing the previous system by using a pump and quickly switching to another weapon like a tac or an smg was broken. And took a lot of the skill out of close quarters fights and having to out build your opponent. 

Particularly backed by the new building schemes on console, this change may feel clunky at first but in time is going to be much more healthy to the balance of the game. Particularly that in shotguns which everybody knows is the most overused weapon by far. 

All this new system means is you have to be more careful about taking the first shot, and it punishes the pump even more for missing (which it should do.) This is a good thing for the game balance. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite v3.4 or v3.3 were one of the mixed versions of fortnite: (It had fixed alot of stuff, but had started the phase where Epic will help noobs)

Pros:

* Shotguns were actually fairly balanced, you didn't have double pump, but you had pump tac, which was fairly balance, we also had double Heavy Shotgun which was fair since you would probably only get it late game considering how rare the item 

* The game feels smooth and not choppy, they had fixed alot of the bugs with shotguns that had your shotgun jammed for 2.3 seconds.

Cons:

* The guided missile... This encouraged the ""Camp in a Tower"" strat even more when you can just camp in late game and shoot missiles out of your base and kill everyone without even looking at them

* Vending Machines... Now vending machines are a great idea, but it encourages the players that land at the other side of the map, it helps them by them just harvasting materials and getting Loot for end game.

Now in v3.5, it just makes everything so much worse, the new grenade makes it that you can just plop a instant base whenever, wherever you want, my first game of v3.5 was a guy that got the grenade and just made a base in the middle of Greasy and killed everyone just by ghost peeking.

Please Epic... Revert some of your ways because it's hurting how smooth the game used to be, the shotguns now just feel slow and sluggish, end game is just people camping in towers and shooting rockets, and now camping in towers is more beneficial when you can just make a base in a second.

The reason I, and undoubtedly many other players chose this game over things like PUBG and H1 is because of the pace. When you get in a fight on here its often a matter of who is the better builder (who is the better player), and who can get the best shots off. You used to be able to quickly peak corners or do nice rocket shotgun combos but now thats all gone with this stupid update. This game honestly feels like shit right now.

  Epic games needs to swallow their pride and stop doing these weekly or even the planned ""bi weekly"", updates. The game has gotten worse over the last month.

In addition to this, when harvesting mats, if someone pushes you you're screwed because they've already got their pump out and that few moment window leaves you screwed.

Recently, the developers have added a string of new and rushed features to the game, the guided missile, the port-a-fort, the slowing down of weapon switching, etc...

Each one of these features further confuses me to the point I’m wondering where the developers want to lead this game.

It seems that they are catering to lower-skilled players and campers, which I guess is understandable due to the huge influxes of new members joining the game.

The guided missile has clearly changed the late game considerably. For me, I have experienced going 1v1 in the final 3 or so, against campers sitting at the edge of the circle attempting to chase me down with a guided missile. 

The weapon simply encourages you to sit in a corner and unleash a missile every 10 seconds attempting to kill unsuspecting players 500 meters away from you.

The port a fort simply speaks for itself. 
I have no idea why this weapon was introduced, and I can’t comprehend why anybody would want this in the game.
I know it is easily countered, but I’m still confused about why this is necessary to be in the game.

The weapon switching bugs me the most.

It changes the “feel” of the game, making it seem slower and more sluggish than the crisp, fast feeling I’m used to receiving when playing the game, if you know what I mean.  

Yes, Epic is famous for listening to its customers and player-base, and I’m infinitely appreciative of that. 

However, in present times multiple changes have also been added on top of these amazing updates, which are both unnecessary and negative to the game’s performance. 

Please, Epic, think more about the changes you are making to the game. I know it’s Early Access, but I’m just stating this for the future.

Thank you so much for making this game, I think it’s brilliant and has taken the world by storm.

What do you guys think about this update?

I think it takes the speed of the game. Of course you can still build fast, but now you will have a huge (like immense huge) disadvantage if you are trying to push (even in general) an enemy out of his building. Adding a short equip time to many weapons takes the speed and  momentum out of the game and will result in less fun, because players are not getting rewarded for making an aggressive play. Therefore player will get rewarded if they sit in their building (just like in PUBG) and wait for someone to be stupid enough to push them.

This was my opinion on this Topic. What do you guys think?
Maybe i have overseen something, if so i would like you to share your opinion on this one.

I will start off slow and soft with 3 push ups every loss that I will accumulate up towards 6/9 before I do them. As the weeks go on I will start putting out more and more push ups depending on my body haha.

Every donation of 1€ gives 2 push ups (or other exercise of your choice), so 10€ would have me doing 20 push ups straight away. In other words, I will be crying and sweating on camera.

Outside of the camera I will also be eating better, I have quit sugar and I will be on a low calorie diet for as long as I can.

Do you have any tips or tricks on how to make this challenge even better? Feel free to come in to my chat and talk me up :D!

(But Not For The Reason You'd Assume),"Let me start off by saying that I completely disagree with the idea that Epic Games should add vehicles for faster transportation. I feel that it would ruin the game. There are already some ways that allow people to move faster. May that be rocket riding, or Impulse grenades. I've recently seen a concept for a circular train track that runs around the map and fell in love with the idea. I'd like to add into the discussion and explain how I would like to see this implemented.

 The train would NOT be used as faster trasport but more as a fun thing to mess around with. The train would move very slow. Maybe just slightly faster than walking speed. I would contain chest within the compartments. 
I'd assume they'd want to go with open Cargo cars since that'd make some more sense that having passenger cars. Maybe they could go with both Idk.
 At the beginning of each game the train would spawn on a random part of the track and i'd be up to the players to spot it while falling and get to it first before any other players. With the train containing chest in its compartments, it'd work as a moving location/point of intrest which would really change up the game and make things intresting and fun. 
Some ways people could have fun with this is having your squad stand on top of the train and shoot at other player teams. Those other teams may want to attack them to gain control of the train. (This is just for amusment.)
Imagine landing beside the railway and looting a house just to walk out and spot the train passing by. 

People will not be able to permantly camp on the train since early on the storm will start to come in. The train will go into the storm and then come back out where ever the track takes it. Near the end game the track will mostly be engulfed. This makes everything very balanced and means that the train won't have much effect on the actual end game. 
The train won't really be much of a big deal since probabaly one one team would be on it at once at a time. Normal gameplay would continue on except having the knowledge that theres a train somewhere on the map moving extremely slow but slightly faster than a running pace. Just make sure to watch your back while traveling through train tunnels or walking along the track.

I apologize if this seems like a very stupid Idea, I know there are many ways it could be implemented wrongly, but im suggesting a good way that it wouldn't change gameplay too much. 
But EpicGames have already been changing the game up like crazy so why not?",FortNiteBR

• “Stop ignoring us important topics and only acknowledging memes” (Epic isn’t ignoring us, they listen and take action, they don’t chat about it. This isn’t Bungie and Destiny). 
 
The list goes on and on. Epic has come through on almost every topic and delivered well with every request/issue. Things might not be overnight because they need to be tested and reviewed etc, but they will come. 

This game is MASSIVE and the whole world is playing it. No company in their right mind would not want to support this IP. Yeah you could make some comparisons, *cough Bungie cough* but with how long Fortnite was around before it caught the worlds attention, all of Epic’s hard work paid off and they’re gonna 
support this title as much as possible.

I am however useless at it..i do not mind admitting that i am trash as the game.  I am just not fast enough and can not build for crap!.

As a result of which i have never won a game, nor do i look like winnng a game anytime soon.  Again its not really a big deal as the game is so much fun.

However i would love to see at the begining of the game an option where you could maybe join a game where your playing against other people in a similar position to youself.  I know this has been talked about before anf people hate it but i dont see why.

You could have 3 options,

1) Game v other players (with less than 5 wins)
2) Game v other players (with 5-10 wins)
3) Normal...(like we have now so totally random)

I know people will say just gt better at the game but for some of us we just cant..some people are better at certin games than others but it would be nice to have a few games where i am not dead within the first 2 minutes :-)

Like i said its not a criticism of the game, not at all.

These skins aren’t exclusive, the only thing you have to do to obtain them is swipe a card. How exciting is that? Does it show skill? No! Does it mean you accomplished something in the game? No! Why are you people complaining when skins come back to the shop? It’s actually a very good thing, since knowing Epic isn’t locking them behind some artificial scarcity wall could lead to a reasonable price cut. In a perfect world, all skins should be available and this weekly/daily shop nonsense needs to die. The only item that is exclusive is this entire game are the two umbrellas you get from winning a single game. Just use the skin you find the most visually appealing and not the one you think is the most exclusive, because none of them are.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: Skins aren’t exclusive because almost everyone has $20 of expendable income.

&amp;nbsp;

Rant about Cosmetic prices:  

I think cosmetics in this game are grossly overpriced, leaving me to stick strictly to the battle-pass. $20 a skin? $8 for an emote? $15 for a glider? $12 for an axe? No thanks Epic. The argument that this game is free is complete nonsense because if this game was a full price AAA $60 release, you can bet your ass that you would be able to earn more then 3 skins via a progression system. $60 in this game gets you 1 complete set or 3 unique skins. These prices are getting people because Epic is making it seem like these skins are exclusively locked into a certain time period, they have demonstrated this artificial scarcity is a lie. Please consider not supporting this grossly overpriced, artificial scarcity driven economy. It’s the only way to get fair prices. I would buy cosmetics if they were reasonable, I would buy them all. 

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Exclusive might not of been a clear enough word, maybe I should have used “Value” instead. Meaning nothing in this game has value since everyone can simply buy them.

Double Pump. Or Pump + Tac what it's called right now, but it still offers the same mechanic, just without the constant one hit potential.

On 04.08.18 my Duo's mate and I became a part of the problem as we sold our soul and finally accepted that in the current state of the game you just have to use Pump + Tac to keep up with all the other Pump + Tac users. 

We usually have a winrate of around 30%+, so we did well without it, but with it? Boi... Three duo matches, two wins and one match that my mate almost won on his own by erasing five duo squads like it was nothing with this op combo... 

The next day I became a part of the even bigger problem of Fortnite. Tilted Towers. I never landed there before, I never wanted to be a Tilted Towel but after the whole Season 3 in which we struggled to get many 20+ kills games, because we refused to land in Shotgun City, I wanted to see the misery with my own eyes.

And I did. God was it a mess in that town. Only shotgun sounds in the area, some people killing themselves with rocket launchers and barely anyone building. I landed there for the first time and I left the town with 6 kills - all shotgun kills - and won the game with 11. That's still not a super high kill game but in most other games I don't even have the possibility to see 11 people. 

Tilted has killed early and midgame and Pump + Tac (or double pump before the nerf) has evolved Fortnite to closed quarters combat only, rather than a game with a variety of 10+ different weapons... 

And on 04.08.18 we sold our soul. We became a part of the problem. We became double shotgunners and Tilted Towels and it didn't even feel good, not even winning. I hope Tilted gets destroyed and I hope Pump + [anything] will be altered, because I don't want to be forced to use it and land there.

How do you get kills like that? The game was fine how it was and I just want Epic to consider this comment. I won’t stop playing this game and you guys are doing an AMAZING job with it.

For example, are Battle Pass skins considered exclusive and never to be seen again? Or will they, at some point, be sold at the shop? Are holiday skins exclusive to that holiday and this is just an exception because of the popularity of the back bling, or are all holiday skins going to be sold again at some random point and the only reason we haven't seen, say, Storm Trooper is because they want that one to be kind of an OG skin?

**Edit:** I think it's necessary to say that the point of the post isn't to bitch about holiday skins coming back. It's just that people need to know so they can make informed decisions.

Don't shower us in loot (that is obviously a scheme to fill your pockets) then keep all the damn money and not fix the game. The reason people pay $20 for a freaking skin is because they want to SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER. And what do you do? Nothing. Zip, zero, zilch. Then you throw new **** at us masking the original problem and this cycle will obviously continue as long as this scheme can last or until the inevitable downfall of Fortnite.

There should be a way to get vBucks for free especially since you need to pay so much money for a few skins. This is where my idea comes in. You should be able to earn vBucks after winning games. After you win a game you should be presented with the screen you get for earning battle pass rewards and for the reward there should be vBucks. For the amounts I thought there should be 25 vBucks for a squad win, 50 for a duo, and 100 for a solo.

I have always played multiplayer games. From tabletop Warhammer, DOTA, CS1.6, WOW, League, and everything in between. I’ve played casually and hardcore. I sincerely hope that I’m 100% wrong about everything I’m about to say.

I don’t think that you’re going to run out of steam because content is limitless, but I think you’re on track to bloat the game with non-essential features. Fortnite was a tornado of great things happening at once and Epic has handled the increase in popularity far better than any other company I’ve seen. I’m not saying its luck, because Epic is a great company but IMO, this is the first time in Twitch.tv history a multi-platform game has dominated the number 1 spot and remained there. Why? Well I think for a few choice reasons: Fortnite isn’t like PUBG in that you need something special to play it which I think deterred a lot of fans of PUBG. It had new mechanics that added and entirely different dynamic to the game, building was new and made the game not as linear as competitors and it came with entertaining streamers that helped its growth. Tack on the Amazon Prime deal and that’s a wrap. Great gaming companies have tempo. They keep it consistent. I think that's important. I could be wrong, but I'm just speaking on a forum about what I've seen / experienced.

Epic, the game is still young. There’s still large portions of the map no one visits; waiting to be turned into the new Tilted Towers. There’s so many QOL features to add, in fact, I just saw one on the front page about colour distinction on friendly and anti-friendly traps, that’s a great idea. Competitive modes, itemization and customization of avatars, banners, mechanic-polishing, there’s SO much left to be done. Keep making creative content like skins and such because its great…but shit…we JUST figured out bloom and aiming…and we already have vending machines, guided rockets, and now something that builds for you.

I feel like you’re trying to put toppings on a pizza but there isn’t even dough yet…it’s just flour in a bag. 

I love this game. I just don’t want to see people quit because they are dying to guided rockets, because building editing is still buggy.

TL;DR: Content pacing and tempo is really important to the longevity of a game and there's of basic stuff that needs to be done.",FortNiteBR

But in squads it's broken, when you need to build a 1x1 every single time it gets fired, and have to deal with his teammates shooting at you at the same time, it's broken. There is basically nothing you can do against it. 

Now, you're making an item that builds a 3 high tower in 1 second!? I mean, come on. You're making it insanely easy for bad players to gain high ground over someone, literally building their cover for them instead of them learning how to build and get good at them game.

Traps really don’t reward any sort of skill, any kill you get with a trap box you would’ve gotten regardless, and any kill you get with a trap you randomly place in a house is just based on luck. 

It can be really hard to see traps, and they take a while to destroy, which also gives away your position cause usually you have to shoot them not axe them. 

Traps are one of the only things I really feel are bad about this game. It’s like the Red Zone in PUBG. It’s basically complete randomness if you get hit by them and is in no way really competitive. 

They also take spawns from other guns and things like jump pads. I have ended matches with 10-20 traps that I’ll never have a use for.

353,EversorA,1523393218,8bb8du,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8bb8du/unpopular_opinion_id_actually_love_to_have_a/,6,Unpopular opinion: I'd actually LOVE to have a second SBMM queu.e,"**(TL;DR at bottom)** I just feel like the game itself is currently becoming more and more casual and the skill cap is decreasing. (As you can see most of the people saying right now). My solution: SBMM. Yes, I've seen how many people are against it. But hear me out, I still think that a SEPERATE, SECOND queue would be a great addition. I would love to play Fortnite more competitively, but with random MM, you won't be able to do that. I want to prove myself against other good players, I want to have way more building fights! But in most of my games, I encounter mostly bad players, which feels like it makes it wayy too easy (yes, I know that sounds selfish, but that's just how I feel like. It feels like being Master in Overwatch and playing against a Bronze, that has no chance in winning anyways). 

&amp;nbsp;

I've read many threads about arguments for and against SBMM, many of them don't even include arguments against it. Instead they just say ""Epic pls don't do it"" basically. But I'll list most of which I could think of and read here now:

&amp;nbsp;

- ""The queue times will be too long, it'll take ages until you find a game""

&amp;nbsp;

You find games insanely fast right now. If 50% of the players are playing competetive now, that would only half the queuetime, which would still be pretty fast.

&amp;nbsp;

- ""A lot of responses to the people being negative about SBMM is telling them there should just be a casual mode then. But once you add a ranked and casual mode, casual mode is no longer the fortnite we have now. It would become the non serious, stupid jerk mode instead of the fortnite flavor everyone gets served together which is unique and memorable.""

- ""Kinda happened with Overwatch, once ranked dropped its hard to get a real team comp in quickplay""

&amp;nbsp;

And I totally disagree. How exactly would it become the ""non serious, stupid jerk mode""? You can't compare it to Overwatch at all, because they are entirely different games. Here you have one character you can play and just because a different queue has been added, doesn't mean people suddenly play the game to not win.

&amp;nbsp;

- ""Please, no ranking. The fact that there's three players left and the other two are probably MUCH better than you is EXACTLY what makes this game so fun! As soon as you add ranks, you add tryhards, salt, blame, and it sucks ALL the fun out of the game! Peace.""

&amp;nbsp;

Thats exactly why they should make it a seperate queue. Problem solved.

&amp;nbsp;

""Careful though - a ranked “competitive” mode could essentially make the standard BR expwrience seems like irrelevamt. A bit like how in overwatch a win in quick play is irrelevant because of competitive.""

""The thing is most people who actively play video games are obsessed with ranks and stats, them being the only way to truly prove how good you are and offering bragging rights.""

&amp;nbsp;

And that's just how it is. People will always complain about something. Just look at the comments of any thread, and scroll down a bit. On the Overwatch subreddit, there are still quickplay clips that get thousands of upvotes. I don't really think people will totally go against casual mode, there are always different opinions.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, as a reminder: 3 months ago, there were a total of 30 million Fortnite players. I don't think that the opinions here represent the opinion of the whole community. Thinking that is just stupid. Even if here were 500k active users, that'd still only be the opinion of 1,6% of the whole community.

&amp;nbsp;

#EDIT: And please, instead of just downvoting. TELL ME YOUR OPINION! I want to know why you disagree with me, let us have a conversation about it! Thanks for reading.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Think about it. Would SBMM really destroy the game, or rather, even save it? The game gets easier and easier currently, skillcaps are decreasing. I think it'd be a great addition.",FortNiteBR

PLEASE don't add that insta tower nade. 

With only so few slots theres far too many items.

Early game snioers are great but in the last 5 i find it has too much range to be viable.

Shotties are great all through and must have.

AR again are staple i feel. Theres never an end game without shotty and AR.

Rockets are a must in the end game too but great throughout 

Healing and or shield item (s) i find often most people have too.

Pulse nades are great for team rez push and escape.

Having 2 of most of these is great too because it means you can keep pressure on longer and stay in the fight before having to run and reload.

These tower items are gunna take a slot that really needs to be something else and will just stop people learning to build. If i go up against someone with one theyll throw it and have a tower while im still building my shitty little hovel. So i then have to make sure i have one so that if i end up against someone with one. I can bridge the gap.

Epic, ypur filling the game with too many items either give us another slot or two or take a few items (revolverevolverevolver) out. (But id much rather this item not he added)",FortNiteBR

This idea here has a lot of potential. The winner could,  a reward, for example a skin of rare quality. 

or of different skin tiers, let's say that there's different tiers of events, for example a 20 V-Buck event, that rewards you with a green/uncommon skin for your character or whatever, 50 - V-Buck event where you get rewarded a blue/rare skin if you're the last man standing, 100 V-Buck event = purple/epic skin rarity, 150 - 200 V-Bucks event = Legendary skin rarity, if you win ofc. Only the winner gets a reward. Epic will make a ton of money and the gamers will have fun competing for them cheap skins and also increasing their skills. You could also have ""lesser"" skins, such as gliders, pickaxes, and other in game cosmetic item skins, that have an entry fee that is fair, to the skin that the winner is about to receive. Hope this sounds cool and that Epic Games would consider implementing this. I think it would be a cool thing, and epic as a company sure will make a ton of money, for all those people out there not willing to pay 2000 V-Bucks for a legendary but will try several times to win a BR event for a 200 V-Buck entry fee!

* Fixed the 'editing glitch' where if you edited too quickly you were unable to edit squares or even access the edit menu at all 

* Fixed heavy lag spikes on console(s) that caused many players to fall to their deaths because on client side they were on a floor but on server side they had walked straight off to their doom

Things that Epic Games have done such as removing game breaking things like the double pump, wall glitching, and not being able to take your weapon out in the beginning of the game have been great extensions onto an already great game.

I started before season 2 and got to rank around 60 and when season 2 started, I went bat sh*t crazy on purchases.  Emotes.  Characters and everything vBucks could buy.  Well over 4 rows of characters.  

Recently got invited to the beta on iPhone and for some odd reason, it would not let me link my XBL.  So instructions I found said to finish creating  a new account to then unlink --- then to link with my epic account.  

I did so and everything was fine and dandy until I logged in the next day and saw everything was reset and deleted.  Level 1 (then 3 for the one game I played on PC and one on the iPhone).   

I wrote to epic using their contact us page and it is now going on 2 weeks.  

What should I do?  I really just want all my items back and season pass restored.  But being that the season is about to end, I need help because I want those items within the pass rewards.  

I was a few levels after getting best mates and was close to the dark voyager.

I hope I’m not beating a dead horse by complaining, but after seeing what the Port-a-Fort does I’m worried that Epic is taking the game in the wrong direction, and for the wrong reasons.

We all know the issues with the game (gun glitches, lag) but I don’t see many people addressing how Epic is molding the game into one everyone can win. The game already has insane mass appeal, so I would guess these hand holding changes are to keep the young player, the new player, and the unskilled player in the game so that they keep their player base up.

It seems that these changes are having an opposite effect.

It is not like people are leaving the game in droves, but I see more and more veteran players complain about the game breaking bugs only to be met with game bloating items. 

No one needs the vending machines. Guided missiles are removing the only skill barriers on an otherwise OP weapon. Now Port a Fort is literally completing a skill based task for players, requiring no skill of them at all.

It’s making the game more accessible, sure, but I feel like if Epic keeps adding changes like this it will start to turn away those that have loved BR since launch. Here’s to hoping that doesn’t happen. ",FortNiteBR

There's simply no way for traditional console players who use a controller/gamepad to compete on equal ground with console or PC-based players with mouse and keyboard. This is a deal-breaker for me since all my friends are on console and my preferred way of gaming is on a couch with a controller. Even if Epic adds the ability for people to remap controller buttons (a much needed feature), this still won't give controller players a competitive advantage against mouse and keyboard players.

With astronomical numbers like 3.4 million concurrent players, it would really be nice to join a lobby with just controller/gamepad players and actually be able to enjoy the game on an equal footing with other players. Otherwise, traditional console players will have to settle for being cannon fodder for everyone else, or go find other another game to play.

The guided rocket update was not bad but not good either, we got a rocket that can be spammed on squads or even duos while being hidden. This takes out the aggresive playstyle, just hide in a base shooting rockets while your team shoots the enemy team at the same time and you will probably win 4 out of 5 times. The moment you hear the guided rocket you have to adapt and try to kill the enemy team avoiding guided rockets and getting shot by other 2-3 people.
On to the next addition... vending machines, now you can just find one and get items for just materials. There goes the ""find guns or kill enemy players to claim that delicious weapon"". And if you are lucky enough you get the best wep in the game for the easiest farming material. Most of the time the vending machine got shitty items but if you find one good one, god save us all. 
And now, the grenade that auto builds an entire base instantly? Like come on you are making this game waaaay to easy for people that is starting to play the game, they will never get better if they can get things this easily... no weapon? Good i found a vending machine. Sorry i can't build? Nice i got a grenade that does that for me.
This game is becoming casual friendly and i know ""give everyone a chance to fight"" but i think it is better just to let people learn the ""hard way"" all of us did. They will never try to build or get better building if they can just get a grenade and call it a day. The only thing that is left is that we get a shotgun before landing lol.

However, I'm not here to discuss such topics (though I have my opinions on them all). I feel like all this negativity is self perpetuated. I understand what the root motive of all these posts are, but it's beginning to get out of hand. 

A very cynical attitude is being adopted and I'd be sad to see such a fun community built around a whimsical, fun-hearted game, go downhill like this. I'm not trying to be some arbiter for /r/FortNiteBR, I'm just another player that sees this downhill slope that the community is on, trying to throw my 2 cents in.

I'm not trying to eliminate negativity from the subreddit, in fact, there is such a thing as constructive criticism. My post even carries a somewhat negative/constructive message with it. What I hate to see is a hostile and tribal attitude that's developing among players. It's Us vs Epic or it's the Hardcore Players vs the Casuals.

In the Season 2 pass, the last skin you unlock is the Black Knight

I went to google and thought what would come up if I typed in *Black Knight Space* and this Wikipedia article popped up: [Black Knight satellite conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_satellite_conspiracy_theory) 

The introductory line in the Wikipedia article says as so: *1998 NASA photo of space debris,[1] an object believed by some conspiracy theorists to be an extraterrestrial satellite, the ""Black Knight.""
1998 NASA photo of space debris,[1] an object believed by some conspiracy theorists to be an extraterrestrial satellite, the ""Black Knight.""
The Black Knight satellite conspiracy theory claims that there is a spacecraft in near-polar orbit of the Earth that is of extraterrestrial origin and that NASA is engaged in a cover-up regarding its existence and origin. This conspiracy theory combines several unrelated stories into one narrative.*

After reading that we can infer that the satellite could represent the 'meteor.' It also states, **""This conspiracy theory combines several unrelated stories into one narrative.""**

Several unrelated stories into one narrative, hmm. 
This makes sense since Knights and Spacemen/Extraterrestrial Beings. 

What makes this even more believable is the fact that the origin of this conspiracy dates back to when Nikola Tesla heard long delayed echoes which were later translated by Duncan Lunan. You can read more about that here: [Duncan Lunan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Lunan) 

It also mentions a Blue Steak Missile program (I don't know if that correlates with the 'blue streak comet' which is seen on FBR's map

Finally, the skin unlocked at tier 70 in the Battle Pass for season 3 is called 'Dark Voyager.' Who's description is written as such ""From the vast darkness of deep space."" Which could mean he is from the *thing* above the map. ",FortNiteBR

1. the same old loot system: every game goes quite similar, either you die early or make it to late game but i feel as if you always end with the same weapons, a sniper, a scar, a rocket launcher, a healing item and another random piece of shit. when you look at other BR games such as PUBG every game is incredibly unique, the attachment system and many weapons adds a depth that Fortnite doesn't have, not to mention vehicles play a large role as well, it feels as every game can be played out differently but there is never a situation in which you lose simply because of bad RNG.

2. the fan base, this will be brief. the fan base is aids. mainly just because its now popular so 90% of its players are 13-9 year olds who watch ninja and think they're a god.

3. only a single map causing the game to get quite repetitive

4. ahem micro transactions out the ass ahem

5. the combat. pretty much ever battle consists less of pure skill and knowledge as much as it does who has the most materials to build a giant tower and third person peak until the circle close in, thrilling. its a battle royale game, key word, BATTLE, mining trees and rocks then sitting in a tower isn't much of a battle.

now some positives.

1. the building system, i gave it shit but it is an interesting twist its just unfortunate how most players use it.

2. not a very difficult game so it's pretty easy to get the hang of.

Cosmetics. Everyone loves cosmetics. In fact, it's a nice way to reward players and keep them playing. Most of free to play games does exactly that, whether it's in game currency, or lootboxes, as much as I dread them. This keeps people playing more than they otherwise would. When I play pubg (not f2p, but you get it), I know for certain that I can get BP and spend them for lootboxes, and potentially get some sweet stuff out of it. Heroes of the storm showers me with lootboxes who contains sweet things, including legendary skins and even heroes themselves. In fortnite, however, I feel like there's no reward for playing, when I'm out of daily quests and weekly challenges. And at this point, leveling takes forever, even with 110% xp boost I got from battle pass. Yes, I get it, I should be playing because it's fun, and I do so, but getting rewards from PLAYING adds even more fun, and keeps people playing more, in some cases more than they normally would. I love cosmetics. Many people do. I am a complete sucker for cosmetics, and immediately bought battle pass when I started playing without even thinking twice about it, and bought plenty of vbucks after that. 


Now let's talk about how I propose to introduce the vbucks rewards. I'm not saying do all of the things listed, but at least one would be amazing:


1) V-bucks rewarded for PLAYING matches. It could be complete scraps, like from just a few vbucks for playing a match, up to, let's just say for the numbers sake, 50 for scoring victory royale. It could be complete scraps, but it'd feel rewarding.


2)  Add a small number of vbucks as a reward from daily quests, like they do in STW. 50 would do just fine.


3) If not dailies, introduce some daily, or at least weekly challenges specifically for vbucks. 


4) Add some vbucks as a LEVELING reward, instead of just battle pass.



Now how would it benefit Epic, and both STW and BR parts of the games?

1) People would feel rewarded for playing, in turn playing more.


2) It would solve the leech and afk farmer problem in Save The World, or at least drastically reduce it.


3) People who would normally never buy vbucks, or are too poor to do so, might actually do it with these rewards in mind. Hear me out - they'd play shit ton of games, hoarding, let's say, 1000 vbucks. Then suddenly a 2000 vbuck skin gets released, and they REALLY love it. Now tell me, what is more likely scenario for a person who normally would never want to buy vbucks to actually BUY vbucks to get that skin? a) He has hoarded 1000 vbucks by playing the game with my suggestions, and thought ""hey, I only need to spend 10 bucks for that skin, I might actually do it this time"", or b) The way things are currently, the person will barely have any vbucks, and see that he needs to pay ~25 dollars for that skin.


4) People would get hooked more because of the rewards, and in turn want more skins, so they will be more likely to actually spend money on vbucks, benefiting epic games.

That's what I think. A rewarded player is a satisfied player. And a satisfied player is more likely to also be a good customer. In the long run, everyone would win. It's like a free sample of crack. Get them hooked, and then they will pay. ",FortNiteBR

Many people have predicted that the meteor is going to fall down, and destroy Tilted Towers. I think that this may be true, but I also have another thing that this meteor will cause. Epic has said many times that they were going to make Save the World free so I think that the meteor will carry the aliens that plague Save the World which will mark them finally making Save the World free. Since this would be the alien invasion that starts Save the World this would support the twitter voicemail theory which some think is connected to fortnite because it also points to something happening on April 18th regarding aliens.

Then I see these posts on reddit of someone on PC in a building battle with people saying he is an insane builder,  when I am better than them at building on console. 

Change my mind. 






EDIT: What I mean is on average people on console are much better at building, but the top tier PC players are a lot better than the top tier console players because of the easier controls. ",FortNiteBR

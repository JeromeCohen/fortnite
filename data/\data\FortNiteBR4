Hello everyone, we have recently been revisiting our promotional guidelines and rules in regards to posts based around nostalgia.  We have had many internal discussions about this, and have been monitoring community feedback. 

We have settled on the following rule changes:

##Promotional Guidelines

&gt;-Users may post any watermarks.  However we do not allow advertising of other subreddits, websites, apps, or self-hosted projects.

This should make it much easier for users to watermark their projects.  The rule used to read that you would need a 10:1 ratio with comments outside of your own posts.  However feedback has shown this rule was very hard to understand for our users.  As such it has changed to allow any watermark that isn't explicitly prohibited.

##Posts Based Around Nostalgia 

&gt;-If your post is based around nostalgia, you may only post on Throwback Thursdays (EST). If you post on any other day, your post will be removed.

This one is pretty straight forward.  Nostalgia posts used to be prohibited entirely, then we started allowing them again.  We saw many users voice their desire for and against nostalgia posts.  We realized we needed some sort of compromise.  We recently ran a poll to see how the community felt, and it ended up 60/40 in favor of keeping nostalgia.  This has led us to allow nostalgia posts, but only on Thursdays.  The first ""Throwback Thursday"" starts tomorrow at 12am EST. 

We believe this will help reduce posts deemed to be ""karma farmy"" and also relieve stress from creators who need to watermark projects for multiple platforms.",FortNiteBR

With syphon game was balanced IMHO, because all the mobility we have in this game and the permanent push of enemies during the game was balanced by health for kill.
Now, at this moment third party is unsustainable IMHO... Slipstream and all the vehicles turn every fight in a continuous push, without a time to breath; I keep dying with a decent amount of kill because I can't stand the third or fourth team that come at me after two fights and no time to heal, and every play session is becoming really frustrating...
I know that syphon will never return, and I understand that, but I think epic HAS to think about third partying in this game, and sort out something to limit it.
I think that reduce the mobility in this game would be a good think. Maybe keep the quad and the rifts, but remove slipstream, platforms and some other stuff.
If we reduce mobility, we'll increase the time enemies can join a fight, and guarantee a decent amount of time to heal after a fight.
When epic remove syphon said that game was becoming to much aggressive...now it's aggressive at the same identical way, but without any balance at all...

I stopped playing video games for years because I couldn’t find a game that felt interesting. Then Fortnite came out. It’s simplicity and build mechanics got me hooked. I’ve played Fortnite exclusively for the past year. 

I was a total bot until last season when I finally felt like I was making progress. Then the unvaulting event, pumps being vaulted, OP weapons/items, countless bugs not getting addressed and a less than ideal loot pool pushed me to find new games to play. 

I’ll start off by saying that Fortnite is by far the best game out there. Even in its worse state I still find it more fun than most games. But it is so hard to come back after playing other games with a higher FOV. I always feel like my character model is blocking my view. I also get slight motion sickness for the first 10 minutes while I try to adjust. There is absolutely ZERO reason why a FOV slider shouldn’t be in the game. It is NOT a compromise to lock the FOV.

I just hope that we get a season dedicated to quality of life updates (pre-edit disabled options, FOV slider, etc.) and bug fixes instead of weapon/item additions.",FortNiteBR

EPIC then used this same global damage inorder to counter the votes for the unvaulting event.

With the recent PvE LTM epic got the chance to try several new ideas. Waves and preparation, and most importantly a Final Boss health bar.

From these new mechanics I'm thinking we may have an LTM event where the monster attacks us, we defend several spots before finally defeating the monster in a certain location. Then the monster dies and drops the castle, creating a new POI for next season. 

For example we could have a staged fight at pleasant park, that would destroy/ change pleasant for the next season , then be forced to run up to the block for another fight that would destroy the block, and finally a fight in Loot lake that drops the castle over the vault, and maybe the monster melts into water making it a lake again. 

TL;DR was the LTM a test for scripting a giant fight with the ICE Monster?

Two days in and I’m already demoralised. I’ve picked up the shooting mechanics but I just can’t build very fast. I’ve been trying to get faster by practising but even after a few days I’m still ridiculously slow. 

I’ve played 14 solo matches and have a grand total of 2 kills. Those 2 kills were pure luck rather than skill. Most solo games for me end up with me being shot out of nowhere or if it ends in a gunfight, the opponent has built the Eiffel Tower in the time it takes me just to get a little fort up. 

So, does anyone have any tips to help me improve? I don’t want to be a pro player or anything, I just want to be competent enough not to die so quickly all the time. Any help would be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

For the experienced players and for the new players. The game is too hard for new players because of the growing skill in the general player base. But also, the game has been seeing an influx of items that are often broken and unfair. The reasoning for these items is to give new players an ability to get a kill or advantage. 

There are really simple solutions for this. 

1)Improve the ranked game mode to push better players to play that instead of pub stomping but as well as giving new players a place where they can play with people their own ELO. 

2)Give ranked rewards so better players have a reason to play instead of just siphon. This will push more of the competitive players into a different game mode while giving everyone a reason to play it. 

3)Separate loot pools between pubs and competitive. We all can agree that there are some items that don’t belong in the hands of skilled players but they could be fun for public matches. 

RANK REWARDS, RANK REWARDS, RANK REWARDS

4)Add kill cams 

The game is too big and you can’t keep everyone together. It’s come to a point where if you make it too easy, you spit in the faces of those who spent hours on end practicing everyday. But if you make it so where only they can dominate, you alienate new players. Simple answer is to just give the good players a place where they can play and be rewarded for being good. While also keeping pubs a place where new players can play but also feel challenged. There will be pub stomping regardless but you’ll have less of it when you give good players a place to play and not feel like their time is wasted.",FortNiteBR

They're probably going to be somewhere for 4th of July and the following weekend because its straight in the middle of the summer and of course, is next to the 4th of July. This is why I believe that they should be put off until the week of July 8 so that lots more people will have the opportunity to do them.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fortbyte image, as I'm sure we have all known or speculated about; contains every main event to take place in the storyline of the Fortnite Battle Royale universe. This means that specific characters and events are excluded to a great degree. With that out of the way, let us begin to analyze the image.

&amp;#x200B;

Bunker Jonesy begins the story at the end of Season 3. Tilted Towers is clearly identified thanks to its clocktower, however, Titled is placed directly next to three buildings (*i.e Dusty Depot*) and a meteor. This is to represent how the Comet was believed to be hitting Tilted, but instead hit Dusty Depot. 

After this, B.J (short for ***B****unker* ***J****onesy*) depicts The Visitor's escape vessel after it had opened, leading to a profile depiction of The Visitor, which then leads to the Rocket from the Rocket Event in Season 4 which spawned the rifts. Next to the rift is a drawing of an ATK and the Durr-Burger head.

The only events of Seasons 5 and 6 that are depicted by B.J are the cube and another drawing of the cube lifting the Loot Lake Island.

Directly next to the depictions of our beloved Kevin is a depiction of several X4 Stormwings and the Ice King. This is the only depiction of Season 7.

Below the Ice King is the Volcano which is shown to have three flying triangles causing destruction upon a cityscape, this is the destruction of Tilted Towers; next to the Ice King the Vault is also visible with each of the five obelisks powered. This is from when we entered the Vault.

Lastly, a large monster is shown in the bottom right and left; presumably, this monster is the Cattus creature that came from the core of Polar Peak.  


This leaves only two images in the entire Fortbyte image without explanation which I have labeled as ""Misc"". These images are:

* The Battlebus flying over a small island, this could be meant as B.J's idea of Seasons 1 and 2 where there wasn't much story; alternatively, it could also be a nod to the [Flare Gun Trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/c1gw5g/flare_gun_trailer/) with which the stranded Jonesy shares a striking resemblance.
* What looks like an angrier version of the Cuddle Team Leader head being raised by a crane.
* &amp;#x200B;

All this said, B.J does exclude many characters and points in the story such as the pirates, the Prisoner, the Enforcers, Drift, A.I.M, Sgt. Winter, Calamity, Dark Bomber, and many more.

It should also be noted that symbol depicting a circle with a diagonal dash through it appears repeatedly throughout the entire mural, as well as being included in the Battlepass as a spray titled ""Nope"" at Tier 54. It likely means nothing but it is worth an honorary mention.

Now, onto the story!

-Polar Peaks Purpose

So we have found out that once the ice king landed, he had a certain “agenda” as we’ll call it, and at first it seemed that he was going to take over the island and turn into a winter wasteland for his own evil pleasure. This theory was then pushed even further as he literally formed an ice ball in the sky which turned out to be a sort of alter he used to form a giant manifestation of himself and cast a sort of “curse” on the island, actually turning it into a snowy, devastated wasteland, with his own evil snowy minions (ice fiends) attacking anything that moved (https://youtu.be/j9MUBckmBc4) During this event, us players were certain he had evil intent and nothing more...however, the polar peak was something very, VERY different than just an “evil” kings lair...Because once the ice started to melt on polar peak...it had something rather...unusual inside.

-A Fiery Awakening

Inside of the mysterious layers of ice at polar peak, it turns out the ice king had a “guest” held captive inside. And if you were like me, every match you always felt bad and tried to free him, however, maybe there was a REASON he was chained up in the bowels of polar peak... 

We know that The Ice King was a pretty COLD hearted person (I’m sorry...), but to have somebody (The Prisoner) trapped in a dungeon with chains the size of Texas, well that’s just evil. But did it ever cross our minds as to WHY he was chained up? Events happen soon that will prove why REAL fast, but I don’t want to jump the gun too fast. Let’s a quick step back. 

-The Ice King Isn’t Evil (Mostly...)

So what if polar peak and the chunk around it actually was a COINCIDENCE that they hit our island? Yes there was a cinematic where evil/jacked Santa attacks the island, but that doesn’t really mean they were AIMING for it. Theres is a huge chance that they just happened to smack into our island by chance. Now, that being said, I’d like to offer you an analogy. Say you have an ice cube, and your main goal to keep it cold, and you live at the North Pole. No problem right? Well let’s say in a matter of minutes you end up in the deserts of Mexico, what now? The Ice Kings “ice cube” was the prisoner and he had to act fast or else his “ice cube” would melt (...and cause a volcano and kind of the end of the world...). So that’s why his “plan” was to get a shard of this mysterious power this island held (Kevin) and use its remaining power to change the atmosphere to keep his friend where he belonged. The Ice King didn’t know the cubes real power, and that’s why it turned the Fiends into Ice Fiends, evil ice zombies wasn’t really part of the ice kings plan but, there was millions of others to deal with them, he was much too busy.

-Failure

So back to our current story, the ice kings plan kind of failed in the sense of success. Yes, he made it cold, but not for long. See, Kevin’s power was already drained, but he didn’t know that, so his “curse” was only temporary, and no parts left of Kevin available to him, it was game over. The prisoner escaped since the ice all melted but at least he was weak, buying us more time to enjoy wailing woods before...well...”deforestation”

Once the prisoner got out, he created alters to regain his strength and warm up to his full potential, he unleashed his fury, and changed the island so much, it warranted season 8 and we jumped straight from snow days to beach days.

-The Endgame

We knew as soon as we saw the volcano the prisoner conjured up, that it was bound to erupt sometime or another, the only question was when. But when we saw nothing happened for a while, everybody kind of forgot about it. But then things started to get weird. 

Remember our little government friends from season 4? Well guess what, their back, and digging holes in every god forsaken place they can. These holes seemed pretty pointless until they tore up the EXACT spot of Kevin’s (supposed) final resting place. Underneath of it was an actual VAULT where apparently all the vaulted weapons go. And all of the sudden, a countdown led us players to actually go into the vault, and pull out a gun we all hated yet for some reason wanted back. But anyways, once it came back, everything was all peachy for about....4 seconds

-A Flaming Demise

Picture it, your just playing around, talking about how broken the drum gun is and how your confused as to why everybody chose and then BOOM!!!! You hear an explosion and it looks like today was 2 events for the price of 1. The volcano did the inevitable and erupted, devastating Retail AND Tilted towers AND hit polar peak. This took us all by surprise and made everybody VERY aware that the volcano was no laughing matter. It was only weeks later until we saw it’s TRUE power.

-Jonesy + Peely = No Peely

Season 9 started with jonesy and Peely running for their lives as Mt. saint prisoner unleashes it’s fury on the island, destroying anything in its path (https://youtu.be/q8I4CgsSZgk). We see Jonsey and Peely make it a bunker, and then party hard until they run out of food and eventually lead to cannibalism (its true, look up Peely’s origin) but after that nightmare, we see Jonsey get rescued by some futuristic folk and he sees what they’ve done to place. Tilted is now Neo-Tilted, Retail is now a shopping mall, and there’s these new sky ways put out all over the island. (A worthy side note is tilted is running off of energy being pumped from the vault/Kevin’s grave, so though nothing has happened yet, let’s see where this goes...). And to top it off, we see the volcano has gone kablooy and is now a power plant. So, welcome to the future! Where surely there’s no giant monsters...Right?

-I shall call him “Dave”

So if you were a giant monster the size of a mountain, put in a deep sleep, what’s one thing that would DEFINITELY wake you up? Perhaps a volcanic rock to the noggin? Well, that’s what did our friend in. (nobody has named him yet, so I’m calling him “Dave”). Well it looks like the blast that hit polar peak awoke possibly the cause for season 10. A few weeks into season 9, the cause of the blast at polar peak was staring right at us the whole time...literally. A week or two ago from me writing this, the monster has officially broken out of polar peak now and is wearing it like a back pack while floating in the ocean Godzilla style. Looks like Ol’ Ice King really DID have his hands full down there. I mean, what else could be down there? Leviathan LTM? Who knows.

-The Future Is...Concerning

So with season 9 we got “Fortbytes” which once collected reveal a picture of Jonsey making a cave painting of the EXACT monster (Dave) we saw, the EXACT Fiends we saw, and one other guest...KEVIN. Jonsey’s painting sort of reveals that Kevin is NOT dead! (Good lord, Kevin is a fighter!) however, we can’t really base anything off of this right now as nothing has happened. So unfortunately, I must leave this here.

-Conclusion and TL;DR

The ice king is actually a good guy and was protecting us from 2 bad guys. One caused paradise that turned into the apocalypse and the other is Godzilla.",FortNiteBR

Everyone knows about the whole ""Summer Drift"" debacle at this point, and many owners of the original Drift skin are stating that they should be entitled to the skin for free or have it as a style. The thing is...""SUMMER DRIFT"", is NOT the same as ""DRIFT"". The skins themselves have many differences within their modeling that most wouldn't see, but this isn't about that. The bottom line here is that they aren't the same skin. Epic is not releasing the original ""Drift"" skin from the season five battle pass, they are reusing the CHARACTER but it's still not the same skin at the end of the day.

You all should stop being entitled and realize that more people will get to enjoy our amazing Drift character. He's become a really popular icon for Fortnite and it's a good thing that everyone can use him now.",FortNiteBR

Each person has to score at least 40k
At the very minimum
Either that or 2 people have to score extremely high
YOU CANNOT DIE not even once
If you do there is still a chance but you gonna have to sweat hard to make up for points
Your gonna have to have 3 types of guns to avoid ammo depletion
Switch guns if you have to
I recommend either a combat or tac shotgun and the new AR that uses light ammo
NO EXPLOSIVES 
NEVER USE EXPLOSIVES EVER
they can kill you too easily and take too long to detonate
Instead use stinkbombs
They are way more effective and are instant they killl off the low level brutes easily and are good for streaks and killing large groups to prevent being overwhelmed.

Finally the last thing is grab the bonuses you can get these quickly by using 2 of the 5 unused slots for impulses and gliders

I spent 5 hours grinding because I play on switch and always get garbage teamates in fill but if you've got a squad already or if your lucky and got good teamates or if your just a god and can do most of the scoring yourself and never loose a single streak then all the rest it just tactics

ALWAYS thirst the final boss untill he's low then deal with the zombies stink bombs and turrets are perfect for this.

Good luck",FortNiteBR

I believe that the beach bomber should be a selectable style for the brite bomber, simply because I feel that the brite bomber skin owners have been “conned” on multiple occasions.

1st. The brite bomber was out months before back blings became a thing and once the brite bag was leaked most people thought that you would get it with owning brite bomber (1200 v-bucks) however epic released the brite gunner a 1500 v-buck skin with the brite bag.

2nd. The dark bomber was a 1200 v-buck skin, it is arguable more detailed and comes with the dark bag back bling but for the same price as brite bomber.

1. TOO much prize money in tournaments! Everyone wants a piece of that 100 million prize pool and all the little kids dream of becoming a millionaire playing video games. Solution: Reduce the prize pool in the future. Make it 20 mil or something like all the other esports titles.
2. SPAM SPAM SPAM building. Please for the love of god, add a cooldown to turbo building. You shouldn't be able to just hold right click and spam build. 
3. STOP the smurfs in arena. Please I am at 200 points and whenever I queue up in arena, the lobby is filled with defaults who are clearly too good to be at 200 points. The other day, some default wall staired me and edited both builds in .5 seconds and 2 shot me with a combat... AT 200 points! Solution: Adjust matchmaking so it takes into EDITING speed, ingame fps (sweats play at 144 fps+), building speed and #of kills per game. 
4. Matchmaking in pubs. PLEASE ADD SBMM!!! Solos and duos are WAY too sweaty and whenever I try to play squads with my friends, there's this ONE squad with 20+ combined kills stomping on us. Solution: Adjust matchmaking so it takes into account everything like in 3.

I see that they vaulted the boom bow along with the dual pistols &amp; dynamite. I feel that I must speak up for the casual community and express their thoughts, through me. 

Epic have folded under pressure yet again to the pro community. They strong armed Epic into vaulting one of the most fun items this game has ever created. Time and time again Epic have listened to the tryhard ttvers' wall of complaints and removed yet another weapon because they want this game to be a boring farming simulator. Removing it from team rumble was one thing, but to remove it from the whole game was another. What's the point of playing if I can't have fun anymore? I'll say it again, the boom bow was NOT overpowered, though it could have been balanced more.

My squad lands at Salty Springs wearing their newly acquired season 9 battle pass skins. They all drop at the same house and get a total of 6 mini shields, a grey pistol, and a few grenades to share between the three of them. 

The only teammate with a gun sees an enemy and immediately takes a shot

&amp;#x200B;

**It misses.**

&amp;#x200B;

4 hell spawn soccer skins turn and dead sprint towards my squad. They quadruple layer ramp push using all metal and easily attain high ground. Way down below, my teammates start to panic and try to run to the safety of a nearby house. One soccer skin chuckles.

“These kids are bots” He screeches at an octave that makes Mariah Carey envious. 

He then lasers one of my squadmates with an infantry rifle and my team builds a small 1 by 1 for cover. The small wooden box provides very little support against the barrage of drum gun fire that commences soon after. Little by little, bullets begin to sneak through their turbo builds and slowly eat away at their shields. 

The soccer skins then descend upon my team’s 1 by 1 and replace every wall. With a swift edit and a few quick shotgun shots, my teammates’ health bars hit zero. 

They cry into their microphones

&amp;#x200B;

**“He’S oNe ShOt”**

&amp;#x200B;

*(An exaggerated claim after connecting a single pick-axe strike)*

&amp;#x200B;

**“ThEy ArE sUpEr LiT”**

&amp;#x200B;

*(A blatant lie)*

&amp;#x200B;

My teammates then continue to sputter incoherent nonsense as they slowly bleed out. Little by little, their red health bars slowly dissipate into nothing. Their cries for help rapidly grow more desperate as their health dips below double digits. Their hopefulness disappears as they look at the minimap and see that help isn’t coming. The last few seconds of their lives are spent helplessly watching as the soccer skins “take the L” over their downed bodies. 

One soccer skins laughs and then asks his  chat to “clip that”

His 1 viewer on Twitch doesn’t clip it.

Because,

**I am the 1 viewer**

Deep within the safety of my bush, hundreds of meters away, I patiently wait for enemies to die so I can complete my “outlive opponents in squad mode” challenge. I pull up the soccer skin’s Twitch, after seeing it in the killfeed, and watch my teammates get downed, danced on, and then executed. I turn off the stream, sink deeper into my bush and make a VERY IMPORTANT mental note to switch to “Don’t fill” for my next squad game. 

I’m sorry, Random Teammates. 

**I’m very sorry**",FortNiteBR

There’s a lot of Pros and Cons to this, and from what I’ve seen so far, the sub-reddit has become the 50v50 LTM over it.
I get each sides points, Drift has been in the item shop countless times, (starlord, male dusk, etc) Like Rook, who is part of the same BP, she has had many styles. But the thing with this is that, it is Drift, Yea it’s not the same Mesh, but his name is in the cosmetic itself, and Drift owners don’t earn anything from this (as far as we know)
Personally I think Drift owners Should get the skin for free, Or a discount, or whatever, I’m not necessarily saying REMOVE the skin from the item shop, but instead giving a suggestion that could make everyone happy (Non-Drift owners and Drift Owners)

I really want to know what you think about the entire situation, If you think it should be it’s own skin, or just a drift style.

First: what some people say, that the summer drift skin should be free for season 5 BP owners is definitely something they shouldn't do. They put work into making this **new** skin, so why would they give it away to certain people for free?

Also, you still have the *""exclusive""* drift skin from the battle pass, so there's no need for an og style or anything like that.

Right now, it seems like Epic's plan is to just release the summer drift like a new skin. But here's my idea (not only for summer drift, but any other battle pass reskin we might get in the future)

People who don't have drift can buy the skin like any other skin. But people who already have it would get a 25% discount. My reasoning for this, is that since these people already have the original, they probably won't feel motivated to buy a similar skin. But if they see that they have a special discount that not everyone has, they might buy it. Overall this might actually make more money for Epic because more people will be tempted to buy the reskins because of the discount

Also, they would get it as a selectable style instead of a separate skin. If Epic's gonna keep releasing battle pass reskins, it might get annoying to have similar looking skins separated

This system would also allow skins from older battle passes to be reskinned and released. The OGs wouldn't be *hurt* because they will still have their OG skin, but people who like the skin can buy something similar.

And Epic won't break their promise of battle pass skins being exclusive, because the original versions will remain exclusive, it's just that similar skins are released to people who might not have them.

  


TL;DR

There's nothing wrong with Epic releasing reskins of BP skins because the original is still exclusive. But people who have the original should get a 25% discount, to motivate them to buy it, and it should be a selectable style for the original instead of a new skin.",FortNiteBR

The combat shotgun range nerf is right for it.,"Like seriously, hitting an enemy for 42 with a range of 40 metres was ridiculous. Almost half of the kill feed comprised shotgun kills aswell, but now they have nerfed its range its balancing out the gameplay more. Rumble matches are no longer dominated by them.



The boom bow being vaulted is a good idea, but I would have preferred it if they changed it slightly.  Removing the explosion and adding headshot damage (so 70 for body and 140 for head). It would reward good aim.



The chug splash is such a great addition to the game. Long range healing will assist greatly when the team is spread out. Maybe they could be used to take shields off enemies too?



I would like to see Epic Games add the ability to replay rumble matches (which isnt an option at the moment) so I can start making a few montages etc.


But overall, good update. What u think?",FortNiteBR

1. Add a half siphon so you get back 25hp per kill

2. Increase the combat shotgun spawn rate and vault the grey and green tac shotgun

3. Increase the farming rate

If these were added, the game would be so much more fun and much less frustrating",FortNiteBR

Battle Pass cosmetics are supposed to be exclusive to that season. And its literally the base stage of Drift, but with and without a shirt. And before you comment ""oh no, the same model! /s"", I don't care about the model, Drift is based off of another model. Drift's head and body were designed from the base model, making it unique, and it was added to the BP, because it was different from the base model. To sum it up, if you're going to re-release a battle pass skin, don't charge the people who paid for it previously for it yet again. And I'm 100% sure if you saw a blue version of the Black Knight, you'd be angry too. (even thought itd be super ugly) NOW you can downvote me to hell, and say ""calm down kid lol"" in the comments.",FortNiteBR

Burst SMG: it feels more like a Tac shotgun more then a SMG. The vaulted Submachine Gun and Suppressed Submachine Gun were my favorite weapons, They were great medium to close range weapons they are exactly what a SMG should be. while the burst SMG is extremely close range only.

Semi-Auto Sniper rifles: it's very clunky to use, it's too loud to have such low damage, but would be to op with more damage they should just vault it. sniper rifles should feel and be epic and legendary to find anyway. the Suppressed Sniper Rifle is amazing because it allows you to snipe without having to be swarmed by enemy's and the Heavy Sniper Rifle allows for 1 shot kills the fair trade off being it's extremely loud and takes forever to reload.",FortNiteBR

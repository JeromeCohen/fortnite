Going to make this short as possible. I am fed up with the SMG spraying. You can't even build and it's a problem for a lot of people. You can't out skill people anymore when they have an SMG in their hands.In my opinion, the game isn't balanced anymore. Bloom is an issue, and the game isn't that fun anymore. LTMs, new weapons and new items entertain the players for a short space of time and they eventually get bored of them. I know epic is trying their best to balance the game, and I understand that. It's not easy to handle millions of people who have issues with the game. I remember when I first started playing it back in October, it will alright. There was no SMG spraying and the weapons were balanced. I stopped playing it because there wasn't any LTMs or things being added to the game in general. I then started to play it again in February and fell in love with the game. The meta back then was probably the best there has been. Between March-May was the period where Fortnite was probably one of the most entertaining and down the line one of the best games ever created. Those are the good old days. I would also like to mention that Season 2 was the best season in fortnite by a mile compared to the later seasons. Anyways, just wanted to express my opinion to the subreddit users. I know a lot of you are gonna be like ""you're just shit at the game"" and stuff, but there's not a lot to do when an SMG is continuously pissing you off. I don't think anyone was angry when double pump and or just the single pump/tac blast did significant damage to opponents in my opinion
That's it for me. Please don't be negative in the comments, and sorry for wasting 10 minutes of your timeüòÇ.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I got an email from my credit card company for a $59.99 charge from Fortnite.  I am at work so I know I did NOT purchase anything.  I call my credit card company and stop the transaction.  They cancel my card, credit back the money, send me a new card, and now its done.  When I got home, I didn't see anything added onto VBucks so I didn't pay much mind.  I changed my password, unsaved my credit card, and that was that. The next day I realize it was probably Save The World that was bought so yes I have that but I don't want to play.  Apparently my 4 year old got on my computer and wanted to play Fortnite and bought the game.  

Yesterday my account was locked out by Epic.  I emailed them explaining what happened and got the automated response.  Does anyone know if they will do anything?  How long does it take to get a response from them?  I have purchased items as well as the battle pass for 4 seasons.  I don't want to lose my account.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past 4 months we've seen Myth go from being considered the best builder in the game, along with being acclimated as a top five player.  A huge population of people even referred to him as the best overall player not too long ago.  Currently he struggles to even get a kill or 2 in competitive settings, while appearing to be one of the lesser talented players, especially in this summer skirmish series.  As we transitioned from the Pub Stomp style of game, into private competitive lobbies where only good players exist, and no potatoes to farm, we've seen Myth fall off a proverbial cliff.  What has caused this sudden fall from grace from the second biggest streamer on twitch?  By not being able to adapt to new metas, being crutched down by abusing a style of play that has been successfully phased out, and losing commitment to being the best as the competition has either caught or surpassed Myth, we've seen the steep downhill nosedive of one of the previous stars the game has had to offer.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to acknowledge that just a few months ago Myth was still considered a notch above the top tier players in the community before the shifting of metas started to begin his downward fortnite spiral.  He attended Ninjas Vegas event, and everybody seemed just as excited, if not more excited at the possible Ninja vs. Myth showdown which never transpired because of Myths love of leaping off of cliffs.  Even though he only had 3 games in his first competitive experience, he struggled and didn't accomplish anything.  He seemed to become determined, and we saw Myth continuously grind and improve his overall game after that.  Fast forward to the buffs of C4, addition of clingers and other splodes, along with the nerfs to buildings in general, and it has made it hard to build and control high ground with ease.  Also, bounce pads, rifts, jump rocks, and atks have made high ground much more vulnerable to being attacked from all directions.  This has been an apparent downfall to Myths religious tactic of camping high in steel or brick 1x1s in the final circle. Even Daquan and other tsm members have teased myth about his 1x1 high ground camp gameplay style, which has been phased out recently.

&amp;#x200B;

With the addition of the moving final few storm mechanic, camping the late game high ground while spamming from above has become somewhat phased out due to the unpredictability and unreliability of that tactic where dynamic gameplay has taken the forefront of the competitive scene.  Over time the entire community gets better by the second, and the skill ceiling continuously gets pushed to its limits. Myth's days of being the best builder are long over as his building style of 3 or 4 months ago is ancient dinosaur meteor history at this point.  Many players edit as good as the best editor, and many players can gain high ground as fast as the fastest builder.   Some players even have become smart enough to win engagements when trapped below in the low ground.  What i've noticed is that myth really struggles with  choosing the right fights.  He seems to get outfragged by even console players routinely.  This is because he pushes with low health sometimes , and doesn't seem experienced at disengaging.  He plays numb minded and either camps or full sends, but he hasn't adapted the gtfo of there into his gameplay.  This one factor is one of the reasons we always see the liquid guys in the final 10 consistently because they wisely disengage, and never overextend themselves unless a necessity.  While Myth's old habits have been phased out, he's also fallen victim to the rise of the unknown beasts of players that just recently got a chance to shine in the competitive scene.

&amp;#x200B;

So where do we see Myth headed in the future?  Can he rise again to being the once dominant force we saw him to be?  Or will we see him fall from grace further until he decides to just be a top notch content creator?  Time will tell the tale that is yet to unfold, but while we see the fall of some of the most popular players this game has had to offer, it is also time to appreciate that there are many other amazing players out there that never had an opportunity to shine until recently in the summer skirmish competitive series.  A prime example of this is the current player that is the king of competitive fornite being NotVivid.  A few months ago NotVivid was a no name who had no following, and has become the most winningest player in fornite to date over just this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr Myth has adapted slower to developing metas than most of the pros, and his habitual camping 1x1 strat has been phased out.  His reign as the best builder in the game is over, and the talent has caught up to him while he hasn't elevated the next level.  Also, many unknown players rose through the competitive scene before they ever had a chance to show the world what they were made of.  Also, many players are putting in 8 hours of scrimming, 7 days a week, and that type of commitment might not be something Myth wants to participate in.",FortNiteBR

I don't know about the rest of you but I thoroughly enjoyed soaring 50s..  The one thing I get sick of in 50v50 is constantly having to worry about same team trolling and killing by shooting down your ramps, or even simply just editing your building so its no longer supported.  Being able to redeploy your glider is the perfect solution to that problem.  Also, one of the issues I have with the way 50v50 is currently structured is that I always have to wait until the middle of the bus route to see where the circle is going, then always land nearby or else you're facing a commute across the entire map.  Being able to redeploy your glider also fixes that problem too because you can just build a ramp and jump to travel large distances.  It also made for some awesome ambushes jumping off cliffs and such to enemies down below.  I think it makes the game mode much more enjoyable.

There are theories out there, that the islands in Battle Royal are ""training grounds"" for those within the world of Stw and that the storm is man made without husks, to simulate that. Perhaps, for whatever reason, the storm manages to infiltrate these ""training islands"" and the husks are let loose.
This could be some kind of ""World's Collide"" LTM, bringing the realm of Stw across to Battle Royale? 

Forgive me if the situations with the circles/damage/husks etc don't sound like they'd work, suggestions would be great! This might not be the greatest idea, it just came to me the other night after I had a strange dream about playing Battle Royale and my teammates were husks!

Not many changes within the circle, however big changes inside the storm. 

FIRST CIRCLE
- Storm does no damage 
- Normal husks spawn frequently within the storm in random locations

SECOND CIRCLE
- Circle changes position like in final circles in normal games, but more than once before storm reaches it and stops moving again, forcing players to constantly change location and possibly run in and out of storm
- Storm does 1 damage per 2 seconds
- Normal husks AND husky husks

THIRD CIRCLE 
- This is the final circle. It is very small. It also moves slowly.
- Storm does 2 damage per second
- Normal husks, husky husks and pitchers spawn within the storm, however only pitchers can cause you damage outside of the storm with the bones they throw. 

Only three ""rounds"" so the game doesn't go on forever, I imagine battling both husks AND other players would get tedious if it took too long.
Meds spawn more frequently, specifically Slurp Juices. 
Trap damage is increased.

The suppressed pistol will getting a rare (blue) variant, along with the dual pistols. The dual pistols will be keeping their legendary and epic variants, this may or may not be the same for the suppressed pistol. The boogie bombs will be dropping in stacks of 2 now, you will be able to hold 3 50-shields at a time rather than 2, and the Bolt action sniper may or may not be getting a uncommon (green) variant. We will also be getting the new Wildcard outfit with red and black ace, spade, heart, and clover mask variants, along with the safe cracker glider and cuff case back-bling, all coming to the item shop rather than being a battle pass exclusive. We will also be getting new High Stakes LTM with challenges, rewarding players with a new crowbar harvesting tool and a spray. The next newest weapon coming will be the Grappler AKA a grappling hook. But, sadly the common, uncommon, and rare variants of the revolver will be vaulted. Although the Hand-Cannon will be remaining, as they work in basically the same way. You also might be able to pick your own default skin (Ramirez, Wildcat, Headhunter , Spitfire, Renegade, Jonsey, Banshee, and Hawk) rather than getting a random one every time. The Cube has also created a new Gravitational Field near Greasy Grove, presumably burning a new ancient rune into the ground. Thats all for today, From now on I will be posting these news updates the day before the next patch. Hopefully the next one will be more organized. Also I will not be posting leaks, only things officially announced. Although if I do for some reason decide to post leaks I will link the leaker's twitter as my source.",FortNiteBR

Theory/idea : the cube is gonna jump to loot creating a crater ( crazy crater )
On loot it's gonna leave and create some sort of tornade destroying loot by slinging it peace by peace over the map creating tombling tombs w/ the found pyramid. When left it leaves a lighting that expends out to several places... created time disorters

1: tilted towers -&gt; tilted treehouse
It will merg with and old forest and in drop tower create a tall tree with a huge treehouse.

2: tomato temple -&gt; merg the temple with the pizzeria having 2 heads üòá

3: greasy grove -&gt; vikings village speeks for itself...

4: containers -&gt; rustic ... suround creaters withvsome sort of factory making it fun to loot.

5: paradise palms and that part of the map -&gt; sandy swamp merg it with ol moisty.

That's that let's continue

The bunker becomes drifts escape he creates the rift to escape the map.

And that building in tilted becomes the new pizzeria for tomato head.

That's all unless I add more. Thanks for reading.

Example: I‚Äôm fighting someone in Paradise Palms and I have the ‚Äúflipping stone‚Äù and I‚Äôm about  to be eliminated so I use it and suddenly I am switched with another player in Wailing Woods who is wandering alone. So now I‚Äôm alone but that random player is in my situation with another player that was switched into my opponents position. Basically every player in the map is switched with someone else. 

I think this could be fun in solo and squads if used properly and could be very strategic! It could pull the players that hide out and it could save players lives. 

This could be maybe be done since the map is split into sections A-J and 1-10. Something like players in A3 could be switched with D10 or something.

Drum gun needs to be nerfed. It has the same clip size as the pre-nerf p90 and 26 damage per shot. Here are some ideas about how this gun should be nerfed.

\-Clip size reduced to 30

\-Damage reduced to 18-19   
\-Rarity increased to epic and legendary  
\-Fire rate decreased  
Any of those points would make it better. At this current point in time shotguns are pretty much trash since you get destroyed before getting to fire your 2nd shot. Also the reason you guys decreased the damage for the shotguns was to make double pumping less annoying. Now that double pump is gone there is no need for the damage nerf to still be there.  
I hope you take this into account and also keep in mind that most people are already playing your game . Catering to noobs won't do anything since most people already play this game! Thank you for reading this.",FortNiteBR

Just like half a second or less to give people a chance to actually shoot someone. Lower the building health just a little and than give us the ability to actually upgrade our walls like in the STW mode. That way people actually take time to build cool forts to defend like when the game came out instead of just building everywhere when a fight starts like everyone does now. Feels like a fighting game when everyone is hugging their block button. Kind of makes snipers/close range weapons supreme.

Maybe just start it as a special game mode and see if everyone likes it. I know Fortnite is a game of extreme skill and that they're worried about messing with that by limiting the way you build but I think it would still be a lot of fun for most of us who don't get 30 kills a match. I think a lot of people would actually like this kind of combat. I mean the game is called FORTnite. It would be cool to focus on building an actual fort. Have a reason to be in the storm circle early setting up something that everyone else can't build in half a second flat using builder pro.

Also being able to craft bullets with metal and wood would be a nice touch. Running out of bullets is never fun.

With that being said, all SMG's have a damage per second of 200+. If you happen to have 150 or 100 HP, a grey SMG can melt you in under half a second. Currently, you cannot one shot with any shotgun, meaning if you're using a Pump or heavy you will have to switch to an alternative weapon anyways. 

I don't really understand the argument at all when people say shotguns shouldn't one shot. If I land a shot with all pellets hitting the head and my opponent lands all his shots with an SMG and kills me before I even have a chance to switch to another weapon, what is the point?

At the end of Season 4 there were so many viable loadouts and you could tailor your loadout specifically to your playstyle. Now, you're basically lost without some sort of spray weapon.

I purchased v-bucks twice and received the emails with the receipts and the charges show on bank statements, yet I have not received the v-bucks. Contacted Epic more than 6 times, and only once have received a generic automated system saying something like ""Epic does not provide free v-bucks, Do not believe sites that offer that!"" . This is ridiculous. I even created a post in the Epic forum and got nothing. 

I dont think any company averaging 300 million dollars a month should have such a shitty customer service experience. Yes I get it, there is a lot of dumb crazy emails being sent every day but it literally feels like there is only one or two customer support agents that epic employees for Fortnite lol. Cmon now. I worked with Comcast many years ago and I can tell you for a fact that has horrible and shitty Comcast CS is, they at least reply even if it is not something you want to hear.

If anything, using the bush gets you killed 100% of the time unless you're versing a mobile. The revolver, in a lot of cases, is a reason I would live through early game. Vaulting it for later just doesn't make sense. Just because it's not a late game item doesn't mean it wasn't useful. Most players call it shit because they don't abuse first hit accuracy, which is the entire point of using a revolver. While I'm just salty that one of my favorite items is being vaulted only to be changed later, the bush is still in the game only being used by new players and content creators (barely). Not sure if it's just supposed to be a running joke but ever since it was released, more often than not it was the reason someone died whether it was because they could barely see or it made them a moving target.

Im playing this game since season 4, so basically 2 full seasons now, but im still feeling like im really bad.

Its not even about the season i started, its how much i have played, i have around 2,8k matches, and 8 solo wins out of 630 games this season, and 5 were within these 2 weeks (maybe i got better, or just had some luck, i dont know). Profile for a better view https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Terror-Machine

Its like, i dont know, my decision making seems to be so bad sometimes? A lot of the times i cant really take advantage of the high ground i get (not saying always, because i never try to get HG for the sake of it, im trying to shot whenever the opportunity is there). My aim kinda slacking at times, but okay, i never really played fps games, and the thing is, if i put so much time and effort into something, i want it to give me equal ""reward"", and i think at this moment im far behind what i should be at.

Any real advices you can guys give? Im even willing to play some duos, squads, playgrounds, let you check my replays, im kinda getting desperated to win/get better (and maybe thats the case).

Important info: PC, Eu servers, playing with headphones 99% of the time (so its not like i dont hear my enemies), i dont have fps issues

Someone was asking for a 20 min gameplay, so whats the best way to record it? I cant record it on replay, because its bugged ,and i dont know what is a good software that wont drop my fps that much, otherwise it seems to be a good idea",FortNiteBR

However I would argue that vaulting regular pistol instead of revolver would be MUCH better choice and to get my point across let me present you with a scenario

You and your opponent land at the same time and enter the same building

You take room A, enemy takes room B, however enemy is luckier and gets a shotgun/smg and you are left with a grey pistol.. there is an enormous difference between DPS of a pistol vs smg/shotgun

if you are forced to fight, you WILL lose that encounter 9/10 times and even if you win it, you will be left with couple hit points left

However if you got revolver instead of a pistol odds even out, because it's an early stage of a game both of you most likely don't have shield yet meaning your opponent could be killed with 1 shot to the head if your aim is on point",FortNiteBR

In addition to that I litterly opened a new account, I couldn't even get into solo snipes, the people were so bad that after 50 matches I realized that MMR is 100% exists, at least in EU, I dont how to heck people dont realize it yet, maybe because only 1% of the playerbase feel it.

I dont wanna open a new account and start from there, I wanna keep playing in my main account, but when there are 10 people last circle, I really want to quit the game at this point.

btw, MMR give Epic Games so much money, noob players are gonna be against noobs (they dont quit the game), good players are gonna be against good players (good players will never quit a game they are good at), this is why so many games use MMR or any skill raiting, but Epic Games just chose to hide it from the cummunity, why?

You may say I am the only one, but since alot of my friends start to quit fortnite of the same reasons, I genuinly think that I am not the only one.",FortNiteBR

Same as emotes, why just the back, if im going to be watching a tv show, I'd sure as hell not want to stare at the main characters back all day, it makes the emote face expressions pointless as no one but you will ever look for those details in a bloodbath game

I think that allowing to see your characters face in game will allow for better content in videos and for streamers

TL:DR: i think that being able to view your character from any angle would be pretty damn awesome, via emotes or normal cam",FortNiteBR

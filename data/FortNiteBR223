First game we landed flush factory just to try the controller see how building is and shit. Ended up winning cause the aim assist is so strong.

We played one game and every kill we got was with a tommy gun just holding left trigger right trigger and the aim assist did the rest of the work.

We only had 10 kills or something combined cause we landed flush and wasted a lot of time trying out the controller.

Over all i would say console is just as easy/hard as pc.

At first it was just a mild annoyance, but as time progressed I started to realize more that it was having a seriously negative impact on my aim.
***
#Why It's Necessary

[Take a look at this clip.](https://gfycat.com/AccurateJadedHapuka)

Looks like a classic case bloom screwing me over, right?

[Well, no. Take a closer look.](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/ImpartialOrderlyHarborseal)

Bloom did nothing here. Of course not; it’s point blank. The problem is that the crosshair doesn’t do its job of showing where to aim. It expands so much that it becomes too difficult for me to see the tiny dot in the center, and I can’t aim accurately because of it. You can’t even tell that my aim was off in the first clip on the first watch, and I sure as hell couldn’t tell in the moment. (I blamed it on bloom and there was a lot of screaming.) 

This is why crosshair customization is necessary.

With the competitive scene in Fortnite growing, this is a feature that is long overdue. Look at other FPS eSports: Counter Strike, Overwatch, Quake, Team Fortress 2. These four all have crosshair settings to match it to your liking. (Rainbow Six is another popular game that doesn’t have them, but it doesn’t matter here because the guns use sights.)

Here are some of the key features that need to be implemented:
***
#1. Toggle Dynamic Crosshair

For those who aren’t familiar with the term, a dynamic crosshair is one that expands/shrinks to show the current accuracy of the gun you’re holding. Of course, for new players this is useful; it helps you get familiar with each gun, when to use them, and it shows first shot accuracy timing. For experienced players, however, it usually becomes a nuisance rather than an aid, since they’ll often be familiar enough with every gun that it just becomes distracting. I personally haven’t seen any CSGO pros using dynamic crosshair.

I have limited programming experience, but I’d imagine this setting can be easily done with an `if` statement when the game tries to update the crosshair.
***
#2. Crosshair Color

There are countless people who prefer to change their crosshair color to light green or purple, because white is too difficult to see in the moment. It’s not a bright color that catches your eye.

All it needs to be is RGB sliders to change the color. It’s not too difficult to do and it allows for maximum degrees of freedom.
***
#3. Crosshair Shape

The 2 feature above are probably enough to really improve the crosshair with a small amount of work, but to really nail the crosshair settings, it should have at least a small selection of crosshair shapes to choose from. Here are some popular ones that should be added:

* [Dot](https://i.gyazo.com/ce68effe707225030d8570c96c061756.png)
* [Simple Cross](https://i.gyazo.com/15407d4f4c53cc51e05217a403f8ac03.png)
* [Open Cross](https://i.gyazo.com/5d9fcfe23ac134826bf2107cd95117a3.png)
* [Open Cross + Dot](https://i.gyazo.com/30ead2fa7667b751c46916e692a72391.png)
* [My personal crosshair of choice, the circle](https://i.gyazo.com/a7eb123d2c9ed8fabb6934eaa5a53a0e.png)
* [Circle + Dot](https://i.gyazo.com/341237479a77528ce0774d2790cae5dc.png)

And of course, the ones that already exist in the game can be included as options.

Ideally, you should also have the option to choose different crosshairs for different guns, and also the ability to change the crosshair size and thickness. The ability to upload your own custom crosshairs would be cool too, but that’s more of a luxury and not at all necessary.

This feature would definitely take more work to implement, so if it does get added, please take the time to perfect it.
***
If you see this, thanks for taking the time to read through it and I hope it gets implemented.
(Apologies for the clickbaity title by the way -- I know bloom still accounts for some moments but I think a lot of it gets confused with poor aim because of the crosshair.)

2. All previous tier 100 skins have been male.
3. Female versions of previous tier 100 skins, or similar, (Red Knight, 
Oblivion) have looked really good, and would be worthy of being tier 100 skins.
4. There's no female skins with unlockable styles.

I think it's time we got a tier 100 female skin, or at least the skin we unlock for completing 7 weeks of challenges.

The only reason it became so popular in the first place is due to the once in a life time chance that it got, that once in a life time chance being that, at the time, the battle royal genre was fresh, new, exciting, and extremely popular, if we then take the other things going for it such as the game being free, rated teen, available for consoles, and being able to be run on almost any computer, you can see the extremely lucky conditions that the game had going for it. If it wasn't for this the game would only have a few thousand players. If you take away all the hype and the circumstances surrounding the game during Battle royals release, then the game would only be seen as a okay game. This game is completely cancerous/toxic due to all the kids and the fan base. I would even go as far as saying it is even more so then Minecraft. 

Fortnite is a Toxic and overrated game that does not live up to the hype and expectations that everyone gives it.",FortNiteBR

I have some friends, which “quit”  Fortnite either because they seem to not get used to it, (even if they play daily). Or that they got bored and are pros and that it is there favorite game. 

The issue here is that (mainly), the bad players who seem to “never” get good to the game, even if they try not to do the same mistakes, are getting more angry each day, I have a brother like this, and he sucks at Fortnite. Every time he kept playing he got depressed more and more. But I am lucky due to the fact that I never get less than 3 kills a game. 

And that’s not all, Fortnite needs to add a bot mode and editing feature, preferably Playground setting, where you can play offline, and adjust the difficulty, circle, and god mode features, and adjust how fast they can build. A Which will favor people also with bad internet, including ppl who want to play on the Nintendo Switch.

I know that there is going those type of ppl that would always disagree with every idea (no offense), but please, just, no hate okay, This is just my opinion and mainly my brother’s opinion.",FortNiteBR

Never had problems before but suddenly it's not working. My steps are below:  


* Start Epic Games Launcher, choose an install directory
* Wait for Fornite to start ""Installing""
* Cancel installation(This is so it creates a Fortnite directory in the install location)
* Copy and paste full 20gb directory over the newly created one
* Resume Installation and the Launcher ""verifies"" my files  


This is where the issue is. Before it would verify the files and let me play. Now it just deletes 20gb worth of files out the install directory and re-downloads the whole game?? I have a slow internet connection so I don't really want to download 20gb worth of files. Any help? ",FortNiteBR

He gets out of bed every day and shows up to work at a toilet factory dressed like a G and then works his tail off month after month on a war-torn island. He didn't even smile in this picture because he wanted to get back to work.  Not all heroes wear capes and this particular hero is relentless. The Flush Factory employee of the month is just one month away from winning employee of the month for 12 months in a row making him an obvious frontrunner for employee of the year (might need fact check on when he first appeared).  I hope Epic will at least update the plaque when he hits the year mark, but ideally give out free pink leopard print fedoras and soul patches for everyone's skins.

I died. He took no damage from it.
In my second solo, I shot at a guy who had just killed someone else and was looting, got a nice crit on him, he backed round a corner and left the game so I didn’t get the kill.

1) when you cross play, you play on a separate “cross play servers” which consist of mobile, switch, console and pc players

2) when you play cross play, you play on which ever servers the party leader is on 

3) when you play cross play, you play on the best platform 

It’s been officially stated by Epic that #3 is how cross play works. 

Here is an in depth explanation of #3.

When you cross play, you play on the best/ most stable servers. 

**Example** If you are playing duos and one player is an xbox player and the other player is a pc player, then you will play on just pc servers, not “xbox and pc” servers or “cross play servers”. those servers do not exist.

This means that if you queue up with on pc with a mobile player, you are play on just pc duo servers. (Epic would never put pc/ console players on mobile servers when mobile servers can barely support just mobile players.) This also means that if two pc players are playing regular duos, then they could come upon a duo that is pc and mobile, but they would never know. 

example 1: In this very famous,  [I JUST KILLED NINJA clip](https://youtu.be/GyRJtT3ACjM) , Ninja is solo squading on pc servers and comes upon a squad that consists of 3 ps4 players and one pc player. this means all 3 ps4  players and one pc player are playing on pc servers. 

example 2: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-august-2018

Under “Input-based match making” Epic clearly states how crossplay works 

example 3: yesterday i was playing squads on mobile with my friends on xbox. on mobile you cannot “thank the bus driver”, nor is there streamer mode. As soon the match starts the kill feed is filled with “Streamer [123] has thanked the bus driver” so i obviously knew i was playing on xbox servers. And then as i was playing, i noticed that the majority of players actually built when they were being shot at, which is rare on mobile.  Finally, i saw a lot of season 1 and 2 skins, which is also extremely rare on mobile. 


TLDR; When you play cross play, you play on the best platform servers. which means if you play with squads with a pc, mobile, console, and switch, you are playing on solely pc servers.  Queuing up with mobile players will not put you on mobile servers.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Compact SMG first came out, it was blatantly overpowered; it's ammo was extremely common, deadly accurate, high dps and to top it all off it had 50 bullets allowing you to take on multiple opponents without having to reload. Until it was nerfed, many players didn't bother using shotguns instead running multiple Compact SMGs. The initial nerf was a welcome one, decreasing accuracy bonus and damage falloff, bringing it more in line with other weapons.

So many players (including myself) switched over to the Drum Gun for choice of SMG and building destruction, as it was clearly more effective than the Compact SMG and far more common to find. Then came the SMG nerf as ' *they should feel good against structures, but not consistently be the best option in multiple scenarios.'* The Drum Gun and the Compact SMG were nerfed - DG had decreased accuracy and damage fall off, and became more difficult to find. Meanwhile, the damage on the Compact SMG was decreased as well as the magazine size. 

For the purpose of this post, we're going to be comparing the rare Drum Gun and legendary Compact SMG.

As it stands right now, the Drum Gun does more damage (27 to the Compact SMG's 21), more structure damage (only one point difference, but still worth mentioning), and only has a uncommon and rare rarity compared to the Compact SMG's epic and legendary rarities.

With near identical reload times, the **only** thing that the Compact SMG has over the Drum Gun is the fire rate is faster by 1 unit (Drum Gun has 9 whilst Compact SMG has 10). Some can argue that you come across medium bullets less than light bullets but that only applies to specific situations (early game, very far drops) where you run out of ammo for it to be a viable argument.

So it's always made me wonder, ***why*** bother picking up a Compact SMG over a Drum Gun, ever? Is there something obvious I'm missing, or does Epic need to consider bringing the two guns more in line with each other (whether that be nerfing the Drum Gun or buffing the Compact SMG)?

Note: Not trying to bash or complain about any of the guns, but trying to find a legitimate reason why the Compact SMG is better than the Drum Gun. When I'm carrying a blue Drum Gun and come across a Compact SMG I don't even consider switching them out and for a Legendary weapon it really should be the opposite.",FortNiteBR

Retail, Greasy and Pleasant are perfect examples of this. Salty too, I guess. 

Risky, Fatal, Lucky and Paradise are all... probably fine????

Haunted and junk may need more atk/rift spawns to be viable spots, but otherwise they’re pretty decent spots for loot. 

Wailing needs to be revamped in some way. 

Tilted should be left alone, because it’s Tilted. 

Dusty could use some work. Last season’s Dusty was the perfect Dusty. As in, week 10 Dusty Divot. Lots of hop rocks, shield shrooms, trees, and if I’m not mistaken, the fully functional research facility had more chests than the broken down one. 

Lonely could probably use 3-4 more chests. 

Tomato just got a revamp, so

Snobby is fine, *for now*, but when season 5 ends I’m sure the rifts will disappear and easy travel wont be a thing. 

Flush could use some sort of revamp. More chests, more stuff, just whatever. Maybe it doesn’t. I don’t go there usually, so

Loot Lake. For a location with the word **Loot** in the title, it’s a h*cking disappointment. It needs some houses on the water, maybe some lakeside hotels, a pier that has stuff.... I have no idea. It needs more LOOT. 

Lazy is fun, but could use a few more chests.

The design is rather simple, with it just being a white suit and a mask. A design this simple shouldn’t be legendary, and if it were not as many people would buy it. More evidence of it being an epic skin would be that, despite the customization, Tomatohead also had customization, and the customization is almost a completely new outfit, with Wildcard only changing it’s mask.

However, the skin does come with a contrail. The only item shop skin we’ve seen come with a contrail was Ravage, a legendary skin. Despite this, the skin will still most likely be epic, as Ravage has a much more complex design, as well as a very good back bling, unlike the simpler design of the cuff case.

Actually almost feels like I’m playing Season 3 again. 

SMG’s aren’t even bad (in terms of spam) anymore due to their limited clips/faster fire rate and lower damages. But the Tommy gun has the largest magazine and most damage (not sure about DPS) of all of them. It provides way too much utility in both close and medium range. I will run a Tommy over a scar if I’m rocking shotty/splodes/sniper/meds in my for other slots, and it really shouldn’t be that way.

I just don’t think the Tommy Gun has a good fit in the game and would be better taken out, and had the idea revised a tad. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite became a super tryhard game, every lobby is full of sweaty pro kids. From epic build fights at the top 10 alive, it turned to epic build fights at top 70, it turned from a casual fun game, to a casual punishing game, to a tryharding game.

And it sucks, it fkin sucks! I used to enjoy it so much with my squad but now every game has to be tryhard or you die at the first enemies you meet.

Not saying everyone should be a noob, but as a casual I just don't know how to build those super fast stairs, and frankly don't want those super long fights where you end up using 500 materials and have to farm them again (Im not a pro player i don't end up every game with 10+ kills where I don't need to farm materials), so yeah I know how to build a 1 by 1 fast, i know how to build the double ramp use the traps efficiently but its not near enough to actually win games now, and tbh I don't have the time nor do I want to just hop on playgrounds and train for hours till I become a pro.

So I know there is that 50v50 for casuals, but I want to enjoy at least Squads without being a super tryhard, maybe bring back that game mode with the win counts or what ever it was, to make the tryhards go there and casuals could actually enjoy the game, cause it turned into a casual punishing game, and thats really a bummer...",FortNiteBR

1) There is not such a big spray Meta. Just the Minigun.

2) The close Combat came back to Shotguns.

3) You don't need much time to loot. Often one house is enough.

4) Most of the weapons need more skill than with the Spray Meta.  (an exception is the Rocket Launcher)

Have you anything to add? We really hope Epic won't void this mode.

I was kinda bored and digging into comment sections of Fortnite posts on Twitter/Instagram and I noticed a surprising amount of people who claim that ""Fortnite is Dying"". 

Well, I have a few reasons which I think suggest that Fortnite WILL NOT die in a while. Firstly, figures show that Fortnite is still one of the BIGGEST games out there alongside DOTA, CSGO and other massive titles. This shows that Fortnite is really high up in terms of playerbase, and it will take some significant changes to deter their players from returning to the game. 

Another reason I see people say Fortnite is dying is because of the concept of a ""Battle Royale"" game which means that most people will get bored of doing the same stuff and it will just die like that (This was from some posts back in May which proves how Fortnite seems to have lived longer than those guys expected).

Now that is true to some degrees, however Epic Games seems to know how to change the game up every season giving us new places, mechanics, guns and items to use and explore. Additionally, the game is updated every single week with new items and cool changes for everyone to check out. The removal of double pump and implementation of the new spray meta really helps out new players and narrows the skill boundary between pros and noobs, allowing the game to be more open and allowing for new and returning players to jump right into the game without having to climb any kind of skill ladder.

In conclusion, although the hype of Fortnite will fall and the huge amount of 12 year old fad followers will decrease, I hope that Epic will realise that their game still has a decently sized playerbase which needs to catered to...

I've been playing fortnite since season 3 and trust me, I think by far this is the worst meta ever, you have literally no chance against someone if they know how to spray you down with a tommy, you need to counter it with also a tommy.

Building isnt an option:
Most of the pvp' I get I use Drum gun/Pump or Heavy just like the enemy does, we start bulding and buidling and who evers pumps the other, is fucked. You rush with Tommy or get rushed, literally tries to walk into my 1x1 while spraying tommy, it has become a little boring to me.

Reducing Drum Gun Spawn:
This ""nerf"" was a buff.
I see way more drums than before, every enemy I kill has one, i swear i almost get between 4 or 6 each game in chests, also, blue tommy in a blue vending machine costs 275 wood, that is literally PAY TO WIN.

I fully understand fortnite is not a competitive game, is more focus about a ""casual game"" but cmon, you can easily destroy a bambi with a tommy, they have no chance.

It's a love/hate story with this stupid lovely drum gun, either you love to use it or you hate when someone else's uses it.

Some of these ideas come from other reddit posts, others ar just my strange ideas. I hope some people agree with me, please feel free to discuss them in the comments.


Balancing

Guns

Deagle less damage fallof and less bloom and higher shoot frequency (like heavy shotgun, does similar damage, but it is still more difficult to aim with the deagle)

pistol more damage, always full accuracy 

double pistol shoot quicker, but more bloom while jumping

AR less bloom, less fallof, instant full accuracy when standing still

Rocketlauncher vault / remove or less damage (unfair if you have Highground), more bloom, smaller explosion radius, every color same reload time (better color should have better weapon)

buff famas and burst (less recoil)

nerf P90 (smaller magazine)

buff double shotgun (spray of tactical, not op because of reload time)

shotgun delay only between identical weapons (pump – pump, smg – smg), not between different weapons (pump – tactical shotgun, smg – silenced smg)

without aiming there should be a short delay bevor shooting (realism, less jumping around closerange

in general: buff bad weapons (shotguns) nerv overpowered weapons (p90) (every weapon good in own way, less luck more skill), less jumping around 



Grenades

Stink bomb double as much damage (grey grenades are better then purple stinm bombs , Stack of 10

Granades should all do a small amount of damage through walls

damage drop of (clinger stuck to you &gt; next to you &gt; further away &gt; through a wall)



Bushes

looks like empty bush, better aiming



Else

Every Weapon less damage (longer fights, more skill (who can constantly hit), less luck (not dead instantly because of a small mistake))

Bring jetpack back, but without being able to shoot while using (only for travel or regaining highground, but without people flying above you and shooting rockets at you from midair)



Make fortnite more enjoyable 

Always have phases for chest-weekly-challenges, not for kill challenges (thats where you need many people on one spot)

Let weekly challenges stay, although you have completed them (firerings, timed trials, etc.) (I would like to try to complete the challenges in all locations, but after you have finished the needed amount, all disappear)

Water prevents fall damage or regenerates health when you walk through it (otherwise it is just annoying)

Lower the normal jump hight (all the jumping around with shotguns is annoying; it is not very realistic that you can jump higher than your body hight)

make knocked down players drop all their items infront of the killer, but not be able to get finished unless their whole team dies or they do

not get picked up on time (it is very annoying to get finished instantly because the killer needs ammo, if his team dies then, your team has to go on without you, but if you cannot be finished and drop your items, you and the killer can both be happy) (infront of the killer, because if you are in a sniper battle and cannot finish, it would just go on because everyone just gets revived and picks his items back up)

finishing should not count as damage (to easy for challenges)

if you knock down an enemy, that should count as kill a kill for challenges, even if he gets revived (annoying if you do not get a special weapon challenge finished, because you did not get the kill, only because he gets revived)

reviving should be quicker if several teammates are reviving

delay after playcing a tile on the same place for several times (no spam building without beeing able to get through)

more materials („the battle is building“) (materials from chests or floor loot 50, materials from braking stuff doubled; ok because of prevented spam building)

you should be able to get all weapons from chests (why smgs but not pump shotguns?)

campfires should give you atleast 75 health in the way the slurp juice does, because they are pretty rare and nearly every other way of healing 50 health is easier and quicker

grant much more xp for kills and revivals (at least in 50 v 50(or something else to get people to revive their teammates))

grant xp for damaging oponents (not finishing) (kill stealing would not be so annoying then)

let Items drop down if the floor underneath them is destroyed 

have a normal shrinking eye of the storm in 50 v 50 (being at the opposite end of the map as the circle is is very annoying)

you should have the same orientation as bevor, when jumping into a rift

reset orientation option for rotating stairs (if you switch back to stairs after you have ratated them, they would be in the normal orientation again)

rotate stairs by 180 degrees instead of 90

more loot (maybe even a chest) in small 1x1 houses (you do not have to land in popularity areas to get atleast some loot; normally their is nothing or only ammo in these houses)

ammo vending machines 

be able to steer ATKs with mouse and not only keyboard (like shopping carts)

Replay mode: do not switch players every time you skip / move your time marker; extra keybinds (move drone up, down, faster, slower), teleport drone using map, show correct amount of kills at the time under map, gameplay view like real gameplay (show no damage to objekts, show health, inventory, materials, editing and building preview, etc.)

Infinite amount of time in play ground as long as not every player is AFK (I guess their is no difference in the workload of the servers if you stay in one match for two hours, or if you join two matches for one hour each; plus you can do so much more)

Be able to join the playground match of a friend

Be able to spectate your friend playing while waiting for him in rhe lobby

If somebody joins your lobby while playing, show it in chat in a different color, give a sound, and constantly show a small symbol (like the spectate eye) somewhere on the screen, or put him in teamchat (you otherwise often do not notice it)

Emote wheel in lobby

Old Llamas (500 of every material; rocket ammo)

Keep Inventory and respawn with full shield function in playground 

Have a healthbar instead of an arrow above teammates in 50 v 50

If you sneak, pull out weapons silently and do not get hit by ceiling trap (sneaking is not very useful otherwise)

Have all LTMs always for all modes (solo, duo, squad)

Triple mode (three person squad)

Have the glider open very near to the ground (like jumppad) in playground after respawning

Make the ground solid from both sides, that there is no advantage for people glitching under the map

Make the player slower while jumping as a disadvantage over walking straight (very difficult to snipe nowadays with everyone jumping around)

If you replace a daily team challenge (team placed 6.), do not replace it with another team challenge (team placed 12.)

Push to mute instead of push to talk (while in a gun fight you do not want to hold a button, but sometimes you do not want to be heard by everyone)

Kills after your death (person gets finished, clinger explodes later etc.) should count for challenges 

Why do lobbies need about 30s before starting, when you will instantly have a teammate if you play random duos / squads (not a big deal, but it would be a time saver)

Ranked mode (the game is very difficult for new players, as everyone is getting better, playing with people with the same skill level would be much more fun, and it would not be very difficult to make)

Keep LTMs (limited time modes) for atleast 3 weeks, because in one week you can not even get used to it completely, or you are just beginning to like it but in then vanishes suddenly 

Make 50 v 50 soaring 50s again (not solid gold)

On mobile: make the movement cross bigger (it is nearly impossible to stear straight, or go only slightly to the side with an ATK); only have App Store Updates, not ingame (they do not download automatically and they do not download or install in the background)







Just some other ideas

Be able to do emotes while falling or bouncing and not directly moving

Be able to heal while jumppading

If killed by sniper, say in chat with or without noscope

Have findable pickaxes that deal more damage closerange to oponents and buildings

Have keybinds for preedited buildings 

Let the player run faster, if he has not got any weapon in his inventory (to escape, because he can’t fight)

Have bullet reflecting walls in some buildings belonging to the map (you can only brake them with your pickax and you can hit yourself if you shoot it

LTMs: no resources, just weapons; shotguns and snipers only (sniper mode but without noscoping at close range)

Let gas stations explode and deal damage if you shoot them

Make the new item appear more often on the update day (for trying out)

Give much more wood when you brake a filled chest as an alternative to opening it



These are just my ideas that I think would improve the game. If you read until here, you are a very nice person. Be aware that I am not a native speeker, so please do not hate me for stupid spelling mistakes.

Good day folks!

I want to go from 'decent' to being a good player, but I'm not really sure how to besides practicing in playground. 

I honestly would love to 1v1 someone who is well above my skill level who would be willing to spend time and give me tips along the way. I would even pay for lessons if need be. 

If any of you have suggestions on how I can improve, it would be appreciated !",FortNiteBR

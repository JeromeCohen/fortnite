You get no points for kills, so what's a showdown? You get only points for placement, you can have 0 kills and still get points making to top 3. All you do is jerking off at the edge of the circle. This was a survival mode, not showdown. Everyone just camped it out. On late circle there was 5 players with 10 bases and nobody peaking or making a fart.

And the guy who won #1 plays in Oceania (need to confirm) servers with no good players and on console. He also streams on Twitch with same name, but it's 480p quality and you can tell why he won 48 games out of 50, because he literally plays vs bots on his region.

To make it fair and square there should be points multiplier for kills and separate leaderboards for every platform. Top players like Svennos didn't even make it to Top 100, Ninja isn't even on Top 1000.

Just my two cents, a little rant. I hope next actual 'showdown' will be better organized.

During this stream, the delay on the Pump Shotgun and Double Pumping to no surprise came up as a topic. As double pump is back to being pretty much the same as it was all those patches ago.

Tfue himself has suggested a possible fix that would bring the Pump Shotgun back in line with the other two shotguns.

The delay to equip the Pump Shotgun would be same as other shotguns. However the magazine size would be 1, just like the hunting rifle. This would prevent double pumping, but would still make the pump shotgun a good weapon for not having such a long delay, however to have it preform similar to before, the reload speed would have to be 0.7 or 0.8 seconds (per pellet), such as the reload speed of the Tactical and Heavy Shotgun (varies by rarity), to maintain the same firerate as the current version. But it wouldn't lower the skill ceiling that the current version has with the delay on the building/editing peaks.

Clip from the stream in which Tfue has suggested this fix -https://clips.twitch.tv/AlluringResilientTitanBCouch

Recording of a short sample clip in which I compare the normal fire rate and one when reloading - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m88OxY6Oh_M

In the begining of the clip I just empty the whole clip as fast as possible, and then I keep reloading and firing off the 1 shot a couple of times. Keep in mind this is with the Pump shotgun reload speed which is 0.9 seconds (per pellet), and it still just as fast as the usual fire rate, Reducing it down to 0.7-0.8 seconds would just make it smoother even though its not neccessary.",FortNiteBR

The latest competitive mode diden't even count kills, and everyone knew that it was possible to get into top 100 by just riding the storm and avoiding conflict until top 3. 

This is just one of many examples of how Epic continously has ignored aggressive players, and almost forced people to just avoid conflict, if they want to win. On the other hand, with almost every patch, there has been something in there that would benefit passive players. 


Most people agree that it is a lot harder to win with an aggressive playstyle, but inbetween all that has been said, and with building being so inconsistent compared to season 3, and shotguns being more of a RNG generator, 9/10 it's more of a frustrating experience, than it's fun to be on the offense. Is this really how the game should be played, Epic? When are you going to reward the ones that are aggressive players, and often are the ones that has played this game for the longest time?

Think about it, the game started off with just guns and grenades, launch pad, jump pads, traps and its brand new building mechanic. That, for me, was pretty simplistic and likeable. 

Nowadays when I play the game people are flying around with jetpacks, jumping 20 mts time and time again for like 1 minute straight with this silly blue rock(even worse if they decide to use impulse nades), there's so many shitty items cluttering the game that I have to open like 8 chests to get shields, bad players now can just panic and put a port-a-fort giving them inmediate advantage, and finally I think the first shot accuracy patch and the shotgun change patch collectively ruined the game's already clunky gunplay.

I mean, the game feels like such a mess right now. Landing  shots from 100+ meters and dealing 20 damage, having to stand still like a dummy for my weapons to actually shoot where I'm aiming at, shotguns are overpowered as fuck and will never cease to be,  assault rifles are almost as inprecise as a SMG... I could go on and on.

Given that I am not liking this game anymore, my perspective of it has changed a bit. If I'm to be completely honest here, it's a cartoonish game designed for children, why? Because it's spammy ,noob friendly, and doesn't punish mistakes. Every single fight is about spamming ramps and walls to get the vertical advantage on your opponent, then pull out the ''tactical'' shotgun and go BOOMJUMPBOOMJUMPBOOMJUMP until someone dies or decides to start spamming buildings again. I could be tapping someone with my crosshair right on their head but the accuracy of this game is so fucked that he can just spray at me aiming at center mass and outdamage me, even land some headshots too. That's just bad quality gunplay. It's braindead and luck based.

Don't even get me started on the explosives, they're everyone's panic button. Like you hear a few thuds from a distance and suddenly you're supposed to fend off 6 grenades with 1 second in between explosions. And RPG? Build 2 ramps, aim at the floor, shoot, enemy is dead.


So yeah, I'm pretty much done with this cartoon shit game. I like athletic, skill based, reaction inducing first person shooters. Not this spammy, braindead, third person peeking ,clash of clans lookalike shooter.

To quote another redditor from the highly derailed thread earlier: 
&gt;Never have I ran into a trap and went ""Goddamn that shit is OP"" and not ""I'm fuckin' stupid""

I'm a pretty big fan of dropping tilted towers, and I know I can't be the only one excited to find a trap when I land in big grey. Throw it up on the ceiling and *hope I get a free idiot kill.*
Or hearing someone else throw one up and tensing up a bit.

Traps being able to one shot a shieldless opponent made for far more interesting early-gameplay where most people wouldn't have shields and would be forced to *pay attention.* 

I can see being the down on your loot-luck teammate stuck with only 1 handmedown mini-shield and dying to an unseen trap (*because you didn't look*) being a frustrated mechanic of the game. I would argue that if you have a **SHIELD** that you should be able to let your guard down enough to where you can get away without looking at the ceiling on the otherside of every doorway you walk through. 

A 25 damage nerf isn't unreasonable, as traps are essentially place and forget they shouldn't be able to do over 50% of your max hp ~~when your dumbass forgets to look up.~~ But 75 damage traps are an **abomination**. Not only is this big of a nerf unwarranted, *nobody fucking asked for this*.

Before everyone starts saying ""You just want free kills"" or ""Traps are meant to be damage not deathmachines"" ~~I would like to point out you can look up~~ 

1) If you hear a trap go up around you and ***you die to it***, then you're an idiot (and I deserve my ""Free kill"" for taking the time to place the trap in a strategic location) 

2) If you're running through Tilted at literally any point in the game and aren't on your tip toes then you deserve to die to that *guy who died 5 minutes ago in tilted*'s trap. It's no different than those assholes who corner camp tilted all game with a shotgun waiting for you to walk by.

3) ***It's like ten to twenty, eight foot long spikes firing from the ground at high velocity in a spread big enough to cover an entire tile.*** IF that isn't designed to kill you in one hit then whatever, but a max hp dipshit should not be able to walk through that thing **TWICE**.



/endrant 

With all that said I got my trap challenge pretty easily this week, tilted towers is great for it, most people won't have full hp there in the early game and apparently a lot of people are at least stupid enough to warrant a trap nerf.

To exploit, by definition, means ""to *make full use of* and *derive benefit* from something"". Double pumping is *making full use of* a developer oversight that allows players to shoot guns faster by switching between them quickly and *deriving benefit* by having a completely overpowered and unfair weapon on their side.

I suffer from major depression and anxiety.

I lost my will to play video games around a year ago. My depression became so severe, I lost everything I loved to do. I would just stare at my phone and sleep. It became unbearable last year, when along with my depression, I lost the most important person in the world, my grandmother, on April 9th, 2017.

I remember visiting her, having her babysit me all the time. She was the only person I could tell everything to, I told her I liked girls too, and she gave every ounce of love and acceptance. Life decided to rip her away from me. 

I discovered Fortnite around December 11th, my friend made me play it even though I didn't feel like it. that's when I started playing. I fell in love. And have been ever since. My first skin was Crackshot! The art, the colors, the style, and the friendship. 

Oh my god, the FRIENDSHIP.

Even when I'm playing with my usual squad, solos, or playing with new people, I always feel welcome, it doesn't matter that I like girls as well as guys, it doesn't matter that I struggle with depression, it doesn't matter that I'm not perfect. 

Everyone is just here to have fun, and make the best of things. Fortnite especially had just been my absolute gift, I have been playing for 6 months now and it has brought my love of gaming back.

I still have depression, it still haunts me every waking minute but playing Fortnite with my friends helps distract me, and I feel a whole world of happiness when I play.

So to Epic, my friends, and the r/FortNiteBR community; thank you. 

You have made my happiness possible when I was close to leaving this world behind. This is not just a video game. It's bringing people together, it makes me happy.

And I can't wait for the future.

Thank you.

[https://imgur.com/a/NOT3i98](https://imgur.com/a/NOT3i98)

Here is my 50 games that I played and my placements. As you can see I never placed outside of the Top 10 \(somehow\) and I ended up winning 33 of the games.

Let me start off by saying that the objective is to place as highly as possible and as consistently as possible and that kills had no impact on your score and I know a lot of people believe this does not show the most skillful players \(this might be true\), but the point of battle royale is to win and to win \(or close to winning \) consistently still takes a tremendous amount of patience and knowledge of the game while still being able to win fights when needed.

THE STRATEGY

The most important part of the this game mode was the landing. I often landed far away from the bus path and late into the buses path. Most of my landings were unnamed locations that still had decent loot but were far away from the path. My most popular landing spots were the houses south of Snobby, the houses north/northeast of wailing woods, backside of moisty mire, the mansion on the east side, motel, and sometimes I would venture to Junk Junction, Lucky Landing, and Haunted Hills if I felt I had a ""good bus"" for it. Generally, I would get decent weapons and keep all the shield and medkits I could hold. I would say the best loadout was an AR, a pump, a tac shotgun, small shields, and medkits. I would not waste my time with snipers you are more likely to die if you try to peek someone with it. If I found a grenade launcher or RPG I would drop a shotgun for it.

After the landing and gathering decent loot if I was inside the circle I would try to keep looting low traveled areas on the EDGE of the circle while keeping a closer eye out for enemies. If I liked my loot setup and I was in circle I would sometimes sit in a protected area and wait as the next circle came in and watch my placing rise. This is also a great time to farm materials. I would say to gather at least 500\-600 materials by the time second circle spawns. Helpful tip: Leave 50hp on trees so people do not see trees ""fall down"" and come after you. I found myself to be using more materials in this game mode for some reason.

My worst placing was 8th place and getting consistently high placings is all about maneuvering yourself to the next circle. As much as it bothers me, hiding is the best way to get high placings and I did it for a lot of my games, but there is a method to it. It is a lot more than hiding in some random bush or random attic. I was always on the edge of the circle and had to move to next circle multiple times a game and find new hiding spots. There is not one hiding spot that will get you top 5 every game, but here are some things I did to stay out of sight. Don't build up a 1x1 three tiles high its too obvious. Instead build a small 1x1 on the backside of a hill at the edge of circle. Try to find a place where you are protected on three sides, you never want to be shot in the back. Always WAIT until the the last second to move to the next circle \(without taking storm damage\). If you are the last one to the new circle you won't be shot in the back and most of the time people won't be looking for you. Sometimes, if I had the medkits to spare, I would spend a minute or two in the storm, super low risk of dying and it boosts your placing.

This is what I did every game to get into the Top 10, but once your in the top 10 and the circle is small enough you will get into fights. There is not much I can say here except that you have be better than the remaining players. Everyone left is extremely good and this is where you separate the men from the boys this is where you make a lot points 10th place was 65 and first was 100. This is where the majority of my fights happened and this is where I had a lot of fun. I have over 400 wins but being top 5 in solo showdown still made me nervous, my hands were always sweating and I got really hype every time I pulled out a victory.

This could have been longer but I didn't want to be redundant. If you have any specific questions about this strat just let me know.

OPINION

A part of me dislikes how slow this game mode was and I do not generally like playing like that. I am usually playing super aggro squad games, but this was a nice change of pace. I get the idea that there is a lot of camping and slow play and it was kind of a grind over only a few days, but I still enjoyed playing it. It brought the joy back to winning games like when I first started. If they were to do this game mode again I would play it, but there is some changes I would like to see. First off, I think the storm should move in quicker, it would make games shorter and less camping and I would like to see more ways to move quicker around the map to compensate the quicker storms. Secondly, I think you should get more relative points for coming in 1st, its the whole point of battle royale. I am actually ok with no points being rewarded for kills IN THIS GAME MODE. Ideally, I would like to see an additionally mode that focuses more on kills which I think would show who has the best mechanics in the game and I, personally, will play the hell out of that. I don't see why we can't have multiple modes and competitions that create different challenges and let every type of player thrive. Also, I think tournaments in this game are great. I haven't played in any, but I love watching tournament games, it is a completely different way to play the game and it is so fun to watch.

Here is a link to my stats on fortnite tracker. Here is a mind blowing stat: I have played less than 100 total solo games on fortnite INCLUDING my 50 games of solo showdown. I am mostly a squad player with my friends, but I am pretty proud of that stat.

You put 100 million dollars into esports but can’t fix the actual game. Shotgun damage doesn’t work, there are numerous bugs, and weapon bloom is horrible. Make the game not based on straight up luck on whether I’ll one pump someone or do 22. Everyone misses over half their ar shots after switching from another gun at short/medium range while some people hit everything. Fix the bloom, make shotgun damage normal, and just address bugs like the camera coming out of the bus. This game is trying to be an esport but will fail if the game isn’t fixed.

Anything you do in this game leads to utter BS. The hit boxes in this game are the absolute worst hit boxes in any game. The hit registration is terrible on these servers. Black Ops 4: Blackout is going to kick this game's butt because Epic Games only wants to add something new each week and not improve their game quality.

A countless number of people that I know are quitting the game because this game is on a path that CS:GO is on. They are losing players and money because they only add skins and not new improvements to the game. The only real reason we play this game is because it is free. We wouldnt play if it wasnt free because this game is absolutely disgusting. When the well-known game Call of Duty takes their own view of Battle Royale and puts it into perspective with amazing graphics, great guns, attachments, and possible abilities; there is nothing that Fortnite will have over it. Call of Duty's hitboxes have been great, no complaints about them ever and it should stay like that. Fortnite and CS:GO are known for terrible hitboxes and hit registration.

Most people play this because it is free, friends can get it because it is free, and the building which I hate. The building in this game adds an effect that takes away from legit skill in FPS games. Aiming. You don't need to aim in this game to be good, you just need to build. Building takes a key quality out of FPS games which is stupid to me and others. 

FPS games are centered around being the best mentally and physically, you need to know strategies and what people's next decision could be. And physically meaning you need to aim the best to be the best.

I would propose two sets of challenges, and you can do either set - one geared towards newer or worse players which they would be able to complete almost regardless of skill level, and one geared towards more experienced players that they will actually enjoy. Things like, get a 10 kill win.. things that are challenging but still allow you to play the f'ing  game.

I just wanted to suggest the possibility of implementing a killcam after you die to see exactly what happened on the enemy's screen. Similar to Call of Duty. 

Some people have brought up that this would bring an unfair advantage towards gameplay, which is understandable. If you are in Squads and someone kills a teammate and then they figure out where someone is via the kill cam, then it becomes unfair. I simply suggest you can only see the killcam after the game once ALL your squad members are dead.

I just would like an easier way to see how I died rather than going through the replay system, finding the enemy that wrecked me, and seeing their gameplay. Only 10-15 seconds of footage that I particularly want to see but the effort to get it takes a couple minutes. 

I just want a discussion on it. What are your thoughts? Should we have it? Should we not?",FortNiteBR

Honestly if i find that person i will punch him so god damn hard. Why the F did you even nerf it? This challenge is not hard it is just cancerous and frustrating as hell. This sounds very harsh but im really angry right now.

So i tried getting this crappy challenge for serveral hours now, but instead of completing it, i am just having a mental breakdown. \(Im crying right now\) I am not the person that rages at video games, i am very calm in general, but this challenge made me throw stuff around my room, shouting and nearly breaking my fcking mouse. For the sake of my laptop i unistalled the epic games launcher, until i come down again. 

I tried it several times \(those are just the matches i find a trap\): First time i get killed, but still knock and kill someone with the trap\-didnt count. Second time, I try to trap someone in a 1x1, but he kills me first. Third time, knock someone, hit him with the trap\-doesnt kill him and he goes off the trap. Fourth time, i want to trap someone, ping goes up to 1100\- i get killed. Fifth time, i try 50v50, knock someone, got killed befor i could trap him. Sixth time, i try to get a loot drop, i open it, get boogied by own teammate and he steals my loot, including a trap.\(i hate you btw\). Seventh time, i fight a person, he is low, lag kicks in\-i am dead. Eight time: i knock someone, place a trap, he just goes off it, i showed him that i wanted him to go into the trap but nah. Nineth time, i knock someone, trap doesnt deal enough damage and his teammate kills me.

Between all those matches were multiple other ones without traps, wich made me rage too. As i am writing this right now, i have calmed down a lil bit, but i wont touch this game so soon.",FortNiteBR

He usually has one or two chests. There’s also a very tall wooden house a bit north of him that has one or two and still counts as wailing woods. 

Snobby kills: try to wait until you hear someone already in a fight, then ambush them (preferably with a shotgun). 

Assault rifle damage: find a scoped assault rifle and hop into 50s. Land behind the other team and then sneak up on them and scope in. 

Treasure map: it’s in moisty, by a large tree on a small island in the water, a bit east from a giant set of green screens (look online for the exact location on the map).

Center of the storm: you must be on the ground, a little purple thing will appear and make noise and if you get close to it itl disappear signaling that you found the center. Honestly it’s just luck. Drop, get settled first, run in if it’s clear and then dip and hide. Wait for the storm to shrink and repeat. Take your time and don’t rush this, it will also get much easier in the later game as the area is much smaller so consider waiting till late game. 

7 ammo crates: land in snobby for tons of ammo crates. The house farthest north and the security rooms by it have like 5 at least. You can also land far back in junkyard and then run through haunted and pleasant but this shouldn’t be too bad. Patience is key!

Trap kill: honestly not nearly as hard as people make it out to be. Go into squads or 50s (people tend to suck more in 50s), find a trap, knock someone down, build a box around them, place the trap on the ceiling.

Secret tier: it’s in the evil bunker behind the rocket ship (near the top of it, you’ll need to build up a bit). ",FortNiteBR

Epic Games, you are funding the competitive scene with 100 million dollars and you can't even solve simple bugs, you fix one bug and you get 10 more, you don't fix anything, the only thing you ever do is nerf after nerf after nerf, and it's enough.

Guns have bloom ALREADY, shotguns don't work sometimes or you deal 9 damage to your opponent, the pattern isn't fixed, it's RANDOM, WHY?!?!

Building is scuffed aswell, you can't place ANYTHING near you, it goes away the whole time, also you build something that is 1 mm in the floor and other times you have builds that are flying? How does this make sense?

Matter of fact, you can't even edit without having a delay, damn, you even nerfed quick material harvesting... Was that really necessary? You nerfed the hell out of everything and you want a competitive scene? You are changing so much stuff it's annoying, fix this game please! 

I can't even find a shotgun after I land, most of the games it takes me atleast 10-15 minutes until I get a shotgun, you loot system is also really poorly distributed

It was so beautiful at the start of the BR mode, I played it a lot before you nerfed all the shotguns, you could build perfectly and your game had no FPS stutters or hitches

Also a recent audio bug is the parachute noise when landing. It sometimes appears way too late, making you think someone else landed with you.

There could be other things in the patch like new audio for some weapons.

Audio is one of the most important aspects in the game so in a game, which has the goal to survive, audio can be the difference between life and death.

Big shield drop (1x) = 50 shield anytime / 50 total value


Slurp Juice drop (1x) = 25 health +  25 shield anytime / 50 total value


Ive always felt like the slurp was a bit underwhelming compared to its lesser healing drops in terms of rarity. With Slurp being an epic drop, i always felt it could be a bit more valuable as well as maybe being an option to carry to fights as opposed to the much widely used small shields. A way i could see this being more balanced would be to have the slurp drops be in stacks of 2, and increase their carry maximum to 4.


 To add to its value it could also be used twice to double the tick effect from 1 health/shield per tick to 2, making it quicker to heal up giving it more value to hold for battle

The stats for these changes would essestislly be :


Slurp Juice drop (2x) 50 health + 50 sheilds anytime / 100 total value

I dislike its potential. It makes no sense to me that such thing is in the game. What's the point of building up to a mountain, when a player can easily get there by jetpacking to it?

I was trying it out yesterday, and i felt like it didn't belong in the game. I easily won the high ground when i had lost it already because of the jetpack. Personally, i like the good ol' intense build battles. I don't want to see someone who got outbuilt to just go up with that thing. 

I've been enjoying fortnite a lot. It's safe to say that it is my favorite game at the moment. I don't want to see it ruined.

Problem And Fix,"I was playing a couple days ago playing and i had me a sweet gold Scar, 999 wood and full shields. I'm out doing my thing then boom im dead. Zero chance to react. Apparently someone sniped me from across the map. I got 1 shot killed. Ok cool. My issue isn't that i got 1 shot killed. The issue is the fact i had FULL shields!

The idea of shields is they provide protection before you get to your main health. But if you snipped in the head while having shields and you still die then it didnt serve its purpose did it? Thus not allowing for any reaction. That part is no fun and unfair.

The solution would be that head shot snips and shotguns to a players head with full shields should eliminate 100&amp;#37; shields then you are down to real health and kill them as normal. If they have say half or 75&amp;#37; it should again take all the shields off and a small portion of the main health. Then proceed to kill them as normal.

Regular guns should function as normal. The issue was only with snipers and shot guns. Does that make sense?

Some would say ""Oh just get good"" or ""its a shooting game"" ect but that has zero to do with what im talking about.

Imagine as soon as you get full shields you immediately get 1 shot killed. If its rare you dont feel the pain as much but what if it happened all the time? Then you would think ""this sucks cause i cant do anything"". In honesty this prob happens every 50 games or so but when it does i always come back to the thought ""what is the purpose of the shields if i just can get head\-shot and not react?"" lol. Thats my 2 cents.

Nevermind the fact that I'm really not that great at the game; I'm fairly average. It's the skin that determines whether you're a ""noob"" or not, which I think is kind of obnoxious. Is there anything wrong with spending however much money you want on skins? No, not a single thing. Spend hundreds if you want. But don't act like buying virtual money for virtual clothes puts you on some pedestal, because it doesn't. Some crazy cool skin does not equate to you being a good player.

Please, let us know what you guys think. Thanks!

Game Modes

Pistol upgrade mode- pistol mode but with every kill upgrades the pistol. Start with common pistol.

Squad mode with designated medic- team members must protect medic, only medic can revive, if medic dies no one can be revived. Alternate is that someone else then can become the medic randomly 

Haunting or soul stealer mode- if someone kills you, your team must avenge your death, if they find certain objects throughout the map they are able to revive one team player. Alternate idea to this is if they want to revive they have to go to haunted hills to charge the life crystal and return to body to bring them back. 

Bomb diffuse mode- everyone gets only bombs, must blow up main fort to win (each team must build a large home base fort) if bomb is diffused , they win
Infected mode- one person is infected and must infect other people, goal is for healthy to defeat infected. If touched by storm you're immediately infected 

Freeze tag mode- hit someone with pick axe and they freeze and if their teammate doesn't hit them to unfreeze them they end up switching to opposite team

Weapon Ideas 

Dummy guns- a gun that you wont know shoot blanks or that displays the ""BANG"" flag 
pick axes only

Pistol or 50 cal revolver with a scope

Electric or ice stun trap 

Shellshock grenade- makes victim move in slow motion for 5 seconds
stun guns- shoots electrical probes in close proximity

Decoy bombs- when activated will simulate gunfire   (or decoy sensors that are activated like a trip wire)

Mystery weapon- spawns a new chest if you find certain plants or items throughout the map (ex- 3 plants will form a seed that will grow a mystery weapon. Must hold onto for a certain amount of time to allow the weapon to grow)

Glue traps- like fly traps- makes you move in slow motion until you walk out of it. Still have access to guns, just cannot walk 

Spy weapons- if you have a weapon that has a tracker on it, drop it and if someone else picks it up you can follow them on the map and track them to kill them. 

Invincible mode- find an item in a chest, airdrop etc, consume and it will make you faster and stronger for 20 seconds *like the Mario star

Squirt gun mode

Antigravity gun- shoot them up high, let them fall to ground and die. victim still able to shoot and must shoot opponent before getting high enough to do damage or die from fall

Mirages or hologram decoy to make it look like someone is walking to defer attention",FortNiteBR

If I try and place a wall, and for whatever reason it try’s and places it a block ahead and I can’t place immediate cover, I die. 


When the biggest part of your fantastic game Dosnt work for a big group of your players there is a problem. Console has come a long way in terms of building but you would rather focus on fixing SUPPLY drops than making changes that matter. How bout instead of investing 100 million on competitive scene, you invest that money on new servers, new engines for building grid, and making your game actually playable for a portion of your players.

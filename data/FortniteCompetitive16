3,mingsphinx,1555125998,bcmfvt,21,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bcmfvt/understanding_epics_decision_on_asian_servers/,0,Understanding Epic's decision on Asian servers,"The kids are screaming that Epic does not care about South East Asia or South Asia or the Middle East and Africa. But the fact that a Singapore server was added in pubs actually proves that the senior management of Epic not only appreciates the problem but also took action to address it.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the players in Asia outside of China are in SEA and SA, but the bulk of the revenue comes from Korea and Japan. It is very much in Epic's interest that the Asian qualifiers for the World Cup come from North East Asia as this will drive player interest in the key lucrative markets. The goal of Epic is to make money, which is why they have distributed slots in the World Cup to reflect their financial interests. For this reason, OCE has been given as many qualifiers as they have because Australia and New Zealand are lucrative markets for Epic even though we all know that there are not that many good players from OCE.

&amp;#x200B;

Another less palatable reason is that Epic wants to make sure the heroes of Fortnite look and talk like the people whose spending on items have made the game such a success. They do not want a situation like in League of Legends of Dota where Asian teams dominate. They want Fortnite to continue to be a game where the 'best' players are from North America and Europe. The reason for doing this is less about race and more about money.

&amp;#x200B;

So stop complaining. Unless you have an idea that will allow Epic to make money from the under served regions stretching from Africa to South East Asia, competing on the Japan server is the best that they can do.",FortniteCompetitive

Seeing that most Pro Players have at least 2 Years Experience in Competitive Gaming, I feel that I have solid potential for 6 Months Experience, I always look to improve, and I keep a daily routine of roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes of raw practice and training, I rewatched all of ESL Katowice and I'm watching pros like Tom72, Ghost Kayuun, Ghost Shah, and Ghost Innocents and trying to implement parts of their playstyle to my game

I don't want to be some Ass that says that they're gonna be the most mechanically skilled and best player in Fortnite, I know that I don't have the Natural Born Talent to take that Position nor do I have the personality, what I do want is to be in the Upper Echelon of Players, someone that has a Good Reputation in this community and the community of whatever game becomes the next big competitive e-sport

My Goal is to get Signed (Preferably to 100Thieves) by the time I turn 19, I want to try and be more involved with the community and provide good information in this sub, I'll also be prowling on this sub a lot more to find more advanced tips

If there are any High Tier Players on this sub, I just want you to know that I'm willing to check out your channels and see your vods to learn a thing or two

I've decided on a Professional Name Already: Phantoon, Inspired by the Boss from Super Metroid

Every other aspect of grouping pc players and console players using mouse and keyboard is also just as ridiculous, there is no reason to do it and I can’t believe there hasn’t been a bigger outrage to it happening.

There's been near zero transparency in what is preventing them from making the changes we're all so desperately craving. I don't know about you guys, but if Epic said ""We're aware of ""ghost shots"" and are working on a fix, but we're currently unable to employ said fix for X reason"", I wouldn't complain as much as I do. They would at least let us know that they have acknowledged the problem and aren't just ignoring us, which at least for me would be adequate.

The competitive community manager's job should be to the middle man between Epic and the competitive community, holding polls and getting a sense of which direction the community wants the game to go, then relay this information to the devs. Obviously I'm not suggesting that every time a poll is held the devs should make a change, but at least someone would be able to confirm that the devs have received said information. The devs could then give a response to the CCM that he/she can make a post about and let everyone know the outcome of. 

Fortnite has the potential to be the greatest e-sport of all time, even with the whole RNG component to it. Everyone who complains about the game simply cares about it and wants the best for it - myself included. There's no other game that can come close to Fortnite in terms of skill ceiling and its mechanical skill component, and chances are there might never be another game like this. That is why Epic needs to take this matter seriously before it's too late. People are leaving in protest, and once the pros do, they'll take their audience with them. A community manager won't prevent this exactly, but could mend the situation and give Epic back the communication they used to have in the early days.",FortniteCompetitive

I was in contender for STL, I had 49 points in the Luxe Semis, 89 in first session of gauntlet duos, and I had a 26 point pop up in January. These are not meant to be flexes (I’m not a top-tier comp player by any means, and these scores are nothing special), they’re just meant to hopefully paint a picture of my skill. 

I am really really struggling with what to do in Arena. I have been floating in the 270-290 range of points for several days. The last time I won a game was at 250 points. What frustrates me is how players who I know I am way better than are getting into champs thanks to the hamster ball fiasco. 

If I try to play the game normally, I get W-keyed midgame or I die off spawn with a drop contested by several people. If I try to sit in a ball, I’m never able to get one, because everyone and their mother goes for them and very few spawn. 

I just played 6 solos and wasn’t able to break even on any of them (including an agonizing top 26) and am down to 273. 

I am frustrated more than I can explain; with that, on top of the issues in the game, I am really struggling to not give up completely. I have been grinding for the World Cup since the first announcement. I’m not going to make it to NYC but I just want to compete. But I’m losing it.

\- Fortnite removing siphon from the public playlist

\- Fortnite removing stretched

\- Adding Ballers 

etc etc

&amp;#x200B;

But can we be REAL for a second... This changes are actually AMAZING for the game and the only logical things to add in the game 

&amp;#x200B;

1 ) Siphon is ONLY GOOD FOR SWEATS and watching Twitch Streamers... NOT FOR CASUALS (like me) when they playing!!!!!! especially a casual playlist like pubs. 1% of the fortnite player base already gets majority of the kills and wins;

 with siphon in pubs, it incentives TTV sweats to rack up as many 30 kill games as possible. Pubs should be one of the first places a casual player (6 hours a week) or noob goes to play and if the game gets too hard because all the best players are there, then the GAME WILL DIE because theres no casual user base that will maintain 100 person filled lobbies and buy skins every week. Smurfing is usually frowned upon but somehow in fortnite, we as the community are mad that we dont have game settings that allow a TTV player to average 40 kills a game lol 

&amp;#x200B;

Solution? - Epic most likely will add a siphon mode, but is probably using this time to gather data on new and casual player retention when playing

&amp;#x200B;

2) Fortnite removing stretch was an almost OBVIOUS move that was going to happen. How is it fair that a PC sweaty has even more of an advantage because they have a greater FOV then console players which makes up most of the games player base. They already banned it at different tournaments so its an obvious move to increase competitive integrity between platforms. Its already hard enough to build a reliable spectator client so implementing this before World Cup will Make a GREATER viewer experience.

Fortnite makes Weekly changes in the game to BRING CAUSALS back into the game to try that wacky thing they saw on instagram or twitter. Changes need to happen Weekly and cant stop just because they want to give out money to grow a competitive scene

&amp;#x200B;

3) Ballers are in the game because Epic needs to add in new weapons and vehicles that ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE !!! They do tweak them based on their effectiveness, BUT an average viewer seeing 20 balls endgame doesnt make it look anyless exciting for them ESPECIALLY when the spectator client can rotate between players during the end game. Having IMPACTING new items constantly being introduced in the game is why fortnites been able to maintain a PLAYER BASE and why games like APEX and BLACKOUT mode for Cod are steps behind. No New items or cool updates means games like Apex get boring to play and Boring to watch.  


Overall lets give CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM with the things in the game we dislike and not COMPLAIN and be whiny. Theres nothing more embarrassing for the competitive scene then to watch a Twitch streamer cry and complain and doodoo on the changes fortnite is making... meanwhile fortnite by staying fresh and making changes that BRING the causuals BACK has  provided an opportunity where people are competing for THOUSANDS of DOLLARS almost on a monthly basis.

If that was their plan all along, then why did they allow it at secret skirmish, say it would be allowed at WC, and spend a lot of time developing a spectator feature? It makes no sense

Rather, I think that the only reason this happened is because huge streamers like ninja, usually known for being content creators, started playing stretched.

Now I can’t say for sure why this would be a problem for epic but I have two theories:
It would be bad for revenue and might drive casuals away from streams/Fortnite in general. If little Timmy’s game looks a lot different than Ninja’s, there is less of a mentality of “hey I could be the next Ninja,” which could hurt the player base.

Or, the other option is that someone high up in Epic(maybe someone like the VP) tuned into Ninja’s stream and saw that he was playing stretched and made the decision that they didn’t like how it looked. Now this may seem far fetched at first glance, but if [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/zayt/status/1113531135894728704) represents the competitive team at fortnite, then I can’t even begin to fathom what the casual side looks like.",FortniteCompetitive

I recognize that you can’t eliminate RNG completely. But you could definitely minimize it.

Some ideas:

1. Every chest spawns
2. Remove common and uncommon weapons 
3. Reduce item pool

When I first started my desk-job, I was very excited to have the opportunity to learn to type exceptionally well. I was already a decent typist but I really wanted to get to triple digits... to be able to say I could type 100+ words per minute. After I started working, I was surprised to discover that many people around me had been working on computers 10+ years and were only typing 20-40 words per minute.

 

Now, why is that? We are constantly told that the key to improvement is practice. If that is true, why have these people around me who have spent literally tens of thousands of hours typing, have the same speed they’ve had for years?

 

The answer is that repetition and time is not enough. In order to improve, you need to focus on improving. Your time spent needs to be deliberate if you want to learn. There's a plateau that people hit once they are comfortable. For the average typist in an office, that plateau is probably around 35-40 wpm. Most people don’t care to spend brain power on increasing, and that’s fine. Similarly, you will hit a plateau in any competitive game and you will not improve without working on it.

 

Learning how to practice is an invaluable skill for anyone that wants to compete. Most of you here have chosen an extremely difficult game. Because of that, there is so much to explore and it can be extremely rewarding, but how often do we see the famous die -&gt; rage -&gt; re-queue combo? I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, but I will say it’s not probably not conducive to a positive learning experience. Every loss should be thought of as a learning experience. The value of time spent reviewing, reflecting, and examining alternate paths cannot be overstated.

 

Last thing I want to say is that losses need to be your best friend. These are your opportunities to spot specific holes in your game. That’s what we’re working toward, right? We need specific and deliberate tasks to work on. I’m a big believer that more is learned through losses and the wins are only there to keep you motivated throughout the process.

 

“The difference between a master and a beginner is the master has failed more times than the beginner has attempted”

 

Hope this helps, wish you luck =) 

 

TLDR; If you want to get better, you need to be deliberate and honest in reflection.  Spend your time efficiently by focusing on specific areas to improve",FortniteCompetitive

It is actually insane to witness what is happening right now.  There are so many bugs, glitches, and performance issues right now it would be borderline impossible to hot fox all of the issues within 24 hours.  Any company that isnt Fyre would see the writing on the wall and postpone the qualifiers and push back the World Cup.

I am not sure why Epic is not yet created a competitive branch in their code base.  This is something that should have done the second they started talking about the World Cup.  Its really silly that was not done back when they begun shooting around the idea of having a massive esports tournaments.  Its outright brain dead stupidity that it has still not happened.  If they would have done this and they still need to do it ASAP they would have a lot more control over the changes going into the competitive branch and therefore making the competitive branch far more stable.  The more i think about this the more dumbfounded i am that there is not a competitive branch in their code base.  A company should never be pushing out rushed code as well as code that has not fully gone through a test cycle but if for some reason that is the way you want to run your game you should at least have a different competitive branch that is separate and shielded from these changes.

Epic, having a separate code base for competitive play is not a hard thing to do and this should be your number one priority.  You can not deny that you have a history of introducing more bugs than are fixed.  If you insist on continue with the update schedule that you have had in place this competitive branch is 100% necessary for the integrity of the competitive scene.  

Epic, you have a chance to create a lasting tournament esports series.  You stumbled into the one of the biggest games of all time.  I understand that the speed in which Fortnite blew up was overwhelming and the call of a competitive scene also came quickly.  If you settle down and gather yourselves you can fix this properly.  Im surprised that the existing management in the company did not go through the proper steps to ensure the integrity of the competitive side.  It shows a clear lack of knowledge within the existing team in this department.  Something needs to change there.  My guess is you have some really big egos who are naturally very stubborn.  The more complaints they hear the more they dig their feet.  This is clearly not the way to react and will prove to be detrimental to the entire game if it continues.

Again, Epic, you need to create a competitive branch and you need to do it ASAP.  You can not be playing tournaments off the main code branch where changes are pushed up once or twice a week.  The entire competitive community is begging you to learn from your mistakes.  Do not throw away the last remaining bit of integrity you have.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic Games does not care about the competitive players. You are not their money maker. The young kids, new players, and casuals are the key to Epics success. Epic is a business above all, A very successful one at that. They don’t care about your feelings. 

Fortnite is in its worst state for competitive players, but for a 7 year old who gets to play for an hour or two a day, it’s extremely fun. You guys can complain all you want, at the end of the day Epic Games is about making money. 

Before these business moguls come on this thread talking theories that epic is going to kill the game...they’ll never “kill”  the game.  They will do the bare minimum to please everybody, even the competitive players before they let the game die. (Refer back to when Apex first released)

Health and shield per kill was great. When a new player gets on the game, how is he ever going to enjoy the game when the good players never die? I died the other day to some kid with a shotgun end game and lost because I only had 30 heath and literally 0 materials after fighting off the previous squad. He’s obviously not better than me, but he got a win. Now he’s obligated to play more. This is exactly what epic wants. They want it fun for everybody. 

If you don’t start taking this game for what it is (a joke) then you’re going to really start hating it. This game was never intended to be competitive. When players realize that, you’ll be much happier and you’ll enjoy the game more. If you want to play a competitive game, Fortnite is not for you. Aside from the excess bullshit items they add, the ridiculous vehicles, the gunplay being horrible, shots don’t register, you can’t win early game without a pump (if the player is good), the list goes on. There’s too many random factors that determine your chance of survival in this game. Unless you’re in the top 1% of players that are absolutely brilliant and can win with no matter what is handed to them, you’ll never be satisfied. 

All I’m trying to say is the hopes and dreams of this competitive Fortnite is not going to happen. Don’t get worked up about it. There will be a better game in the future that supports a big skill gap. This game has built its success on everybody being happy.

A good nerf to ballers would be to the exit delay, if you exit a baller you should get a delay before shooting that's identical to the pump switch delay, the baller should also make a louder sound when a player leaves it

one last nerf would be that all ballers get insta popped once moving zones start, so that players can use ballers to get to endgame, but they can't use them to avoid turtling/tunneling and using mats

I definitely had less ballers late game after the hot fix but in my opinion nobody should be rolling around in vehicles in late game circles.

If they just left it at Ranked mode, fun game honestly. When you add money on the line and all the dumb things this game has, you now have a failed game that wont be ever considered a serious esport. 

Pretty sure other communities would be furious to even hear how Epic treat the competitive scene let alone actually execute half the things they do. 

They need to make their mind up.

Casual - do you want the game to be fun and focused around using wacky items in every game, going for your first milestone or completing challenges everyday. 

Competitive - do you want a game that makes sense in the competitive scene, a game that showcases SKILL in as much aspects of the game as possible. RNG isnt the best but the best of the best can work around this to an extent.

Right now, hamster balls are the meta. They offer more or less free placement and free rotation, as well as free shield. That alone is a dumb reason to qualify, you literally have people in top placement for them owning a ball and playing low ground while everyone wastes their mats and they dont. 

You have a badly performing game, in this meta. Although performance updates happen(so they say) this game underperforms late game. They should have bt now figured a solution to keep a somewhat consistent experience throughout. Microstutters are fun too right?

Epic made a masterpiece by accident. This game was meant to just be STW, but battle royal took the gaming scene. The problem with this game is Epic. They are indecisive. Firstly they wanna have integrity for all competitive players, not perform game changing updates before tournaments, have in general MORE communication with the competitive scene. But now we have a game more or less driven by a casual audience(which is fine) but isnt fine when you consider it also drives competitive. We dont want broken shit in a competitive environment. 

Epic shouldnt be marketing the game with new items. They should be marketing the game using competitive gameplay alone to promote how intense and how fun the game truly can be. Most of us that achieve a 20-30 man late game should be able to look past any performance issues and still say they find those rotations fun. I do to this day i get excited and happy that im doing well and im part of a madness. Epic just need to find the right sauce to add at the right time. We dont need new weapons, new vehicles, new items in general. We need vaults, we need performance updates, we need the right game for one of, if not, the biggest prize pool in esport history.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently on the cusp of 300 points in Arena, played almost exclusively duos, to start 30%-45% of the games are a solo v duo's because my buds early game is not strong. He's admitted and I'd say that 70% of the points received have been mine. I don't want to upset him, I don't want to belittle him, but I don't see how to approach the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

He is a solid player, totally above average, but that being said an average game is me sitting with 5 to 10 kills and he has 0. He downs every final circle trying to kill the last guy. I mean I have never met someone else who has the ability to get 1 pumped every time. Couple games ago he literally killed both of us. Couple kills, tons of materials. we have high ground, and somehow in a panic decides to break the floor we are both shooting down from, I don't mean, woops I shot the floor. I mean was like, ""we should push!"" \*pickaxes the floor out from under us\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I love playing with him, but I'm sick of carrying, I need someone my skill level, but how do I tell him that without pissing him off. He knows I'm better and I can tell it bothers him so that doesn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

(Side note, He was genuinely 10x better than me a month ago, I had taken a break from Fortnite for 2 months until competitive and tourney's really started to take form. He finally convinced me to 1v1. I hated it. He destroyed me every single time. I couldn't edit well, my building was weak. I had always been a better gun skill player, but his builds were beyond mine. So I sat down, and let him teach me everything he knew about building. Great news is I have implemented it into my game play and now can play late game comp, easily. Now when we 1v1, score is about 20 to 3 in my favor before we are both ""warm"").

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : Having to carry my Arena duo who is a close friend, sick of playing with an above average player with great game knowledge who consistently can't use what he knows, and makes mistakes. No clue how not to offend someone who taught me everything I know about building because I surpassed him.

&amp;#x200B;

Don’t get me wrong as a console player I have a few gripes about certain adjustments that could be enabled but obviously we don’t need to even the playing field tremendously considering builder pro and the custom sensitivities etc. However the scroll wheel in the first instance is just terrible.

Then you get a game where ‘casuals’ can play the fun game of Fortnite with all the stuff like ballers and season related events and there is a mode just for the competitive players. In this mode people can play ‘seriously’ and stuff like ballers are not in it. The map won’t change as much as in the normal mode and items only get added when balanced in the normal pubs. In that way the both groups, which are both important to the wellbeing of Epic Games and therefore Fortnite, are both happy. Maybe add ‘competitive pubs’ to that mode so people can practice without losing or winning points and can play ‘casually’ or try out tactics in a competitive setting? 

Of course, Epic could bring up the argument that in streaming only the competitive side of the game will be shown, but I guess we could all agree that normal pubs are fun from time to time and will therefore still be shown on streams?

Recently upgraded to a RTX 2060, so that plus my Ryxen 2600X and 16GB of 3200mHz RAM, I’ve got a pretty powerful rig. 

So it was a pretty dope surprise when I got back on the arena grind and found my game had a lot of microstutters, especially when enemies were on screen or a lot of stuff was happening at once. Really only happened on Fortnite too. Which is a problem because I was in the money on warmup and plan on going hard through World Cup.

After fucking with my BIOS and changing every setting I could possibly think of, I decided to default my BIOS, disable my OC, and run with as stock of a setup as I could. Game runs like butter now. I’m in late game circles with 30+ alive with nothing more than the expected slight fps drop because of so much building. 

#TL;DR - After experimenting a bit it looks like disabling XMP (Extreme Memory Profile, basically an ez RAM overclock built into some Ryzen motherboards), which dropped my RAM clock speeds to 2400 instead of 3200, fixed all my micro stutter issues. 

P.S. - This could be a very specific issue with my specific build. But I’m using pretty common parts, and pretty new, high quality shit too. So if you’re having input/micro stutter issues with a Ryzen system try this, otherwise no clue if this will help you.",FortniteCompetitive

This has protected Epic in so many ways, and Fortnite would be a different game now if there was never a SAC program.

I come from the Destiny community, and at many times in the first game's life, large creators in the community encouraged their fans to not support the game's microtransactions (Silver currency - implemented later in the game's lifespan). Many PvP creators specifically had problems with Bungie's disregard for PvP when it came to balancing/bug fixes.

Here's the genius part:

Why would a large creator speak out against Epic, telling people to not buy skins? Large creators do not want to miss out on that check. This is why you can go on Twitter to find multiple large creators/pros bashing the game and saying they do not want to play... yet every time Fortnite tweets out an item shop announcement, they quote the tweet with ""use code X."" 

The SAC program was genius; the level of free advertising from creators and financial security Epic gets is crazy. Creators and pros are, in a sense, shareholders. If kids are buying skins, creators are seeing a nice check. There are many creators who do not play the game at all anymore but still plug their code for skins. 

Some people may tell you otherwise (and they are WRONG), but the best way to get any business ever to change their ways is through their pockets. Anyone with big business or corporate experience will tell you, these companies keep track of revenue like a hawk stalks its prey.

If Epic had never implemented the SAC program, many pros and creators would have told you for some time now to not give Epic a dime. Epic would have paid better attention to improving the game.

In the end, DO NOT PURCHASE SKINS. I wish every pro and creator out there would tell you the same thing, but they have an income stream to defend, no matter how bad the game gets.",FortniteCompetitive

404,EmptyPoet,1554864253,bbgwvy,25,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bbgwvy/the_ballers_wont_be_removed_because_of_performance/,9,"The Ballers won’t be removed, because of performance","We all know how good the Ballers are end game. Free protection and mobility. If you have a Baller you don’t need to waste mats, IE, no building. This is important. 

I think EPIC knew how the ballers were going to be used once we realized how good they are end-game. In fact, I think that’s why they added them.

We all also know about the various performance problems. EPIC knows about them too and I bet they are hard at work trying to optimize and solve the various issues. 

I would like to make an educated guess and claim that they can’t figure out how to optimize end-game much more, at least not right now. I would also say that nobody should blame them for this, they are not dealing with trivial problems. I would even go so far as to commend them for making the game run as smoothly as it does.

Building is what makes Fortnite truly unique, but building is also problematic from a performance point of view. Not the building itself per se, but the rapid non-ending building that occurs everywhere at the same time. Not only that, but the constant breaking of builds and the common hard problems with just dealing with a lot of players in a small area. I’m mainly talking about end-game here but the principle is essentially the same everywhere.

The issue is that the server needs to keep track of *everything - all the time*. Players have learned to build extremely fast, you all know how fast you can burn through your mats by overbuilding. There can be hundreds, probably even *thousands* of pieces being built at the same time. The server needs to keep track of all of these and update them until they are completed. (While the server needs to keep track of completed builds too, I suspect they can mark them as static or something until they are hit or a connected piece is destroyed. That’s why I mentioned breaking of builds too, that probably triggers all these extra checks).

The intensity of end-game also demands that everything is registered and processed almost instantly, even the fraction of a second can be the difference between living and dying, winning or loosing. Nothing or a large sum of money. Everything *needs* to be processed fast.

What doesn’t go fast is doing too much, and every single build piece is one thing more the server needs to process. When 10, 20 or 40 people blows through hundreds of builds every few seconds, the numbers adds up. When the number are up, performance goes down. There is literally nothing EPIC can do about that, that’s simply the reality. It doesn’t matter if they hire 1,000 devs, it won’t change the core problem.

So they added the Baller. Every player in one of those bad boys is one less player building. One less builder is potentially, and most often also the reality, hundreds of build pieces less to worry about. When there are 3, 5 or 10 players in Ballers, the number add up. Or rather, the numbers go down and performance goes up. By the time the Ballers gets targeted, enough players have been eliminated for the server to handle those players start burning through their mats.

Now, they have admitted they are too OP when you’re also invulnerable inside them, but even with player damage I think they will achieve their goal. After all, an eliminated driver doesn’t build either.

Anyway, if this is the case, they won’t remove them. At least not unless they add something worse. Think about it, yeah, it’s a free pass to end-game, but it’s far better than some previous additions. The Ballers might be dumb but they don’t hurt you (anymore). 

Thinking about this also made me think about everything EPIC seems to be doing to combat building (splodes, planes, structural damage, deagle, infinity blade). I now suspect they do it to simply increase performance by cleaning up. Not to cater to bots and punish those who build, but simply to reduce the number of builds.

I also came up with another solution; let the players do it for you. Help us help you. Give us an incentive to destroy builds, let us farm by destroying other people’s builds. I don’t know, it could work.

TL;DR: I suspect the Ballers are being used as intended by EPIC. Players in Ballers is less players building and less building is less work for the server and less work for the server is better performance. 

Conclusion: Ballers=Performance.",FortniteCompetitive

Remember how you used to only get points for 3, 5, and 7 eliminations? This changed how players played when they were one elimination shy of their next elimination point or when they already had 7 eliminations. Now that each elimination is incentivized, we don't see players pressed for an extra elimination to make their previous eliminations worth something, and we also don't see players going completely defensive because they'd already accumulated a maximum number of elimination points.

I've been messing around with this idea, and it goes something like this: *Each placement advancement* grants point(s) just like each eliminations. Of course, this would mean the point system would change drastically and would result in very different numbers, but it gets rid of those choke points in the game where players are trying to get into *top X* for points.

So what might this look like? I don't know. It would require quite a bit of thought and testing, but here's a rough sketch:

\+0.2 for placing 99, 98, 97...90, then +0.3 for 89-80, +0.4 for 79-70, +0.5 for 69-60, +0.6 for 59-50. After that, placement becomes more difficult and should be rewarded more. +0.9 for placing 59-50, 1.1 for placing 49-40, 1.5 for placing 39-30, 2 for placing 29-20, 2.4 for placing 19-15, 3 for placing 15-10, 4 for placing 10-5, 8 for placing 4, 12 for placing 3, 18 for placing 2, 25 for placing 1.

Again, just a rough sketch. If my calculations are correct, that's 189 points for a 0 elimination victory royale. Each elimination could be 20 points. You could even make the base elimination value something like 5 points and then gradually increase that as the lobby gets smaller to provide less incentive for sabotaging early games.

My overall point is that players shouldn't have to be consciously thinking about the point system in a way that changes how the game is supposed to be played. If you get rid of these cut-offs that create choke points during the game, players don't have to worry about those sorts of things and will just play the game *knowing that they're getting rewarded for each individual placement and elimination*, rather than just making sure they reach top X for all their hard work getting there.

**These numbers might look ugly, but that's just because you're used to playing a format that requires you to actively keep track of your placement. When you don't have to pay attention to it, it's just a number.**",FortniteCompetitive

I would love to marry TSM_ZexRow and carry his Asian babies because his toxicity is actually funny.  It's so much better to watch a toxic streamer instead of some uppity and giddy streamer like ByArteer.  Calling kids dogshit when you lose is hilarious and so much better than saying good game or ""I should have done x or y"" or saying excuses.  Streamers that are toxic are just so much more real than those that act nice just for donations.  However I do not like complaining or whining or crying.  That is not even toxic it's just annoying to hear you whine and complain all stream, innocents and WingsofRedemption.",FortniteCompetitive

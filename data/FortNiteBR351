A little bit of background, although Fortnite was not my first ""shooter"" ( Overwatch being the first ever ) I still sucked a lot when I first started a month ago. Before I played Fortnite I played a lot of League and got Diamond on the previous season. The building dynamics in this game was really hard me to get used to, but I eventually overcame that.


Now I'm not a professional build war John Wick who'll use 500 mats each fight, but yesterday I came extremely close in a Duos match to winning, although I played pretty well along with my friend, bringing in 12 kills ( 18 totaled with my friend ) we had a minute long build battle and lost.


Today, on my very first game after work I actually won my first game, after almost 250 games! As I said, I know many of you better players wouldn't care but I'm really glad I could get that seasonal umbrella before the season ended, and I can see improvement from a month ago. From having no clue what the storm was my first game, to racking 4.56 kills average my past 25 games, I'm pretty proud. ",FortNiteBR

Look at this beautiful piece of modern digital artwork.  Bask in the glory that you mortals mistakenly passed over while chasing Shield Potions and Golden Scars.

You see it?  Do you see that glorious, orange glow from the muzzle flash of that weapon being fired at some poor sap across the way?  You can see it all over Mr. John Builds-a-Lot Wick's face.  Not only that, you can see it ON THE GUN ITSELF.  And sweet baby meteor, it looks **GOOD**.

Now look at the gun.  A Hand Cannon, legendary rarity, found in a chest just off of Loot Lake.  Such a fine weapon, put to great use by a man known for only two things- building, and killing.  You have probably seen this piece many times before, and though ""Eh, I'll take something else instead.""  WELL NOT TODAY, BUCKAROO.  Look at it.  Now, look at it *more*.  Do you see what I see?  That nob, right where the barrel should be, exposed just for a brief second as hot lead hurls towards a no-skin's annoying existence.  You see it?  That, good reader, is the bolt, something you only see very shortly after dispensing several thousand foot-pounds of pure justice towards the wicked.  AND EPIC PUT IT THERE.

What I'm trying to say is, Epic has put an underappreciated amount of work into making sure that the weapons in this game look as real as possible.  And, if I must say so myself, these weapons look *dang fine* to me.",FortNiteBR

Seriously, why is a legendary heavy shotgun so bad?  If you say you dont agree, then please explain this clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpeedyLivelyJamDBstyle

She shoots him point blank in the head with a blue pump shotgun, and he isnt moving. Only does 95 damage, this is just a small example.

How come even I can sometimes kill people through walls? Its not fair to the other player, and I dont feel good killing someone that way.

It my opinion, when I win, someone in that match probably got screwd over royally by the netcode and inconsistency of damage in this game.

- No destructible environment (If you hide behind a tree it cant be destroyed by gun fire)
- More Pre placed Pre built cover to make the open areas usuable.
- More ammo in ammo drops(floor and ammo chest) and more to start when you pick up a gun
- Would also be fun in 50 v 50.

3. Black Knight \(Fuck I grinded hard to get this, totally worth it\)
4. Circuit Breaker \(When it first came out was the coolest skin so far\)
5. Wu Kong \(only on the list because of the back bling\)

Honorable mention\-

Amazon prime skins \(I like them both, cut Camo Raptor is awesome\)

Rust Lord \(Wish this wasn't ruined by the memes though\)

Dark Voyager \(Would be top 5, but using this skin is a death sentence, might as well have a red outline like you are spotted in a Battlefield game\)

Most regretable purchase\-

Raven \(Too common, back bling is cool, but I plan on refunding this and buying a legendary S4 skin instead\(if i like one that is\)\)

Best Dance\-

- The meteor will be hitting Dusty Depot, and NOT Tilted Towers as so many believe. Epic has thought this area of the map has needed an update for a long time.
- The map will always be evolving. The map will be updated WEEKLY in Season 4. Epic feels like they had a wasted opportunity with Tilted Towers going up all at once. They would rather have had bulldozers &amp; a few raising cranes one week, then one building go up the next week, two buildings the following week, etc.
- Moisty Mire will be gone by the end of Season 4.
- The Season 4 Battle Pass is all Supehero-themed. There will be superhero skins and villain skins (at least 2 of each). They aren't from Marvel or DC, just Epic's own characters.

My family problems got worse and worse through the months with my aunt and uncle not accepting me for who I am and a big part of my mom's family shutting us out of their life and I just looked to BR to help me (and STW). It also brought me closer to my real friends. We all were able to play a game we all loved and had fun. It made me forget about the problems with people at school, and problems with my family.

1- Makes it too easy to land your shots. Literally people land all their shots. Specially headshots with shotguns are too common in console.

2- Aim assist makes your aim to lock on the enemy, therefore making it slow to move when you are aiming at enemy and makes it hard to shoot where you want to shoot. For example I wanna shoot someone in the head. We are in a shotgun fight and if you are a console player you know that a lot of people do a small tap on their joy stick to move the camera. I wanna move my aim to the head but as soon as my aim goes to the enemy's body it slows down therefore not hitting the head.

Most of the games that I play on console doesn't have ail assist on shotguns and probably Gears of War is a good example. Shotgun feels great in that game. It moves pretty smoothly and doesn't stick to enemies making it easy to use when you are in a fight with multiple people and in overall easy to shoot where ever you wanna shoot it. Right now shotguns are pretty unfair on consoles and in my opinion it has made the game less enjoyable.",FortNiteBR

Epic, either give us the refund system back or give an ETA of when it comes back. I feel like you are repeating what you did with the Jetpack and the Guided Missile- claiming there is a bug and never talking about it again. At least be honest and tell us if it’s removed.

These are both DC characters, therefore I think that each of the 5 parts will be a skin released everyday until April 30th, ( April 28th, April 29th, April 30th ). The remaining three characters will be something around the likes of Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, which would be the most likely, could also be CatWoman, Aquaman ETC.  

EDIT 1: As stated by u/Cuboid_ , in the past two battlepasses there were more than two sets of skins, in season 2 we had the knights and the disco set, in season 3 the space explorers, the rust lord set, the elite agent set, and the set for john wick. So therefore there may be more than 5 skins, and more sets that aren't superheros so aren't just limited to superheros this season.

Financial crisis , National debt crisis , studio close , bankrupt , job loss , house loss , people reduce spending , low profit , … From H U Y N H P H U D A T A S- 023750260 - Vietnam to every game studio around the world , game publisher , to every comic studio , comic publisher , film studio , … intend to find The Light of Financial in the Dark Age of Financial Crisis , the Hope of your Studio , your Company .

The purpose when I create this character are showing all game studio around the world 1 potential character which can become a main character of a new 3rd action game , can beat the profit of God of war , Devil may cry ,….

When your game profit low , you should compare potentiality of this character and all kind of character from God of War , Devil may cry , ….. , all kind of character from comic , movie and any other character from entertainment industry .

When your game profit low , you should compare the potential profit of a 3rd action game base on this character and the potential profit of the game project you are working , which one bigger ,  **IN NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS , FINANCIAL CRISIS , CUSTOMERS WILL ONLY BUY A THING THEY REALLY REALLY LIKE , IF YOUR GAME SUBJECT IS JUST NORMAL , NOTHING REALLY ESPECIAL THAN MANY OTHER SAME TYPE GAME , WILL THEY BUY IT**

When your game profit low , you should compare the Universe Creation skill when my character use it for … repairing his whacks - this skill can use to eliminate all the enemy , compare that skill with Poseidon rage , Zeus bolt , Medusa head , Titan rage ,…. , or any special skill you know to realize that Universe Creation skill is a especial kill .

Fan of God of war , Devil may cry , … will they like this character at first sight when they see this hero on the disk cover ?

IF YOU'RE GAMER , WHICH GAME WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY ?
DO YOU SEE THE POTENTIALITY OF THIS CHARACTER ?
In Financial crisis , National debt crisis , if you find something good for your studio game , you should show them that thing , because if your studio game invest new game about this character , they will have good profit , and you will not worry about your job . AND ALL I WANT IS A JOB , IF YOUR STUDIO GAME CAN GIVE ME A JOB , WE WILL COOPERATION .

I introduce you to my Angel , Nathaniel Angel .

On the chest , he have the symbol that we know when we go to school , Infinity symbol . My Angel has a couple of swords :His swords contain 10 elements : Fire , Ice , Thunder , Soil - Earth Control , Dead or Living Creature control , Water , Air , Poison , Metal , Plant control . On the center symbol of the sword , I call that is a Control symbol . Also sometimes symbol of power. Angel also have belt of champions . He also have skull of Satan , or envoy skull of all type evils Nathaniel angel break the horns of Satan , cut the skull in 4 pieces

When we draw this character on paper , we can decrease all the symbol on the belt except the Time symbol because this is Time control ability of this character . This character have 2 swords , and swords contain control power ability of many elements of this character . This character have 2 fighting styles : with or without swords .

When he don’t use swords , he can fight just like a Superman or Thor . When he fight without swords , he can fight by his muscle strength and a power control Time . He can create a shield energy protect people . The main difference between this superhero and many others superhero is Gene and Key of Life symbol . He can use Gene symbol to heal injury people , with Key of Life symbol , he can go to hell , find the souls of some people and find the dead body of them , then use Key of Life combine the dead body and their souls , bring them back to life . When he fight without swords , his fingers can fire white energy beams at the enemies .

When he fights with swords , there is a rule for him : every day with 24 hours , he can use 2 or 3 abilities only for attacking the enemies , example if he choose Time control ability then he can only use more power abilities like Fire or Thunder when he use Swords . From 12h pm of today to 12h pm of next day , Abilities control reset .

When we draw this character on the paper , belong to the space you draw on the paper , belong to you draw the upper body part or lower body this character , belong to you draw the back , the front , the left or right of this character , you can decrease the symbols of you have to draw ,

This character contain a lot of symbols , and he can pull 2 symbols of his palms and put into the palms of the people he allow to use the power of the symbol , and he can allow some people use his weapons when he don’t use his power except his couple of swords . You will see all of his weapon when you watch vid .

Who are the enemies of this character , son of Satan and the soul of Satan the first , when this character kill Satan the first , his soul really like the shape of body of Anubis , Orochi so he become that evil , so the enemies of this character will have all the most famous evil of human kind .

I design this Angel , I can't create a comic serries base on this character because my drawing technique is not good enought to create whole serries , so I hope I can find a comic artist or a comic publisher really interesting about this character and I can cooperate with you to create a serries comic about this Angel .

When he use his strengh and 2 or 3 magic power for 1 day , he just like a normal superhero .

His sword of Judgement have 3 version , C version is for comic .

If I can find a comic artist or a comic publisher really interesting about this character , I will star a Kickstarter project

REALLY ESPECIAL THING :If game about this character release , the best day to do it is Christmas day . Why , because we go to church at night ( night time ) , we release the game at morning time , it's meant angel come first to protect Son of God . 1 REALLY ESPECIAL THING : Many people will almost think about God , but I - Author and Owner say that , just Nathaniel Angel

My Nathaniel Angel at least can can fight more amazing than God of War. He can hold and throw his weapons by a couple of snake skin . Do you remember that in Holy Bible , sometime , Satan become a snake ? But he can do more then that .

1 ESPECIAL THINGS : The Cross Alpha Omega , the meaning you can see in many Church paraffin , it's meant GOD .

** ALL I WANT IS A JOB , THIS CHARACTER IS MY HOPE , AND WILL BECOME YOUR HOPE IF YOUR GAME STUDIO CAN GIVE ME A JOB , but that's not all .**

The whole US and EU like Superhero , and with Infinity symbol on his chest , he is a Superhero , compare my character with DC , Marvel Superheroes , you will understand , and compare with all kind main character of Entertainment Industry like Movie , Game , Comic , ..... which one have more beauty ?

3 Sword , not 2 Sword , the Game screen will become really look like ..... JUDGEMENT DAY .... , this is JUST NATHANIEL ANGEL , IF HE CAN DO IT , BECAUSE GOD ALLOW HIM TO DO IT .... That's all I want to say .

I don't design this character for fun , I design it for a purpose that some game studio will pay attention on this character , and intend to create game about him , a 3rd game action , and I can have a job . batman , Superman , X men , K r a t o s , ...... , Super S a i y a n , G u n d a m . All kind of character from Game Industry , Movie Industry , Comic Industry , no kind of character can compare with my Angel ....How many people watch my post , can you tell me how many masterpiece like this character that you see in your life ?

Do you know what I good at , good at IDEAS , my friend ...
On You tube they said : ""its a super﻿ jesus with double egg whisk masterpiece "" , another people said , not me ^ ^ ... , so we should call masterpiece

1 more : Where can I buy this﻿ game? , the main point to make a studio have good profit is this . **ALL I WANT IS A JOB , THIS CHARACTER IS MY HOPE , AND WILL BECOME YOUR HOPE**",FortNiteBR

A lot of the hints and Easter eggs added into the game over the last week or so have taken cues from the film 'Independence Day' for example the signs on the roof, the signal/message on the TV's \(to co\-ordinate their attack\), maps on tables etc.

The other thing is that Lucky Landing was not added into the map until part way through last season to commemorate the Chinese New Year. The next event that I can think of is Americas Independence Day on 4th July so it would make sense for this to tie in. Also the name Lucky Landing bears no reference on what is currently there, the seasonal Chinese themed buildings, but what if the Aliens/UFO has a 'Lucky Landing' there for the July 4th Seasonal update?

Really close to buying a PC, but I’ve got other stuff I want to spend money on and almost can’t bring myself to do this. Thinking about buying an elite controller to help improvise, but I’m not sure it’d really be much better than going the whole way and buying a PC with using keyboard  &amp; mouse.

Even if we got like superman/iron man/batman the only ones people would actually use are black panther and deadpool (and maybe batman)  I'd honest to god rather wear the Michelin man over the teaser skin.  Maybe we'll get some cool backblings but skins are probably gonna be trash.

Are you guys happy with superheroes?  Do you expect you'll spend as much this season as last?

Think of a grenade, which you can throw on downed teammates to revive them instantly.

This thing would be found in rare, epic amd legendary causing them to be revibed with 30, 50 or full health. 

It maybe should have a small radius in which it revives every downed teammate. 

Addition: Maybe also opponents.  So they can crawl to your downed teammate causing you to not easyly rise your buddy quickly.

This item would be very useful in many situations as a quick revive can make the difference between win and loss.

IMHO, I don't think ""challenges"" should be able to be completed by every player. Also, giving us exclusive rewards for completing said challenges would be dope. I wouldn't even mind paying for a higher-tier season pass if that's what it takes.

TLDR; challenges too easy, give me something harder and more fun (and actually interesting) to do besides searching 7 chests at a random location and opening YouTube to find the ""SEARCH BETWEEN ______"" challenge.

Imagine being able to practice ramp rushes over and over and imagine a closed off, high room where you press a button and it randomly generates mats building into the sky and you have to build up, through them yourself, beating them to the top.  Or rooms where you and up to three people can have build battles.

There are times when I'm waiting for a friend to finish a game so that we can join up.  I usually go solo and then ditch my game.  I'd rather be practicing in a Training Mode/Level.

Mats are super super freaking easy to get, there is no point in trying to make it even easier. It takes like 45 seconds to hit 4 trees and boom you have around 120 wood for fight.


Just dropped, only have a grey smg and someone is coming for you? Spend 5 seconds hitting 2-3 crates, or hit a tree a few times, BOOM, you have a wall/ramp and immediate advantage. 
If you spend the, what, 4 minutes of total gameplay to farm mats, you'll have enough for multiple fights. Spend the time and get rewarded. But no, I just want 100 wood instantly by walking over some loot. 30 mats is just enough so that if you get rushed early and aren't terrible, you get an easy kill. 


It's like 90% of suggestions on here are things that just simply to game too much and strays away from the battle royale and building aspect of this game. 


Everyone also like to complain about bloom, but honestly I rarely have any problem with it, and I've played almost 2000 games. Just stop moving so much and literally most of your shots will hit.


I find that a lot of people I kill around mid range are just holding down the trigger and moving around like their ass is on fire. Meanwhile I'm here crouched and moving slightly left and right and guess what? Most of my shots hit and I get the kill easily.


You see the crosshairs on the HUD? Well it basically doubles in size if you keep moving, meaning the bloom is going to worsen and you aren't going to hit shit. This isn't CoD, constantly strafing and just going to fuck you. 


Yall act like bloom is just so overwhelmingly bad and it's the reason yall can't kill anyone, but it's probably just you. Just watch any twitch streamer play. You'll find that they hit most of their AR shots. Why? because they aren't moving so freaking much. I suggest you guys watch someone like NICKMERCS on twitch and see how he deals with bloom. It helps a ton. 


Instead of complaining about something why not spend the time and get better at it? I was terrible at this game the first few months I've played. But after changing a few things in my gameplay, I got fairly decent. 


TLDR: Everyone suggests things to make the game easier, instead of trying to get better.

I love Fortnite and its easily my favorite game, it has brought me back into gaming and a lot of others too. Thing is, its crap right now compared to what it was. Keep in mind I am above average player with over +300 wins and a 3.94 KD. That doesn’t matter but I know people are going to say “you just suck or cant build” but no I still take wins currently. 

Well whatever, the first thing I want to talk about is the weapon delay. Not in general but with the damn pump. The pump is just a hit or miss like WTF. If you don’t land your first shot, and the other person has a tac, consider yourself dead honestly. I understand the double pump problem and why they gave it a delay but this is excessive. I shoot once, I try to shoot again and its like my trigger button is non existent. The delay shouldn’t be that long. The delay unmotivates rushing. I’m in a position where I can push multiple enemies but I know for a fact that delay is going to fuck me over so I just avoid it now. And don’t tell me get better aim bc theres always that chance that you will miss and there are problems with the hit registration so... 

The delay for the AR’s and everything else is annoying, especially after building. Like why am I the one being punished for being able to build better than my opponent. Also was it necessary for the first shot accuracy BS? Like do people suck that bad that it needs to be implemented into the game? Now even noobs can deagle you from a mile away. Another thing, I don’t know if its lag or a glitch and it hasn’t happened to me but when an enemy is building I am able to shoot through it and kill them. An enemy was trying to heal and built a ceiling and I tried destroying it but turns out I was shooting him through and I killed him. Like that should’t be possible,I’d be pissed if it happened to me. 

I believe Fortnite is not in a good position right now, especially since the new season is coming out. I support these guys at EPIC and spend money to show my support even though the prices are HIGH. Like $20 for a damn skin? But how do they expect this constant support if the game is slowly on a downfall. They should focus on the gameplay and not so much on these cosmetics. Please leave your feedback, negative or positive, I know someone out there has to agree with me bc I see posts like these constantly. ",FortNiteBR

I unexpectedly instead found what appears to be the red/yellow superhero in the teaser Epic released on their twitter today:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbttSeJVAAAST8s.jpg:large


The strange thing is the supposed superhero is labeled as ""Astronaut""
https://gyazo.com/aba3e7dbfb9948f5f7381a0cc2692c6c


Here are the two side by side:
https://gyazo.com/82ce496aaf64ce02beb69996bcbdc89a


I originally thought this was a screw up linking to the season 3 astronaut characters


But then I thought about it more,
The whole Tilted Towers meteor theory going around lately has been that a Comet/Meteor will come down and strike tilted towers on the 30th of april (End of season 4)
but more recently people have been speculating that this could instead be a ufo or spaceship with passengers
I believe this theory now
As most of you know most superheros in DC Comics and such are from different planets (EG: Krypton for superman/supergirl)


Is it possible that the textures are labeled astronaut because the superhero is from a different planet coming to the BR earth on a ship that crashed with a Meteor..?


This is supported more by the image I linked above (Now on the epicgames.com fortnite page and the Epic Games launcher) where we see what looks like the Meteor thing in the sky but redish orange with a superhero inside it!

Comet what you think about this!

Those ""Emergency Alert"" tones are actually modem tones that can be deciphered. Using a program called minimodem, I was able to get the following from the ones on Fortnite:

    ZCZC-CIV-RMT-051181-051700-051093-051199-051095-051830+0100-1641516-WAVYTV10-

Based on the following pages:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/11.31
https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/ipaws/ECIG-CAP-to-EAS_Implementation_Guide-V1-0.pdf

I was able to determine the following:

    ZCZC: Begin Emergency Alert System message
    CIV: The Civil Authorities have issued
    RMT: A required Monthly Test for:
    051181, 051700, 051093, 051199, 051095, 051830
    +0100: Duration 1 Hour
    1641516: Date and time (Julian Day: 164 - June 13th 15:16 - Not sure what the significance is)
    WAVYTV10: Broadcast by station WAVYTV10

In trying to determine what these location codes mean, the following was written:
&gt;PSSCCC - This is the Location code and indicates the geographic area affected by the EAS alert. There may be 31 Location codes in an EAS alert. The Location code uses the codes described in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, ANSI INCITS 31-2009 (“Information technology - Codes for the Identification of Counties and Equivalent Areas of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas”). Each state is assigned an SS number as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Each county and some cities are assigned a CCC number. A CCC number of 000 refers to an entire State or Territory. P defines county subdivisions as follows: 0 = all or an unspecified portion of a county, 1 = Northwest, 2 = North, 3 = Northeast, 4 = West, 5 = Central, 6 = East, 7 = Southwest, 8 = South, 9 = Southeast. Other numbers may be designated later for special applications.

So it appears as though each code requires to ""all"" of some area based on the P code being 0. 51 must refer to the ""area"" the entire map refers to (Would be a state in real life), which leaves the following to be the coordinates on the map:

    181
    700
    093
    199
    095
    830

The thing I haven't figured out is how those 3-digit numbers correspond to potential areas on the map or if this entire thing is BS. I'm also not sure why they would go so far out of their way to make a valid EAS signal and call it a required monthly test, but that may have something to do with the fact that these tones are regulated by the government, and if they issue a real alert, they could get in trouble.

If anyone has any input on what these numbers could mean, I'd appreciate the insight. They may indeed be 6 locations that will be hit.",FortNiteBR

Because of that, it is a shame that so many outfits have a preset model wearing them. For example: That male Easter Bunny costume looked pretty funny. I considered buying it, but then I saw pixels of blonde hair and that really pale skin showing through that mask and I was like ""naww, not that dude again."", because I *frankly believe* that lazy Epic secretly has used that guy as a character model under every outfit whenever it had an item which covers the head, such as the Dark Voyager or the Special Agent - and on a serious note, that blonde guy looks like a complete fool imo, no offense xD.
So yeah, my suggestion: Please let us AT LEAST choose our own character model out of those you have already implemented and let them wear the outfits we want to have on them. Even better (but not that necessary): Let us customize and create our own character.

Example with Pump Shotguns: https://clips.twitch.tv/UnsightlyDeterminedMilkBuddhaBar  

Example with Tactical Shotguns: https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentImpossibleSaladOhMyDog     

Example with Heavy Shotguns: https://clips.twitch.tv/ExquisiteEsteemedMuleUncleNox

Example with LMG + RPG: https://clips.twitch.tv/YawningArtisticWrenchRickroll

Here is the basic process - 

1. Fire your weapon
2. Hit your emote button
3. Swap to another weapon
4. Fire the new weapon

Some notes on this:

- You can do this with literally any two weapons as long as you follow the process properly.
- Tactical shotguns sometimes fire ghost shells where the ammo count goes down but if you swap to another weapon and back you'll find that it didn't end up using any ammo. 
- It's easier to do the trick when standing still
- If you try to do it midair, look to do it at the apex of the jump because that's where the least amount of movement is (emotes cancel automatically if you move too much)
- It's easier to do this when you only have one emote bound so it doesn't pull up the emote wheel.
- Works with Dab/Take the L for sure - haven't tested with others. I assume it works with every emote.

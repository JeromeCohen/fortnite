3,ScythianKongo,1550434098,arog9u,13,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/arog9u/controller_still_needs_optimization_if_were_going/,9,Controller still NEEDS optimization if we're going to have to compete against keyboard and mouse,"E**v**eryone has been talking about how op aim assist is when we should really be talking about how badly controllers are optimized still. 

A controller and a keyboard are functionally the same thing. That means the  only real difference is the shape. Yes controllers will have less buttons, but '*technically'* it is the same thing. One thing is that in comparing aiming with a thumb stick and aiming with a mouse, a mouse will always win.

There are many controller with paddles and additional buttons on the sides or top of the controller. We should be able to utilize these as we like. They shouldn't be locked to other buttons on the controller. Yes there is an issue of 'fairness' that on a console, players with paddles have an advantage. The problem is for people playing in the Event lobbies or on PC servers, where there is no reason we shouldn't be able to utilize these additional buttons. 

Yes there are pro players absolutely shred on controller and can outplay keyboard players. Watch any of them play and you'll see these players have adapted their play style to the chunkiness of the controller. Most players are not even close to their level so these issues effect us even more. There is no controller player that I know of, that can play as fast as someone like ErycTriceps or Mongraal. Obviously the fact it's harder to aim is apart of issue, but half of the plays they make that include swapping are basically impossible on controller. 

&amp;#x200B;

**WE STILL NEED MORE CUSTOM BINDS.**

The update was months ago and there are still just the same few options. Why are there more hold functions, or double tap functions? These features are already implemented in STW. 

&amp;#x200B;

**WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO QUICK SWAP WEAPONS.**

There have been multiple, easy solutions posted to this sub that would work. I don't care if you think it's just ""two or three buttons to swap, it doesn't take that long"". If you're playing against PC players it MATTERS. It's not even the time that it takes to press the button, its the fact that most of us have to check what we have equipped and which slot the weapon we want to switch to is. IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG COMPARED TO PC. Also good luck if you swap into the wrong mode. All they have to do on PC is press one key. That's it. It probably takes half a second or less to switch.

&amp;#x200B;

A**IM 'ASSIST' STILL LOCKS ONTO THE AIR BESIDE THE OPPONENT OR ONTO THEIR ARM &amp; WILL DRAG AWAY FROM TARGET IF SOME ONE RUNS ACROSS THE LINE OF SIGHT.** 

This is the real issue with aim assist, it's way too sticky in certain cases and gets you killed almost as much as it helps. Yes it will lock onto people, but the hard part of aiming on controller with high sens is even getting the crosshair in that vicinity of your opponent. When it does lock onto some point and you try to adjust for the head shot and it's like your cross hair's moving through quicksand.

&amp;#x200B;

**WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH TO BUILD INSTANTLY.** 

The amount of times I have pressed 'B' and then tried to place something, only to see that it didn't actually switch into 'build mode' is ridiculous. PC players don't even understand this because they just press ONE KEY and can place a build and then swap to whatever they want. In it's current state it does not recognize fast inputs consistently, at least on my ping or with the several controllers I've tried. Either optimize the way it works now or give us a hold to switch modes or something.  It just is not fair that we're forced to play on keyboard and mouse if we want to be able to compete without putting in twice the amount of effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Please no comments like** ***""switch to keyboard"".*** I have one. I play on it. I like controller. I shouldn't HAVE to play on keyboard because controller doesn't have quick swapping or instant switching to build. These things can be fixed, it just doesn't make sense that we still don't have a solution.",FortniteCompetitive

However there’s one thing that I can’t do at all in pubs is to drop 10 kills or more.

And why we seriously need a better point system.,"First of all I will introduce my self. I am swagmanerer a relative high level scrim player featuring several pro cords. Also I am an admin of the EU atlantis scrim discord with 160k+ members. 

I play a lot of fortnite and overall I am decently sucessfull with my duo mate ZainX. We are really good in scrims and win many of them sometimes even back to back and even in customs we can hold our own. We even finished ""ok"" in the german pro cord tournerment this week. Our first experience with 40+ moving zone.


I want so say that we are not noobs and that as someone who cares about competetive fortnite a lot I want to make a point about this even and pop up in general.

Also sorry for my horrible english skills. I am not a native speaker obviously. 

1. We will start with the division system. First of all its important to know that a LOT of games use division systems to express skill groups beside conventional Elo numbers. In this case though I am not sure if I like it. In most games the segmentation between players has been very different. For example in all of these ranking systems you had a ""bronze"" division for players that are significant worse then the average ranked player. After that most of these systems went in 20% steps like in SC2. Most then ended up with a 2-5% group called masters or something similar. In these areas games actually got good. And a grandmaster, champion, challanger division for the top view people.
Now I want to ask why there are no divisions between open and prospect and prospect and contender? I mean the division ranges are so huge that some of the lowest contender players could only dream of getting points while on top of the contender vision you see tons of pros smashing them like toys.

2. Now you might think. Well at some point the pros must vanish right and all get into champion. I partly agree with this because its the logical thing to happen but its not what happens. Today and yesterday in solo only 13-15 people made it into champion. WTF. With his speed it would take almost 2 years to fill refill up the champions divisions. Its actually so hard that most of my super high end competitive friends already gave up. Its just not worth sinking in 5h of this just to fail missing 2 points. 


3. The amount of aviable games of 15 is just to low for 5 hours of gameplay. If you actually use 20 minutes for every single game you play you will end up at exactly at 5 hours. But this never happens. This is pop up cup. You will get suicide pushed all the damn time. Its so easy to die to someone suiciding into you and then getting third partied and with this already fail to make the time. Dying in early once already makes it impossible to play the entire 5 hours. A decent solution for this is to give wins or even 2nd and 3rd places a free game. With this you can actually give them more encouragement and they dont get completly fucked over because they missed the 3 points on top. Great idea by the guy suggesting that.


4. The point system is just not good. Its super obvious that playing good for placement is just not rewarded. If you die in solo as 4th you only got 1 single point. Thats draconic low.
Also why such an arbitrary number of kills for 1 point. Why not 5 or 1 or 25 kills. Giving out 1 point at 3 or 4 kills doesnt make sense in my opinion. You should be rewarded for every single kill and every single placement. 
I dont know why epic wants to keep the ranking system as simple as possible as its clearly not good for this game. Back in the qualifiers why would someone waste 25 min of his time only to get 1 point when dying 4th when he just could have killed 3 people in tilted because he got a lucky pump as first. This kind of point system rewards active RNG and not non (or at least less) RNG. This game in its core is about surviving and with this should always result around playing for the win and placement first and as such should reward it. 
At the moment I would even say a reward system like back in showdowns would be good as every kill and every single placement mattered. In the actual system there is no DIFFERENCE between someone that finished 99th and someone finishing 11th. Thats just not fair. Especially looking at the top of champions and contender division you will see up to 30 god tier players in edge and moving zone. How can you not reward these people for getting 11th in such a hell fire. 

5. My next point is the communication around this event. Honestly it was super confusing and if you didnt follow every important epic employee you had a bad chance to fully understand it. Almost none of my non reddit using friends had any idea how this gonna work and in most pro cords and chat there was a ton of confusion around this. Epic REALLY needs to hire new communication staff. 
Its not the first time entire game changers get completly lost in communication. 


6. The integrity of the system. Obviously it was super flawed from a technical standpoint. My friends who happend to be not aviable for the placement matches still cant play prospect because it wont unlock it no matter how often he restarts the game. I went though open with him and he still cant play in prosepct.
Also its just not good that you can only do 1 division a day. Me and ZainX finished open in fucking 15 minutes. Why do we need another 2 days to be able to play prospect?

7. And now the worst. The disappearing points. Today in contender I won my first games with 3 kills and so got 6 points. Then I get back to the lobby and somehow I have 0 points. 0. Nothing. Nada. This happend to millions of people today and yesteday and killed my entire drive. 
We already know how imporant every single game and every single minute is to get out of contender. Remember we have like 15 people even able to do that. You cant miss a single point by a bug otherwise you propably wont make it. Its so frustrating and I have seen several other people stopping to play after missing out on points bc of this. 


I didnt proof read this as I am tired as hell and I also dont really care that much. I wasted enough time and energy with these cups today. 

I just want a fair ranking system that rewards actual results instead of some arbitrary marks that encourage bad decision making, overly agressive gameplay and RNG loot and discourages people from actually taking this game serious and trying to play for win and placement. 


Maybe I forgot some points (just as epic does) but instead of epic I will add them later.

After every skirmish event, there's always complaints about not being able to spectate our favorite players. For quite sometime now, CS:GO has allowed fans to effectively watch matches from the game's built in spectator mode. Any broadcast audio (i.e. what you would hear if you were streaming the event on Twitch), is streamed through the game client. Fortnite would greatly benefit from adding this same functionality for its viewers.

**What about server performance issues that we've seen in the past due to too many spectators?**

Since this functionality is read-only, it's easily horizontally scalable. That is, the main game server merely needs to publish all events to some manner that can be read by replica servers (i.e. a persistent event queue). All game clients would then connect to these replica servers. This would prevent high viewer counts from having any impact whatsoever on the live game server.",FortniteCompetitive

For this reason, I propose a change. This change would, in my opinion, satisfy everyone. What if epic had a built in spectator system, similar to the replay in a new ""tournaments"" tab. People would be able to spectate whoever they like whenever they like and not be limited to the live stream. Epic used this system in paragon, so I don't think its too far fetched.

However, I'll be honest, I want to watch my favorite players and know what they're doing. I want to keep tabs on Tom, Chap, Tfue, etc. instead of squinting in the background everytime they show an arial shot. Tfue and Dmo's win yesterday and Tom's win today were so much less hype then they could have been because it literally came out of nowhere, a sudden ""oh what, they could win?"". And damn, early and mid game is so much more boring to watch - I'd in many cases like to watch my favorite players over two random players fight. Part of the hype of battle royals is about the story of each game, hearing the comps in duos as well. Its hard to be invested when I'm watching different players constantly then losing track of them for the rest of the game.

I love to animation! I had some of the worse news of my life today. I really cant handle any more disappointent today. I know it sounds stupid, it's just a game, but it helps me escape. I love getting new items and cant exactly afford them with money. So, if anyone doesnt have one yet, maybe we can help eachother! Thanks in advance. Sorry for the post here. I'm just trying my hardest.",FortniteCompetitive

He proves this by pointing out there are so few controller players in these major tournaments.

The problem with his logic is he completely disregards 50% of the currently supported inputs.

K&amp;M, Controller, Switch, and Mobile

Claiming that K&amp;M and controller should be able to compete on the same level, yet completely disregarding the FACT that HALF of the supported inputs have had ZERO players competing in major tournaments makes him sound extremely biased in favor of his preferred input.

Maybe he doesn’t think that Switch and Mobile inputs have a place in a competitive setting. Or that increasing the assists on these devices so that THEY TOO can compete at the highest level would somehow not require the same amount of skill required by Controller or PC players.

&amp;#x200B;

I played 1 qualifying round for solos played 6 games won 2 and other 4 I died to being storm pushed and gave up because of how frustrating it is dying to someone who then dies to zone or having to fight someone then for me to die to zone because they have the decision making ability of a dead hamster. However, apparently 12 points was enough to put me into the Contender division and boy is it heavily reliant on RNG. With the nerfed placement points and mats not going to your inventory end game just seems so much of a lottery of who has mobility. Whoever has mobility will then most likely have considerably more mats putting them at a huge advantage in the latter part of end game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Early game it's just hoping you don't get screwed by the loot pool. I consistently land Fatal &amp; Haunted. Fatal I land on the main house which has 11 Floor loot spawns and 2 potential chest spawns. I shouldn't be walking away from there with a grey Infantry rifle and grey SMG. Yet that's exactly what happened yesterday and in fact multiple times I would land there and get no shield and no shotgun. I find Bandages, Chillers, Ammo, Snowmen, Turrets and Infantry Rifles.

&amp;#x200B;

Put bad combination of loot vs a good player with a superior loadout and more shield you're going to get screwed unless the other player makes a massive mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

One end game It was on moving Circles I killed 4 people on rotation but was unable to loot, by the time I got into zone the last 2 players were there I had no mats. the other 2 used a launch pad and a rift, unlucky me, I had no mobility so had to waste mats rotating. If I had mats in my inventory per kill i would of been fine and in a strong position to win that game. I had 180 total Health/Shield, solid loadout. But I die because I can't defend myself. So once again I called it quits before tilt set in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the concept of this is good but it's so hard for this game to be competitive in the current state with how heavily reliant everything is on RNG. Bad Loot on spawn GG, no mobility GG. spammed by explosives GG, circle goes into Narnia GG, unable to loot your kill GG. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SOLUTION (Maybe)**

&amp;#x200B;

They need to tweak endgame zones, make it so they cannot go onto of high land masses and do it so the circle moves less and slower, this essentially nerfs mobility as everyone using it will get beamed as people won't solely be focused on rotating. Set chest spawns to 100%, remove ammo from floor loot &amp; set ammo crates to 100%, remove junk items from loot pool (Chillers, Turrets, snowmen, bottle rockets etc...). Nerf/Remove explosives. Limit rarities on certain weapons. We don't need 3 rarities of Infantry rifle, Pistol, normal AR. Guarantee 1 healing item per chest. Award mats in inventory per kill. Award 2 placement points for top 10 &amp; 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Taa daa, a somewhat skill based BR setting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to grind this and move forward but the reliance on RNG is really off putting, maybe I just had a bad experience and bad runs in the qualifier and the contender games I took part in. I'm not saying this is all RNG and I'm blaming RNG for being a bot but fact is, It's not fun dying to things that are completely out of your control. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - BR's are supposed to have RNG elements but the RNG element in Fortnite is on another level. To make this game as competitive as possible it shouldn't rely primarily on the starting load-out of the person and reliance on RNG mobility items. Remove junk in the loot pool, reduce weapon rarities and adjust the moving zones to limit RNG elements of the game. (Read solution section). ",FortniteCompetitive

Hopefully small lead and projectiles on all guns besides shotguns will ultimately take over and we can get rid of bloom.

I know people are concerned that removing bloom will turn guns into lasers, but projectile bullets will help keep average kill times the same while giving gun fights more rewards and skill. You would only get lasered if you were standing still or had predictable movements. You would no longer have to stand still and wait for FSA while risking getting sniped. 

Projectile bullets like the new infantry rifle for all ARs would be would be a great way of removing bloom. ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

When I started, this was my first FPS on a PC. It probably took me a dozen games to get a kill. It took me 3-400 games to get a win, and I still remember it and the feeling and yelling into the mic and taking selfies with the screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hundreds of hours and hundreds of wins later, the game just felt like it existed on a muted palette. There was frustration when I died, and a moment of relief or sometimes joy when I won, but I had no way to know whether I was any good or whether I was improving more or less than others. You come on a sub like this and see the clips and names and scores, and you're like ""well... I'm trash."" I know I'm never going to be Really Good at this game (I'm 37 and a lawyer and as much as I play I just don't have the time or drive or reflexes or natural skill or awesome sauce), but dammit if getting placed into Contender and knowing that I'm actually in the top 3% wasn't the damn best feeling I've had in this game in a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now that I'm in there, and facing off against players with similar skill level instead of either playing against bots or people who outclass me, I""m having a blast and learning SO MUCH. I've only played 10 games and already I feel like I've improved and am having the best, most fun, most competitive games of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it shouldn't just be me feeling this, it should be all the kids in the game who get a chance to get their first real Win, against players of their skill.  They should all get to feel the joy of moving up a division. They should feel the progress of a win, and the sting of an early loss. They should be able to see that they are getting better, moving up ranks, and mastering this beautiful game. This is what the game is about, and what Ranked would bring to us every day.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen quite a few posts on this topic already and just wanted to elaborate on my experience. Many of you are already aware of the Share the Love placement series and how divisions were divided up. Now I'm not a fantastic player by any means and didn't really expect to make it to Champions. I only had time for one session and qualified for Contender with 19 points. I wasn't too salty and knew I could easily get the pin and move up. Fast-forward to my Contender matches today and it didn't start off too badly. Ended my first game with 4 points and my second game with 3 points. Was off to a good start, but that's pretty much where the fun ended. For the next 3 hours I began to sweat my ass off realizing getting 25 points in contender was going to be extremely difficult. Every single match after my 2nd game was filled with highly skilled players and never seemed to stop. Considering I started about 1.5 hours late I realized I was never going to get this pin. Not only do I not have 5 hours to try to obtain it, but even with 5 hours I don't think I could. I played pretty well today and ended with 17 with a little luck on my side. Now I'm not salty and I've previously stated I'm not that great and didn't think I'd qualify for Champions. But contender is freaking wild, and way more difficult than trying to get 21 points in the original share the love qualifiers. I can think of numerous mistakes, poor judgements, mechanical errors that if fixed would have easily netted me with a 21-28 point finish depending on how many corrections I made. But not matter how much time, or how well I played I seriously don't believe I could ever get 25 points in Contender. I even think guys like Tfue and Zexrow would have trouble getting 25 points in Contender. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not salty or really complaining, but might be something to think about in the future. Qualifying for Champions the first time is about 10x easiers than rising up through contender, if that was the case would should have simply had more qualifying days + time slots. Very difficult to commit 3 hours blocks in the middle of the day to a video game. Lastly, I can't wait to hear what Poach has to say about this. As many are aware Poach stopped playing solos at 14 points meaning he will have to get 25 in contender to move forward. I'd bet $1000 he can't do it and I think Poach is an amazing player. I simply think it's a tall order for anyone and I'm very interested in seeing who manages to climb out of Contender...if anyone. ",FortniteCompetitive

I am sorry for the people who don't understand what BR is supposed to stand for which is most of this sub but the nature of Battle Royale games emphasises survival, and not brainlessly W-keying with no consequence.

IMO double shotgunning should come back. It allows for more play styles, and it puts you at a disadvantage. Not to mention with the recent damage fall off nerfs and the fixed spread, it’ll be way worse than season 4 and be more skill than luck.

Pump-smg was also recognized(and might still be)stronger in the end(as an smg has way more range than a shotgun).

Main points of discussion:

-Should it come back and why/why not?

-Would only allowing it in tournaments be better since the bad players won’t get destroyed by it?

-Should the circle timer be *reduced* rather than removed?

———This even allows for more tweaks they could make with it. Like make double pumping have a longer circle timer than pump tac so you could go for quick burst shots or higher damage shots but slower.

-Should only blue/green pumps be able to double since gold and purple would be op? Or maybe just green pumps by themselves since they don’t have the 100 body?

In the current Solo Share the Love Event you get points like this

&amp;#x200B;

**Kills**

3 kills = 1 point (Total)  +1 (Change in points)

5 kills = 2 points (Total)  +1 (Change in points)

7 kills = 3 points (Total)  +1 (Change in points)

&amp;#x200B;

**Placement**

Top Ten = 1 point (Total) +1 (Change in points)

Top Three = 2 points (Total) +1 (Change in points)

Epic Victory Royale = 5 points (Total)  +3 (Change in points)

&amp;#x200B;

Max Points Possible per game = 8 points

&amp;#x200B;

In the previous pop up cup you could get 2 points for top ten, 2 more for top 3, and 2 more for the epic win. This led to some players complaining about bots camping planes, and people that weren't skilled making it to end circles. Epic nerfed placement points as a result of that and I understand why. To a certain point I agree with what they did. However, making you only get 1 more point for top 3 is in my opinion not good for the state of the game. The Fortnite endgame is already very RNG dependent, and making it so you only get one more point for top 3 and a whopping 3 points for the win makes the weapons and the heals you have even more important. It is extremely demoralizing to get third place or second place and only get one more point. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My proposed change is to keep the points for kills the same, and make one small change for placement points.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Placement**

Top Ten = 1 point (Total)  +1 (Change in points)

Top Three = 3 points (Total)  +2 (Change in points)

Epic Victory Royale = 6 points (Total)  +3 (Change in points)

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a huge change. But I do think it is important to reward players for making it to end game circles, whether in tournaments for money, or even for pop-up cups. Otherwise we may see a rise in people just w-keying and going for 7 kills and then leaving that game with 3 points. What's the point in playing for end game and the win, if realistically in champions division you'll probably end up with a top 10 or a top three finish? You get two points and maybe one or 2 more from the kills you had. You wasted roughly 25-30 minutes. You have 5 hours to get as many points as possible and realistically you will only be able to play 10 games out of the 15 game limit. You end up with 25-30 points. 

Now what if you played for the kills? You play 15 games and you get 3-4 points every game so your ending points number will be way more than what you could get playing for the win. Obviously the above scenarios are not representative for all players, but in the end **the current system promotes w-keying over playing for the win.**

This is the most useless argument you could make, and yet it seems to be the most widely posted all over this subreddit. It makes all of us controller players look retarded. Let me explain why.

KB&amp;M will always have the overall advantage over controller. You could give controller players an additional 10% damage on all weapons, yet this wouldn't change, due to the inherent advantages of playing on superior equipment. Now, anybody would agree that giving controller players an additional weapon damage buff isn't fair, regardless of the fact that M&amp;KB is still superior overall. Yet here we are in this sub, making that very argument for ADS spam and trying to justify it's existence based on the fact that M&amp;KB is still better overall? 

Now, don't misinterpret the intent of this post. You can still make the argument that ADS spam isn't overpowered on console, or that the recent nerf was excessive and had unintended consequences, etc. Those are all valid criticisms. But please stop using the argument I listed above, as it makes all the valid arguments to be taken less seriously by PC players that see dumb kids in here regurgitating the same ol ""pC sWeaTs are sTiLl bEttEr tHough!!""

**Shotgun**

\- You can prevent all damage when getting shot dead on while standing  
\- You can prevent all damage when getting shot dead on while crouching  
\- You can get shot through the bush when getting hit on the feet (bush does not disappear)  
\- You can get hit by one pellet only when people aim on your head  


&amp;#x200B;

**Rocket Launcher**

\- You can prevent all damage when getting shot dead on while standing  
\- You can prevent all damage when getting shot dead on while crouching  
\- You can not prevent damage when getting hit by the explosive damage (crouching and standing)   
\- **YOU COMPLETLY NULLIFY ALL DAMAGE INCOMING IF YOU WEAR A BUSH AND HAPPEN TO SHOOT YOURSELF WITH THE ROCKET (unless you shoot at your own feet) and in BOTH scenarios, the bush wont disappear**  


**Sniper**

\- You can only get hit in the feet or legs, bush does not disappear  


**Grenade Launcher**

\- You can not prevent any damage  


**Clingers**

\- You can prevent all damage incoming when stuck (while crouching and standing)  
\- You can not prevent any damage from the explosive damage (while crouching and standing)  
\- You'll still get hit if you apply the bush AFTER you've been stuck

&amp;#x200B;

**Stink Bombs**

\- You can not prevent any damage incoming from the stink, bush does not disappear though

&amp;#x200B;

**Sneaky Snowmen**

\- A sneaky snowmen cancels out a bush and vice versa

&amp;#x200B;

**Spike Trap**

\- You'll still get hit by the full 150, bush does not disappear (from all angles -&gt; bottom/top/side)

&amp;#x200B;

**X-4 Storwing (Planes)**

\- You'll completely nullify the first shot  
\- You'll still get full damage when getting bodied/rammed by a plane  


**Mounted Turret**

\- You'll completely nullify the first shot

&amp;#x200B;

**Assault Rifles**

\- You'll nullify the first shot  
\- You'll still get damaged when shot in the feet or legs, bush does not disappear  


&amp;#x200B;

I can't test more for now but I hope this is helpful so far. In case I missed something (which I did for sure) make sure to comment and I'll test some more and update this thread. 

My conclusion as of now is, the bush is actually pretty powerful now. It's a free shield that can potentially prevent a lot of burst damage.

I'll usually flip on a popular streamer during food breaks with work or just to watch a game or two before I fire up the game myself.

Seems like the last few days just about none of the main streamers are streaming Fortnite. Sure, lack of Pop-Up Cups probably hurts, too. Still, a little nervous about the game losing some steam. I still enjoy it, but I can't help but feel like the lack of streaming interest right now is at least in some way correlated to more than just big streamers' travel schedules. Burnout, lack of new updates, etc?

Indeed, I read often here that people would love to play ranked and would only play ranked if available.

However, I have a feeling that even if it would be nice at first to see progression, once reached ranks corresponding to my skill level playing ranked could be much harder and stressful than normal pubs.

I am not a very good player but certainly above average, I have a 5% win ratio in solo. I guess most people here are around 5-10% win ratio. Well, I think that for us it's clear that it would be MUCH easier to win in pubs than in ranked.

Ranked is good for really casual players who would have the chance to practice without being killed immediately by almost anyone in the lobby, and it is good for the most skilled players (i.e. people who always get pins at pop up cups) who need a real challenge. 

But for most people here (or, to put numbers, 5-10% wr players) I think it's clear it will be much harder to do well and get wins... Are you sure you would enjoy that?",FortniteCompetitive

i for one think its a great idea for items like balloons, fireworks, boogie bombs and just generally gimicky items to be removed from competitive play (pop up cups/ranked)

explosives are kind of touchy as obviously they can be spammed and abused, but there are actually quite a few ways to use them tactically which can work out very well but can still be countered in some way, epic could possibly sort this out by lowering the amount you could use or something

but the main thing I've been thinking about and would like to discuss are snipers, alot of people hate the heavy sniper for its insane body shot damage and bullet drop(which is now shared with hunting rifles and silenced bolts) but what would your opinion be on them being totally removed from competitive play? i personally think that as there is no practical counter for them , obviously you can have completely random movement, but anybody can hit a lucky snipe

If you don’t want 27 players alive as the first circle closes in, then make people miss out on points for dying early. 
Your points are divided into 4 categories(Placement, Placement milestone, Kill, Kill milestone) 

•Placements 
You get one point per placement
99th = 1 point
98th = 2 points 
50th = 50 points
1st = 100 points

•Placement milestones(these points aren’t cumulative)
90-81 = 10 points
80-71 = 20 points
70-61 = 30 points
60-51 = 40 points
50-41 = 50 points
40-31 = 60 points
30-21 = 70 points

-Top 20
20-11 get 5 points per placement continued on from 70 points ( so 20th would get 75 points, 19th  would get 80 points,etc)

-Top 10
7 points per placement continued on from 120 points (so 10th would get 127 points, 9th would get 134 points,etc)

-Top 3 
3rd place = 180 points
2nd place = 200 points
1st = 250 points

Placement points and placement milestones points are added together. So 1st place actually get 350 points

•Kill points 
Each kill is worth 8 points(even after 7 kills)
 
•Kill milestones(not cumulative)
3 kills = 10 points
5 kills = 15 points
7 kills = 20 points

So 7 kills would get you 20+(8x7) = 76 points

•FINAL SCORE
Your final score (all the kill, placement and milestone points) is divide by 10 so the numbers don’t get too high. So if you get 210 points in game 1, that will be represented as 21 points. 

An example: a player comes 1st with 7 kills
Placement: 100 points 
Placement milestone:250 points
Kill:56 points
Kill milestone:20 points
Total:426 points/10 = 42.6 points
FINAL SCORE = 42.6 points",FortniteCompetitive

I am a «professional» swimmer (training 20-30 hours pr week and i am top 3 in my country in my best events). Fortnite is a hobby of mine and i like to follow the competitive side of the game. E-sport is a pretty new term and im just curious to know what goes into that term. 

I see alot of Fortnite «pros»/streamers choose to drop competitive events to stream because of revenue/money. As an athlete, is just dont know how this is something these players choose to do. When i spend countless hours in the pool to improve and practice i do it because i have a genuine motivation to be as good i can be. It seems like money is the only motivation for some «pros» and that is something i just cant understand. Why spend so many hours to become a champion, just to choose to drop the competition to make money from streaming. Dont they have any pride and motivation to prove themselves? How can they call themselves pros/esports athletes when they make these choices. People like Daequan is signed by a professional esports org and chooses to drop competitions all the time. I really cant understand. Can someone please try to explain this huge difference between «esports» and regular sports?

So before I took a break, my load out was always, shotty, smg/shotty2, AR, snipe/rockets and heals.


Now after my break with a chance to retrain muscle memory I went for the conventional, AR, Shotty, Smg, heals, sniper/rockets.



However, i started pressing LB/L1 far too often after my Shotty shot so I swapped to Smg, Shotty, AR, snipe/rockets, heals.


I just want to know how you guys all have your loadout, and why it works/the benefits to it, for some inspiration, so I can train my muscle memory whilst it's still a bit out of sync. ",FortniteCompetitive

Thank you for patiently waiting, Sean. Galaxy skin will be available to those who pre-order the Note9 and TabS4 only. At the moment, we cannot confirm whether or not this skin will be available for purchase after this period. As part of the pre-order offer, Note9 and Tab S4customers will also be able to access a 50% discount on V Bucks (in game currency). We are awaiting details on how this will be redeemed and will update as soon as possible.

No, of course you haven’t. 

The thing that angers me over this topic isn’t just about the emotes. The thing is that developers has spent time and effort on these emotes, which are completely unnececary (in necessary I mean what emotes are actually used regularily)
And it kinda saddens me to think about what awsome stuff we could’ve gotten instead.

First off, I am no expert and I know that this community is so much more capable in solving these problems than me. I just would like to share my thoughts and exchange with you in order to get this beautiful skin in a community effort. 

So, you play Fortnite on a Note 9 or Tab S4, and then you get the Galaxy skin. Only one account per device gets the Galaxy skin. This leads to two options on how they can implement the redeeming functionality:

1. When you receive the Galaxy skin playing on a Note 9 or Tab S4, they store a unique device identifier (UUID?) backend-side in order to prevent attackers (us) from trying to redeem to Galaxy Skin multiple times with the same UUID (device)
2. When you receive the Galaxy skin playing on a Note 9 or Tab S4, they store a string/token in (probably user-inaccessible) storage, e.g. hardware-backed keystore inside TEE or directly in the eSE. This btw is how many apps implement their user banning functionality when there is no backend account management: They store something on the device (think of a string ""I am banned""), in storage you cannot access. The string remains on the device when uninstalling the app. So the banning app checks for this string every time you start it, and in case the string is there, you cannot use the app.

**Both options may be vulnerable for root attackers on the device.** 

Option 1 could be compromised by an attacker spoofing/faking the device identifier towards the fortnite application or towards the Fortnite backend (although latter may be addressed by the Fortnite application using TLS with certificate pinning, did not think this through yet). This way you could play, get Galaxy skin, reinstall app, fake identifier, play, get Galaxy skin, and so on. 

When it comes to Option 2, it depends on how exactly it is implemented. It can be worst case or best case for us. Generally, it could be compromised by root simply deleting the token from the storage. Depending on where exactly it is stored, it can get harder and eventually impossible to do so. If it is inside the keychain, root should be able to delete it (best case!). If it is inside the TEE keychain, root still may be able to delete the token, I need to investigate how exactly the TEE communication with keychain trestle works on newer Samsung phones. I am afraid the attacker (us) would need to spoof  the fortnite application towards the TEE in order to interact with the token, which is, at least based on that little bit I know, impossible. 

The worst case for us would be if they implemented option 2 with a dedicated applet residing inside the TEE (trustlet) or the eSE (cardlet), having only two interfaces to the Fortnite application inside the Rich OS: ""use token"" and ""check for token"". First is used for redeeming the Galaxy skin and creates the string inside the applet, and ""check for token"" may be used every time the Fortnite application starts in order to see if this device has already redeemed a Galaxy skin. In this case, I would have absolutely no idea on how to address this, although we'd need more information (how does the applet get to device etc.).

I will try to investigate how they do it as soon as I get my hands on a Note 9 or a Tab S4, and keep you guys posted. 

In case you see anything I got wrong or mixed up, or anything that in your opinion is worth digging deeper, please comment and share your thought. In case you can help investigating the details for the skin redeeming functionality, please let us know!

I'm not talking about streamers who get paid playing this game, im talking about normal casual players, who try to be above midrange and so on.

So why is fortnite dying? It can be seen on individual players, that since season 4, matches played inside a season, have gone more than 50% down, compared to season 2 or 3. Why is this happening? Why people keep playing less and less, is the game just getting boring or is there an actual reason from updates that keeps people not playing the game like madness.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have to think, what makes us play games? Because its fun? Because its fair? Because we like to prove to ourselves we are better than others? Probably one of these reason keeps YOU playing the game. So what happens when you tick away those important aspect of gaming? The gaming experience goes lower, so does playing hours and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic, u have done a wonderful job with this game, but with all the things u have done, the game becomes more and more luck than skill and this... keeps us away from this game and in one year, ill never touch this game again. Building is what made you, and more you take that aspect away, the more you become like H1Z1 and other similar games. If we would want to play a H1Z1 type game, why we would have ever touched your game?

After seeing all this, I came up with 3 theories
1:The Enforcers are made by the rift to hunt down Drift and bring him back to the real world
2: They are Government Agents trying to again, bring him back to his world
3: They were brought from a Dystopic future by the rift to kill Drift because he is an anomaly who shouldn't be there

I'm getting sick of dying to smgs and doing 8 damage with my pump. You should have just kept the Tactical smg and made it epic and legendary instead of making the overpowered Compact smg. The pump is practically un-usable because of the damage and spread. The only decent shotgun is the heavy, and even that isn't nearly as good as the pump in season 3 and early season 4. So what I think you should do is bring back double shotguns or buff the shotguns, remove the compact and drum gun, bring back the tactical smg and make it epic and legendary, and get rid of bloom. In my opinion, these changes will make the game much more enjoyable. Thank you.",FortNiteBR

Tier 100 could be herobrine. I know it would be very frightening to see a herobrine in game so they may have to nerf the spookiness just so other people have a chance to kill him. 

Pickaxes-
I think they should add a diamond pickaxe to the item shop for 10000 vbucks. I know that seems a bit expensive but it’s worth it cause every swing will break anything instantly and will do 300 damage to any player.

Was reading earlier the ""state of development"" article and I read something that got my hyped ! it was this part of it :  
&lt;&lt;  Our goal is to provide the best possible quality of service everywhere  in the world. We’ll continue to evaluate other areas where we can add  additional data centers or new regions to improve performance for  players. Some of the areas we’re investigating beyond Southeast Asia are  the Middle East / Northern Africa and Russia. We’ll have more to share  about our plans over the coming months. &gt;&gt;  


Why did this made my hyped ?  
Simply because I am from Tunisia (north africa) and playing fortnite sometimes isn't fun because of the ping, like we get here average of 80-90 ms, and if you are super duper lucky you'd get 60-70ms, and you know that ping surely affects playing the game. 

Epic games is kinda now thinking about us, and hopefully this idea will become real one day !

Thank you.",FortNiteBR

I checked on my S9 and I received the skin. 

I will answer questions about the process but just so you know I got lucky. It just so happens I found a Note 9 that no one played on yet. I also was able to avoid the 10-15 minute display reset on the phone.

PRO TIP: talk to the guys at the store and they will probably help you get the skin if it's available. I spoke to the Best Buy guy about phones while doing it and he gave me the heads up to say keep using the phone to avoid the reset and then he let me be. Doesn't hurt to ask to use the display phone.

Ya know games are supposed to be FUN sitting on the floor waiting for 35 seconds while your base gets torn a new one. There is not enough trap mats given out, i have maxed 1 and 2 but I cant get more traps because I cant get one stupid skill point.


How to fix horde bash

tune down the takers, like getting hit for 10k health 20 times a second aint fun is it? No one can say it is fun.

Add default base layouts so new players dont build some stonewood retrieve the data looking ass box base(these bases are not forced but are simply recommended)

Give constructors more mats for walls/traps
Give soldiers more mats for ranged weapons
Give outlanders more Fragments around the map

If i got a friend/family member that buys a note9. Can i log onto their phone using my epic games account and recieve the skin? (They do not play the game) and play 3 games and 48 hrs later recieve the skin?

Or would i need to do all the stuff within samsung shop first? Cause my understanding is. You only need the shop for the vbucks portion. And you can get the skin just for playing 3 games then waiting? 

It would be alot easier to just login to friends said phone under fortnite rather than having to deal with samsung shop.

So i guess the question being. Can i get the skin(not vbucks) simply thru fortnite. Without having to use samsung shop?

About a year ago I was doing cocaine almost daily, binge drinking and all kinds of tomfoolery. Eventually I lost my job and decided I had enough, but it wasn't enough. I still couldn't help but text dealers and find myself at the bar. Eventually I decided I just had to stay home until I found a new friend group. I could handle and control my problem when I was by myself. I just had to keep my phone off all day.

So I had to find a way to spend my time, so I downloaded fortnite. Fast forward about a year, I haven't touched cocaine or a drink in about 8 months, and I reconnected with friends from college by playing online almost daily. Now, my buddy from Boston who I play with almost daily found me a job in Boston and I'm about to move into his place with him. Lan party's for days. He basically was a sponsor, id hit him up anytime I wanted a drink and he'd respond "" dude hop on fortnite, let's run duos"". He even would sneak into the bathroom at work and play on mobile with me at times.

So thank you epic for giving me a positive activity and opening me up to my friends who have a positive influence.

Just build. Lol",FortNiteBR

Snipers has become OBSOLETE because none is peeking from a tower anymore they are just going head to head building and falling off most of the time.

I have played 20 games and this has happened every time where I kill 3 people and 1 guy comes behind and kills me when I am healing up inside a 1x1. Naturally I spectated a guy who killed me and turns out he has 2 kills and then dies by someone with 8 kills which ultimatetly dies in a 1 vs 1 to a guy who sneaks up on him with 20 hp and shotguns the poor guy 2 times so he dies...

I just want to ask something.

In every match I'm in I always see a lot of people do that. It sometimes pisses me off if I'm doing like the search chests for the battlepass challenge. I'm still so high in the sky while people already on the ground. I'm not a new player, so I know I should jump from the bus earlier before the bus reach my destination. I also tried to dive directly down but, the outcome is not the same. And from what I observe, they didn't dive to the lower altitude ground. So that makes me wonder how they do that.

But, the upside is I had 1500 people watching me make a fool of myself, shooting me tips in chat and offering to help. 173 Epic friend requests :) So I've been squading up with some really good players and great people and they've been showing me the ropes. The best part is the fun I am having.  
  
So here's where I'm at. I graduated from total noob to bullet sponge. The past few days saw me upgraded to ""bad golfer"". You know, the one or 2 good shots a round keep you coming back :)  
6 squad wins, carried for 5 of them then actually kicked ass in one. I'm playing 50v50 a lot, more action to practice on. I'll lose 4 out of 5 one on one battles still. Got to get better at building. My plans never survive the first shot, need to stop panicking.  
  
See you in game!

Here's why I won't be spending another dime.," I've spent roughly $200 on this game over 2 accounts. Was crazy addicted and tried to sell all my friends on this. So why the vow to not spend anymore on this game?

The lack of skill based matchmaking (SBMM) or a ranked mode. I'm a solidly above average/intermediate level player. This puts me in grey area where winning by beating scrubs feels unsatisfying, and running up against pro-level players is frustrating. There are fewer and fewer games now that feel satisfying in the end game because the final fight is neither fair nor fun -- it's not fun stomping a scrub, and it's not fun getting stomped by streamers. Most games feel like tediously looting and harvesting for a payoff that never happens... which is basically a waste of 15-20 minutes.

Epic, I do not understand why there is no effort put into a more competitive game mode, where people can be sorted by skill level.

I don't think it's a stretch by any measure to say that a large chunk of fortnite's unprecedented success is the lack of competition/other good PvP shooters at this time.

But I'm hopping back on to the Destiny 2 train. Forsaken sounds like the developers actually listened to the community and incorporated feedback. And anyone who has played that knows the gunplay in Destiny is just flat out unmatched in other shooters.

And come March of 2019, I'll probably be on Division 2.

Epic, I want to keep spending money buying silly skins on your game. Give me a reason to do so. Give us a competitive/ranked game mode, or give us SBMM.

TL; DR -- I'll keep spending money on stupid skins if we get a competitive/ranked game mode, or if we get some skill-based matchmaking.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You can count on one or if you’re lucky two people landing there so you get a kill or two right away and can loot the rest to your self.
2. You can get as much wood as you want, you won’t have to worry about getting into a build fight and running out of mats right away because you can get max wood every time you go there, and you can get brick outside of tomato temple. 
3. You never have to worry about not getting shield, even if you get no minis or big pots there are a ton of mushrooms that can get you to full shield
4. It’s usually not that far away from the zone, whenever I go wailing I get a pretty good zone, and if you get a bad one there’s sometimes an atk at man made, it there’s rifts near tomato and ice cream truck

Those are my reasons why I think wailing woods is the best place to drop.

Here's why I won't be spending another dime.,"I've spent roughly $200 on this game over 2 accounts. Was crazy addicted and tried to sell all my friends on this. So why the vow to not spend anymore on this game?

The lack of skill based matchmaking (SBMM) or a ranked mode. I'm a solidly above average/intermediate level player. This puts me in grey area where winning by beating scrubs feels unsatisfying, and running up against pro-level players is frustrating. There are fewer and fewer games now that feel satisfying in the end game because the final fight is neither fair nor fun -- it's not fun stomping a scrub, and it's not fun getting stomped by streamers. Most games feel like tediously looting and harvesting for a payoff that never happens... which is basically a waste of 15-20 minutes. 

Epic, I do not understand why there is no effort put into a more competitive game mode, where people can be sorted by skill level.

I don't think it's a stretch by any measure to say that a large chunk of fortnite's unprecedented success is the lack of competition/other good PvP shooters at this time.

But I'm hopping back on to the Destiny 2 train. Forsaken sounds like the developers actually listened to the community and incorporated feedback. And anyone who has played that knows the gunplay in Destiny is just flat out unmatched in other shooters.

And come March of 2019, I'll probably be on Division 2.

Epic, I want to keep spending money buying silly skins on your game. Give me a reason to do so. Give us a competitive/ranked game mode, or give us SBMM.



TL; DR -- I'll keep spending money on stupid skins if we get a competitive/ranked game mode, or if we get some skill-based matchmaking. ",FortNiteBR

Of course I go along with it. I'm able to download the fortnite installer app and then start to download the game itself. In the app store it did show the pop up for the galaxy skin that was shown yesterday by some others on here. I didn't hint to the worker what I was doing as all of them seemed like they hated their job and found looking at paint dry to be entertaining.

So I'm standing there pretending to check out the phone for about 15 minutes because good lord that store's wifi is a dinosaur.  Anyways watching the download slowing go by all of the sudden the fortnite app and the fortnite installer were removed from the phone.

However I don't think it was worth a seven week wait.

It's a very disappointing skin to say the least. Although I will say that the Season 5 Battlepass skins exceed Season 4 by a landslide, but Season 4 did reign supreme with The Visitor skin which you got as a part of the Blockbuster challenges. Enforcer is not ugly in any way, but not what I would have expected for a skin unlocked for completing seven weeks worth of challenges. There are Epic skins and even Rare skins that I like more.

What are your thoughts on it? How could Epic have improved this skin?

[Pre lightning cactus ring](https://imgur.com/a/5ADf7Kh)

Each cactus is getting bigger as it goes round, so that lightning strike was fairly loud and not the biggest cactus. So maybe the last lightning strike will be super massive and cause some form of inter dimensional cube to appear in the sky? Who knows but I’m stoked &gt;.&lt;",FortNiteBR

We have a policy here in the UK that if you take out a contract phone, you have 30 days to return it if you dont like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Heres my plan -**

Get an upgrade out with the Samsung Note 9, then redeem the galaxy skin, then return it with no penalty fee.

&amp;#x200B;

I know its a lot of hassle \*just\* for a galaxy skin, but its an exclusive skin, and i like exclusive stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Important Question -** If this all goes to plan, and i redeem it, can i play with the skin on my PS4? Like will the skin transfer over to my PS4 account?

&amp;#x200B;

THANKS! ",FortNiteBR

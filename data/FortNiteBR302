19,Straybvll,1529863064,8tjjzz,41,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tjjzz/ramps_should_have_less_hp_to_encourage_base/,0,Ramps should have less HP to encourage base fights and help bring balance to the player skill gap.,"This game used to be a base fighting battle royale game with some pushing and build battles mixed in, but as the overall player skill base has increased almost all of my fights are people sprinting right at me with ramps/walls. We all love watching streamers do it and now everyone has adapted this playstyle over time. The problem is that it is almost unbeatabled. That is why the best players use it. When the best players are on another level using a tactic, you just think that they are good, but when every decent player is using the same tactic, this game is a very different. The most fun games for me are when you have a couple teams in bases at end game and each team is trying to pick each other off and figure out the best move. I feel like pushing is too efficient. I feel like this isn't what the game was meant to be. Launch pads used to be useful tools for pushing a base, but now they are the risky way of doing so. Traps used to be your bases defense, now theyre only effectively used for tilted tower kills, or trick plays.

As someone who has been a pretty good player up to this point, who plays alot (almost 3000 games), and makes it to end game 20 percent of the time with randoms,  I feel like I am now far behind skill wise. I play on console and have not needed to always get into build battles or counter aggressive pushers in order to win. I feel most of my bigger fights now include me getting ramp/wall pushed and nobody I play with ever build battles them. It results in my team not coming out of the fight very strong and usually not surviving at all. I've played so much because I enjoyed this game the way it was played. It is now slowly turning into a bunch of Ninja's. Why does that playstyle/tactic have to be ""good?"" One playstyle should not trump the rest, or the game is going to be much less dynamic soon.

I dont want skill based matchmaking or for everyone to have to get good at this tactic/playstyle. I also don't want this tactic completely removed as an option. I think the only solution is to lower the ramps HP. With the ramp having a lower HP, there could be a better chance of stopping an aggressive pusher because the time it would take to cut his structure down would be more balanced to the time it takes him to get to his destination. Often times its the wall AND the ramp that stops me from cutting down the pusher before hes already at/above me. This would discourage people from pushing this way AS MUCH. Pushers could still place a wall(which will be at the same HP as always) in front of their ramp to defend it from shots - making the tactic still viable. Though, they may Have to place the defensive wall in front of the ramp to minimize their chances of getting cut down.

TLDR; Ramp/wall aggressive pushing is becoming the new norm as opposed to its previous status of being a highly skilled player/builder tactic and is completely changing what the game is overall. As it stands, it often takes too long to cut a ramp And wall down before the pusher successfully overcomes you. **Slightly** lowering only ramp HP would help lower skill players defend themselves and force pushers to use walls to defend their ramps and/or push in such a way less often.",FortNiteBR

I currently love the posibility Epic gave us with different styles for ours skins. However, I think they missed an opportunity with it and will try to explain this in this post. If you agree, it would be cool to rate the post so it gets noticed by the community.

Currently we can use styles on the following skins:

\- Carbide / Omega  (Lights and Armor)

\- World Cup Skins (Number and Country)

\- Blockbuster (Face)

Why not give this skins a little ""rework"" and add the same color/number options? Given the fact that it is practically the same concept as the skins we can already customize:

\- Dark Voyager (Example: [https://imgur.com/a/mpjeB20](https://imgur.com/a/mpjeB20))

\- Dark Vanguard (Example: [https://imgur.com/a/A58Ma8W](https://imgur.com/a/A58Ma8W))

\- Jumpshot and Triple Threat (Example: [https://imgur.com/a/0LKdqtI](https://imgur.com/a/0LKdqtI))

It would be a really nice touch for the guys who spent 15-20 bucks on those skins, plus they could hit the daily store one more time as something ""new"".

Thank's for reading guys, hope you like the idea, I'm sure I can't be the only one that thinks about this.",FortNiteBR

Rules of the mode are as follows:

Players are assigned a target after 1 minute and this target will be visibly marked on the map at all times.
If you kill your target, you will take on your victim‚Äôs target.
You may only deal damage to you target and your assassin.
Last man standing wins.
It has also been suggested that there should be an increased spawn of Snipers and Silenced Pistols for this mode and the storm will act the same as the normal Battle Royale mode.

This game mode will keep players on edge and will encourage players to get closer together and force more combat. By having the one minute after dropping from the Battle Bus before being assigned a target gives all players plenty of time to loot and to choose their loadout wisely before going after their victim.

As the targets location is always known, it would encourage players to get into combat and try to eliminate their target as quickly as possible, without being taken out by their own assassin. It will definitely keep everyone on edge and would quicken the pace of the game.

If your target it taken out by other means, such as their target, fall damage or the storm, your victim will switch to them. There will always be someone hunting you down and you hunting down your own target. This should encourage fights all the time and will stop players from being able to ‚Äòcamp‚Äô around the map.

Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Would like to know how you guys feel about this.",FortNiteBR

1. Match Duration -
For my squad , matches take way too long and is unnecessary. Blitz is a fun gamemode to us because of the fast pace action packed theme the gamemode presents. In a normal squads , there is soo much time wasted because of long unnecessary storms timings and gathering resources for building. Epic can fix this by either showing first circle immediately and reducing each storm timings by a bit and also allow more resource spawns in the map (either by resource gain per tree or floor loot)

2.Shotguns
Self explanatory, shotgun damage is broken and inconsistent which leads to infuriating moments

3. Camping
Everyone camps now and its boring. Could easily get fixed by faster storm times

4. Crouch/TFue peek
The ghost peek with ARs/Hunting Rifle/etc must be nerfed. In fights , no one peeks normally and as soon as you peek they crouch peek and kill you. 

5.OP Weapons
Scar in fortnite is unbalanced and broken.

6. Hop Rocks
Ruined season 4. People just kept jumping into your build battles and destroying you.

7.Building
People phasing and jumping through your walls is dumb. Should be fixed ASAP.

8. Keyboard and Mouse players on console
I dont even know why this is a thing. Provides unfair advantage in build fights.

9.No custom games
Although Playground is coming what about a 1v1 arena or a custom lobby? It would be soo fun to battle against friends

Thats most the things my friends and I hate in fortnite. Please fix this ad consider soon

What if every player had a permanent island, a home which they can customise from top to bottom. For example like the terrain, ground style, buildings, roads, trees etc... Basically every item in the game. New buildings and variations of items come out that people can earn to make there own island unique to other peoples. Upgrade your island to make it better than your friends and compete to have the best one.

From there you can use your island to host private custom games with friends which could be a standard Battle Royale or you could even choose any of the LTMs that have previously been in Fortnite. Matches can be open for the public to join to compete in full lobbies of people on your island.

Players could make there island public so people can travel around and see how people have designed there island. This extends the game into being more social + it make the game feel more personal to everybody as they have there own place they can show off.

There would be SO much potential with this it's ridiculous!! I just hope a few people see this to understand my idea and possibly extend this into something more. 

SUMMARY - A customisable island that each player has which can be designed and edited in any way imagined. Upgrade and unlock new items for it. Used to host private custom games with friends + the public. Island can be made public for anyone to join and walk around without actually playing a match which acts as a new social part of the game.",FortNiteBR

Change my mind.,"I feel that the battle royal version of fortnite only got so popular because it started off (and still is) free to play. At the time, Pubg was the #1 battle royal game that had millions of players active. But eventually, people got a little tired of all of the bugs and glitches that are mostly fixed now. But when Fortnite battle royal came out, people got interested. Since it was f2p, anyone could try out the game and see if they enjoyed it. Most pubg players switched over to fortnite battle royal because it was fresh. But think about it, if the game only costed 10 dollars, many people wouldn't even bother. Expecially when the game kinda looked a bit bland at launch compared to it today. kids under the age of 11 couldnt get it without asking their parents, and lots say no. When the mobile version came out, they could just get it on their parents phone. Plus with the addition of micro transactions, many kids waste their money on useless skins, emotes, and now tags.

The only reason the battle royal version was even made was because Epic Games didn't have enough money to keep up with making Fortnite save the world. After seeing the battle royal genre blow up, they got an idea to make their own version. With how much money they are gaining now, (400 million dollars was made in the month of april) I don't see how they cant keep up with other games. But since Fornite battle royal came out, almost all of their staff has moved in the battle royal department. 

Im not saying i don't like Fortnite, I just think that it wouldn't have gained the populairty is has today if they released with a price tag.
Especially with how ""Save the world"" was turning out to be.
This is just my opinion, so feel free to try and change my mind. I might even reply to some of them.",FortNiteBR

I think that is too easy and people still die to fast. I even did a headshot damage of 17. 17?! Can you imagine that? That person must be furious that I hit him for that much. I think you guys should nerf the shotgun a little bit more. Damage should be reduced to 1 damage max per shot and a headshot should have a negative multiplier. So that means the opponents gain health when you shoot them in the head. That way it takes more skill to kill someone and you have to be accurate and try to hit him in the balls or toes, whatever float your boat. Please could you do that? It would make the game more fun to play.
P.S. Almost forgot could you change the time that it takes to get your pump ready to 10 minutes? That would make it more interesting and could do a stare contest with the opponent in the meantime. Keep up the good work! I enjoy playing Fortnite!",FortNiteBR

no player should ever play any online game with 100 ping. It really is demoralizing when you try speed up your gameup, eventually you hit a cap because well the edit take 0.8 seconds to responce, walls and structures aren't placed fast enough. 

Peeking is useless LMAO, I still get get shot behind a wall when i peek back in. still jumping corners and dying. 

I love this game, we all do. Please give the community what they want, more servers.

We need Middle-East servers. Please make it happen! 

Put on Dubai so people from Saudi-Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and even bahrain can enjoy! I'm sure other middle-eastern countries will be happy too. 

Bring the servers to Dubai. 


We can all complain to epic about nerfing mats, changing the gameplay, bloom and what not, 

BUT NOTHING ever takes the fun away from the game like ping issues. 

I really hope an epic employee would give a response to this. Not many games have middle-eastern servers so I know my keep my hopes way too high for this, but its all we got. Hope, that someday developers actually think about middle-eastern consumers.

Its the most brilliant idea ever, its CASH COW. There are lot spoiled and rich folks here who would gladly throw TONS of money for skins. Kids who have their own credit card and not their mothers. ",FortNiteBR

I have been consistently having the UE4 Engine Crash for months and months with absolutely no fixes working. No matter where I look nothing works, No youtube video, No google assistance, no redditors. Every single fix that has ever been suggested has never worked and I'm not the only one. I'd really appreciate it if Epic could come out with something about finding a fix for this as they most definitely recieve thousands upon thousands of crash reports daily from fortnite players everywhere. It is to the point where the game is completely unplayable due to completely random crashes with the same crash error with no crash logs and no debugging tools at all. I've done every possible fix and I'd like now for Epic to chime in and try and fix this as soon as possible. This crash error is stopping thousands of people from playing the game and it's really upsetting as this is the only game I currently enjoy. This isn't a complaint, More so a cry for help. From all of us enduring this painful crash. 
Props to Epic for such an amazing game and I mean absolutely zero disrespect to them as they do an amazing job. I'd just like this issue sorted out or at least for epic to say something about it.

In my opinion, it would be entirely impractical from a business point of view, to allow unlimited refunds. But from the consumer perspective 3 lifetime refunds, seems unfair. So I thought the best solution would be to circumvent the problem entirely with a sort of trial system.

How it would work:
1. Remove the refund system.
2. Give players one ""Trial Ticket"" at the start of everyday (when the store cycles), these tickets would NOT stack.
3. You may use this ticket to ""Rent"" (buy) any item currently in the store.
3a. You may NOT rent an item you do not have sufficient V-bucks to purchase.
4. This item purchase will only be valid for one (1) match.
5. After your one match is complete you will be offered the chance to purchase the item you rented, if you do not, the item will be removed from your inventory. 

Clarifications: (1) Regardless of whether or not your rented item is equipped during your match it will still be removed from your inventory afterward. So don't forget! (2) If you purchase a skin with a back bling, you will get both items, this would allow you to try a new back bling with one of your previously owned skins, or vise versa. (3) If you rent an item, and do not play a match, it will be removed from your inventory, upon the daily store cycle. This would prevent players for hording the items. (4) If anyone can think of any other special cases, please let me know!

In closing, I am really happy with this idea, it cannot be exploited (at least I am not clever enough to think of a way to exploit it, if you can let me know), and it solves the problem of ""buyers regret"". At least anecdotally speaking, I have known I want to refund a cosmetic, after only a minute or two of use. So to give players that minute to try the item out, seems like the perfect replacement to refunds. There is of course the argument that Epic wouldn't want this as players would realize a cosmetic is bad and not purchase it. But I think that is great! It encourages Epic, more then ever to make a cosmetics people really want to keep. I am starting to ramble, at this point, so I am gonna stop now, but I would love to talk to other, and improve upon the idea, as I am sure it is not perfect. Thanks!

If we take a look at the new Fate skin, we can see she is quite slim, and if you compare her to any other character in the game (female) you can see a pretty big difference. 

I think it's all an illusion. The female characters have always been wearing some sort of cargo pants, which looked big on them, which also made them look thicker. In reality, it's just the pants.

The female soccer skins, and even triple threat. Look at their legs, they are literally sticks. Even if you look at Zoey. It is because Zoey and Fate have silm non cargo pants, which make them look not thick. 

I'm not sure if I'm tripping, but it was just something I'd noticed when I was looking at the new Fate skins. Unless Epic is just making the new female skins not thick anymore. The OG skins seem to have a lot more thickness than the new ones. What are your thoughts on this?  ",FortNiteBR

Furthermore the bloom system makes any gunfight that isn't a shotgun, scoped AR, sniper rifle, or RPG, a game of luck not skill. Fortnite is a strategic building game with shooter elements, not really much of a pure shooter. It is a shooter because you shoot stuff but I'd argue that most of the shooting is not skill based (obviously you have to be at least sort of of good at aiming you can't be way off and the scoped snipers and AR's are 100% skill), the building is skill based. The only thing that requires any sort of extraordinary skill is building which is partly why I think fortnite is so interesting because it's basically Minecraft with slightly different tile placement and the addition of a really simple 1 dimensional system of gun play. I also think it's why fortnite will never be competitive because while building as a skill gap is interesting, it's not as predictable and consistent as you'd need to really nail down a competitive game mode or style that would have any lasting community. Competitive games that stay competitive and last are really repetitive and pathological and consistent, and when I say repetitive I don't mean boring. I just mean the rules are the same each match, the field of play is the same each time. On Fortnite you might be on a mountain or you may have a bad circle to deal with or you may be near some foliage that blocks building or gives a somewhat random advantage to another player. The unpredictability and the ""each match feels unique"" part of fortnite and any battle royale for that matter makes them all terrible candidates for the development of lasting competitive play or leagues in my opinion. I'll still continue to play way to much of Fortnite but I just had some thoughts on it.",FortNiteBR

Go to sleep between Midnight and 3am(i stay up and watch T.V sometimes.), i wake up between 9am and 12/1pm, i do my daily routine(brushing teeth, waking up etc.) i usaully don't eat till dinner or whenever(i'm thinking on eating a pop-tart or something but most flavors i don't eat.) anyway, i play fortnite around 30 minutes to an hour after i wake up, now should i improve my schedule and change it or something? Would you recommend something that is better then my schedule or something(im guessing my schedule is pretty terrible but i really wanna get more then 1-3 wins a day in fortnite.

I really don't know what to do at this point, and I really feel like it must be me doing something wrong. I've tried playing passively/defensively in a tower, playing aggressive and ramp rushing the first people I see, playing very ""smart"" and waiting for good times to flank people, I've tried playing the edge of the circle, playing the center, and everywhere in between. I have also tried dropping in high population spots in the beginning, more obscure spots, etc to maybe change up my route as I make my way to the final circle(s). Regardless, I still will either somehow be in the center of people fighting, or fight someone just to live with 30 health and be instantly killed by someone that was close enough to be watching the fight.

I don't know what to do and I would like to know if anyone else is consistently having this happen, or if it's just something wrong with my play style.

I‚Äôve maxed out at 19 kills in a solo and my career high in a win is 15. Recently I‚Äôve been getting double-digit games pretty regularly ... BUT ... every time I get into top 5 situations, the players left alive are all quality players, and a lot of the times I get sandwiched or just get straight up out played. 

So I decided to try something ...

I created an entirely new profile on PSN and tried out solo. Entered the first game with no wins, no matches played, being a level 0 on the account. The VERY FIRST GAME IN I dropped Moisty and proceeded to collect 12 kills in one of the easiest wins I‚Äôve ever had. Here‚Äôs how the ending of the game played out:

Top 4 Situation
4th Place‚ÄìStanding still inside Dusty factories
3rd Place‚ÄìCrotch walking menacingly at my one-by-one
Last Guy‚ÄîCouldn‚Äôt build out of Dusty Divot and proceeded to try and shotgun me from 100m away

I straight up dominated the game, which I rarely do. No one built anything. All no skins who were easily trap-able. I took a total of 425 damage and 99 of that was due to fall damage. 

I‚Äôm just saying try out a new account and see what you think? I‚Äôm pretty sure Epic kept the skill-based match making decision pretty hush-hush. It‚Äôs almost 100% fact in my mind.

The skin itself is in my opinion dope, here is some pros and cons about it. (All my opinion and i‚Äôd love to hear yours)

*Pros*

Its a female which means a slimmer character model.

Its looks great with almost all dark colored backbling if you don‚Äôt like the orb one.

*Cons*

Its not very flashy. in my opinion this is a con since i like bright skins.

The hood does not come off. this would be a really cool feature and was really hoping this would be a part of the skin but sadly no.

*Summary*

Overall i think this is a great skin, remember, all my opinion and i‚Äôd love to hear yours.

Spread that across the remaining 16 days however, and you get 33,265.6 XP. Theoretically, you would just need about 34 games a day if you snagged 1000xp each game with no help from challenges and daily quests. 

So if you want omega lights guys, you ONLY need to snag less than 34 wins a day for the remainder of the season! Oh wait thats terrible and unrealistic.... 

I can't speak for anyone whos at level zero, but I for one am not at level zero, I am at level 60, with those calculations, I only need about 18 games of 1000+ XP per day. 


Now here's the spin: Lets factor in the final 7 days as double XP. The best way to do this is to simply add an extra 7 days to the total you're dividing by, as effectively you're compressing two days into one with double XP. 

That brings it down to 12,456.5 per day. About 13 games of 1000+ XP gain. Or 26 games of 500ish XP gain. BEFORE any assistance from daily challenges or weekly challenges.

358,SecretPotatoChip,1529795245,8tdp9p,89,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tdp9p/unpopular_opinion_double_shotgun_needs_to_go/,7,Unpopular opinion: Double shotgun needs to go.,"Now before you little rascals come crying about how your crutch strategy is changing, here me out.

Double pump/heavy is broken. The pump/heavy balances its high damage, range, and accuracy with its low fire rate. Double pumping/heavy removes that, making it unbalanced. How is that justifiable? How is giving the high damage pump or heavy the same fire rate and higher magazine size as the less accurate, lower damage tactical fair? It has no downsides to you. It gives you an unfair advantage and the small disadvantage doesn't even come close to justifying it. 

The inventory slot argument isn't valid. If you use a double pump/heavy and fight me, you having one less inventory slot makes almost no difference. It doesn't give me any tactical advantage.

Double shotgunning is also a low skill move. It's super easy to click scroll click scroll. It took me about 5 minutes in the lobby to learn. Anyone could do it. 

When I get hit by a pump or heavy, it is literally impossible to tell if you will use double pump/heavy, and by the time I find out, it's usually too late. Double pump or heavy can take less than a second, and despite having very good reaction time, it's still often too fast to block the second shot.

Epic fixed the double pump before and no one minded. It was brought back with the weapon swap delays that everyone hated. If it's ""No BiG dEaL LoL jUsT gEt GuD nOoB,"" then why did epic remove it the first time? (this was before they started to ""cater to casual players""). Answer: it's a broken mechanic that was not intended and it gave an unfair advantage.

What about pump to tac, pump to heavy, or heavy to tac? That should still go because it still removes the delay after firing a pump or heavy when you can fire again. Is it as bad as double pump or heavy? No, but it still gives an unfair advantage. 

You might argue ""what about double bazooka or sniper""? Double bazooka isn't a big deal because bazookas are hard to find and the have a swap period. Both of them also have to be reloaded before you can use them again. Same thing applies to snipers. Bazookas are also loud and easy to plan for. You can hear if someone is using double bazooka and there is usually a slight delay between when you hear it and when it hits something. 

I'm not a potato player. I can build fine and i am excellent with the tactical shotgun. I pick it up over a pump every time. Am I the best player? Of course not. 

If you use double pump, please stop. It's a broken mechanic that shouldn't be in the game. 

Proposed fix: you need to cock the shotgun after firing it (basically how it was fixed the first time), even with the weapon swap delay. 


**TLDR**: In my opinion, double pump/heavy shotgun shouldn't exist because it removes the waiting period between each shot, which is crucial during shotgun fights and gives you an unfair advantage with no true disadvantage.",FortNiteBR

Might stop playing for few days just cause I love this game so much and don't want to get bored of it.

And IMO a way to improve this for next season if epic wants to make a skin that is hard to get maybe make it like the black knight where you have to play for an hour or two everyday to get it, and there are lots of great ideas as well like making a skin the requires certain amount of wins so that only skilled players can have it.

Please learn from other developers mistakes.,"Epic, if you guys are deciding to change the meta because it does not give an opportunity to casual players or to less experienced players, nerfing what makes good players be good, is not the way to deal with the problem.

How are new players suppose to improve and become better when you guys are nerfing materials, when in fact giving more materials to less experienced players will allow them to build more and thus practice and become better. Reducing and making materials harder to gather will also make it for them harder to gather and it will take them longer to improve. 

Look at Destiny, the game was amazing back in Destiny 1 early days, at the end of Destiny 1 the game started getting mass nerf that will make good players be affected supposedly to help casual players become better. No it did not make them better, good players still dominated but the changes that Bungie through was gonna make the game easier for new players just made the game more boring for everyone. 

Now look at Destiny 2, no grinding, nothing is really hard and challenging in the game, AKA casual friendly, game is DEAD.

I think the only way to help new players become better is by dropping the new Playgrounds mode, not by nerfing the standard game. I do not know how long it will take for you guys to drop that mode, but the things that you guys think will improve the game for the better, it will not.

Hands down you guys are the best developers out there, keeping 100% transparent and communicating with the community quick.

But making games casual friendly NEVER works. Playground will be the solution 100%.

Now many will probably think that I am exaggerating, and I know the past nerfs haven't been big, like the llama nerf of the -10 material floor loot.  But if you're not aware Epic plans on adding a cap to materials. Now, I am not sure if they will buff material gathering if they add the cap (which could be a good idea), but if they cap it, and in no way, buff materials, then I might be done with Fortnite, farming is not fun and building makes this game more competitive since bloom already ruins it.

Again, I do not know what waits for us in Tuesday but Epic needs to carefully look at what they are doing.

And then, the cum went out of my dick and it splattered all over my TV screen. It felt... so rewarding. But then the post-cum guilt came. I felt so ashamed that I masturbated to pixels on a screen.

I for sure understand that im bad at the game and pretty much what im doing wrong, but i just cant progress.
My building isnt so good and my entire playstlyle is bad - i make bad decisions that end up getting me killed. 
My building is very rusty and i find my self not understanding what im doing/trying to accomplish in the middie of a build fight. While im building i seem to miss a lot, meaning i dont double ramp right or i cant recover from getting stuck so i just choke and get down from the building.
Other than the building, im for some reason playing very slow. In Fortnite i find myself just walking around slowly when in games like CS:GO, BF or GTA im playing very fast, jumping around and making my self a hard target.
Training seems almost impossible since theres not traning mode and i just cant practice in normal matches.

I didn't play shooters growing up and now I'm 31 trying to get competitive at fortnite. I've played over 2000 matches and I barely got my first real solo win.  My k/d is a measly .4 I lose 99% of shotgun fights and am rarely an asset to my squad. But I'm finally seeing the light. I've started actually winning shotgun fights, I've finally been able to hit a mostly standing still target with my sniper. And I just had my first ever 6 kill game. 

I play on console and my sensitivity is currently 6/5 ads is 4.5 and scoped is 3.5. I know I'll eventually have to go higher if I want to be able to build effectively, so I was hoping to get some tips on when I should do that and if you think my sensitivity being this low is bad. 

Also, if you were in my shoes at one point, what helped you. I feel like most fortnite tips are for people who can actually aim without looking like they're having a seizure, so I'd love any tips for folks in my spectrum.

 The double pump nerf actualy made sense fine, ill give you that, but this last nerf was brutal, you used to pick a shotgun because you could one shot people at 200 hp, but this really hurts good players, first of all hitting a 200 headshot is really hard, and if you get caught its your fault

 Just to be clear the nerf was (for the green pump) 90 damage to just 80, and the headshot multiplier for 2.5 to just 2, max damage now is 160, now why does this hurt good players?

 Good players usually play more agressive because they can win fights, and after a fight, the healing they will use will most likely be the mini shields and bandages 75+50= 125, so now with your 160 headshot they can be killed in one shot, (you can do this even if they used a med-kit btw) but if they're fighting someone who has full shields and camped all game, and they managed to get a lucky headshot, they can still oneshot them, but not be oneshoted, it was so annoying to see kids crying about shotguns, but I thought epic would be smart and not do this, i was wrong, they could nerf it at least so the dmg would cap at 199, so you'd still get a chance, alltought really hard, but the nerf was just overkill

 TL;DR:  Double pump nerf - ok, new nerf punishes good players and is also overkill",FortNiteBR

The whole Fortnite community backed him and got ban almost rescinded. It was libel and slander by Twitch.  Now Epic Games on the same thing Ninja and many other large streamers do they gave him lifetime ban.  Neither ban means anything  0 nothing.  Both companies were trying to keep him out of Friday Fortnite and it back fired. Tfue has now won Three Friday Fortnites cementing his status as Number 1 in the world.So many dismal negative remarks of him being toxic. Its a game of killing people not tiddly winks he is very competitive and yeah losing sucks and if you don't like to lose quit.  Too much butt hurt whiners wanting him to talk to them like there Mommy.  Its a persona when gaming folks, not the real person so unless you know him cut the snarky remarks.  And he was already rich and famous on youtube (Joogsquad) he doesn't care he plays for fun. Why do people troll? must be jealous.",FortNiteBR

So i really don't know whether or not to get a new pc to play fortnite (because mine right now sucks ***), or to get a console. Because i like the playing with a console controller more than mouse and keyboard, but i don't know what i would do with the console afterwards (regardless whether or not it's PS4 or Xbox), so what would you redditors think from a standpoint like that. 
Thanks in advance ;)",FortNiteBR

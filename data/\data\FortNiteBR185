The Revolver should be a balance between close-medium range and should shoot decently fast to compete with smgs. A ‚ÄúFan the Hammer‚Äù type Revolver would work great in this meta, more damage then SMGs, but only 6 shots and a slightly slower fire rate than normal smgs. It would be great for finishing shotgun kills, or it could be used to quickly ambush and down an opponent with a few headshots. A quick reload too (put all 6 bullets into the chamber at the same time) so it can compete with other guns. 

All i‚Äôm saying is the old revolver was and still is garbage. Even if you increase the damage it‚Äôs still never going to be used (facts).If you want it to actually be used, make it viable and fit it into the meta. A fan the hammer revolver could do that. ",FortNiteBR

K/D like 2.2 or so, and lately especially, I cannot for the life of me believe that there is an uncommon level item (trap) that not only takes up no inventory space, but does 150 damage, has no carry limit, and doesn't take any significant amount of time to ""arm."" In addition to this, I was just killed by one being on the complete opposite side of a 1X1, which normally makes it so they don't trigger. 

In my opinion, they would be much more fair with some sort of counter, such as if a player is dancing they wont be triggered. Or, possibly nerfing them back down to 75 damage each, OR, giving them an initial placement time, such as 10 seconds before they go off. I think back when epic nerfed them they were perfect. Traps aren't supposed to be used in fights, they are meant to be fire and forget items.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I think they are just lame. Yep, Epic has added all these new and creative ways to play and go about this game, but the best they can think of for a trap is spikes? There should be a little more creativity and thought put into this item.

I was banned since like August, And i was banned for cheating, even though i wasn't, I call it false reasons, this is going to be my last attempt on trying to get unbanned from this crap, since i know that if this isn't gonna get me unbanned, then probably nothing else will

Epic Games Name: KsW\_JustaKid

so, when i appealed saying i wasn't hacking, Someone named Petar answered me, saying ""You have been observed using Cheats to gain an advantage against other players in Fortnite"" Even though i wasn't, but also, that means they had evidence of me hacking right? anyways later on we continued with the messages, until we came to a point where he didn't respond, like he ignored me, anyways it can't be a program in my pc that made me banned, since he said himself ""You have been observed using Cheats to gain an advantage against other players in Fortnite"" also the same day that kind of ban message came up, i was in playground with my friend, i was lagging that day too, Petar also mentioned ""Further to the above if you are getting the IP, VPN, machine, or cheating persistently over a period of time, it is likely that your machine itself is banned"" i just don't get why my machine was banned in the first place, My friend later on told me there is no IP-Ban, that i can format my pc and play again, today i did format it, but i still disconnect with the ban message

Now those who are Right now typing me stuff like ""your fault for cheating"" or ""you liar"" just fuck off, stuff like what happened to me happen, Also i'm looking for serious reply's, like a staff or someone that has something that can help me get unbanned, and about the staff thing, Mostly i'm looking for the evidence of me hacking, if you don't have it anymore, at least check if you even had it in the first place.

We all know bloom, and hate it. But what if I told you that it's because you're either shooting incorrectly, using the gun at a range that's too far, or both.

* When shooting the gun, the crosshairs expand. The more they expand, the worse the accuracy. 

The culprits? Not moving, not crouching, and/or not aiming.

By doing all of those things, you will greatly reduce the size of the crosshairs, and thus, increase your accuracy.

* Damage drop-off aside, if you're out of range, you'll accomplish little.

That crosshair is going to be much worse at longer ranges for obvious reasons. 

If your gun doesn't have first-shot-accuracy, then either get closer or switch to a longer range gun. Dual wield pistols (for example) aren't supposed to kill someone from 100 meters away.

I say this because, I for one am pretty good with a Tac. Tacticals are just made for someone like me because I am bad with Pumps and Heavys due to their extreme accuracy, and DBs are far to inaccurate to be used at anything besides point blank range (which doesn't work for me).

But Tacticals are inaccurate enough that if I screw up a shot by a bit I can still get some damage since my target doesn't have to be in the middle of my screen, but it is accurate that if I need to use it from a slight distance, I can.

Another reason why Tacs are better for me is because they shoot faster than Pumps, its great for me in that sense because I try to get out as many shots as I can to fill in the blank space in between when I miss or do low damage. The faster fire rate works out in my favor quite a lot because I've had situations where I've gotten killed during the wait between shots on a Pump and situations where I've killed someone with a Pump during their wait time.

Now as much as I love Tacticals, I can't pretend they are perfect. They do have their flaws, the wide spread and lower damage being obvious. There's the fact that unlike Pumps, Tacs can drop in gray, putting them at a slight disadvantage but not much. Another flaw is one that relates to the lower damage and accuracy, is the fact that one shots are less easy to pull off. Although you can get 100-120 damage one shots they are obviously harder due to the accuracy and damage.

I'm sure there's plenty of other shit that I'm missing.

My point with this post is: Just because the gun doesn't work out for you doesn't mean its bad.
I mean I'm bad with Bursts and think they suck, but I constantly get clapped by people with Bursts.

Ok cya, have a good day, thx for maybe reading.",FortNiteBR

I can no longer go into a game without facing copious amounts of sweaty try-hard soccer skin players with the Ragnarok cape who turbo build the Taj-Mahal after taking a single hit. Oh and TTV btw too.

It isn't fun anymore. I have no troubles building/out building or getting wins, I don't exactly struggle in that sense but the game itself is no longer fun. It's the same thing every single game. I feel the game turned to poop when turbo-building came out.. It gets to a point where you're in a build battle and you just shake your head and realise ""These are the kind of players I deal with every single game."" 

It's not that players are getting better, it's that turbo mode ruined the game in my opinion.

It never needed a nerf in the first place. It was only called overpowered by pro scrim players. The double barrel shotgun was so situational that it would be useless to use it most scenarios. The only scenario it was useful in was when someone jumps into your 1x1, and that it all that scrims is. So it‚Äôs obvious scrims players called it overpowered but in pub matches it was just another shotgun. Not overpowered or underpowered. Now the current double barrel it renders useless in scrims and pub matches. You are probably better over using a pump and only a pump than then current double barrel.

Its exciting, fast paced, and its a new way to play fortnite that we've never seen before.  That said, fortnite - at its core - is about building.  And disco just doesnt have that.  50s did.  I like the pace; I like the non stop action.  But I can find those in Call of duty or any other FPS.  The large team modes, as I understand them, are basically practice.  People play it because they arent yet able to compete in the proper game, or because they just want a quick warmup.  Disco doesnt really help with either of these.  50s does.  

No one is getting better playing disco.  They might be getting better at disco, but put them back in a real game and they'll die to the first half decent builder they encounter.  50s, for all its flaws, forced you to build.  Soaring 50s removed a good deal of builds but its still considerably more than disco.  

To be honest, I dont like 50s.  I think the reason some people cant compete in the real game is that everyone at low skill levels plays 50s, so there are no viable targets for new players, making those new players go to 50s, creating a cycle.  Basically, 50s is needed because 50s exists.  If they got rid of it, and those players were sorted into the regular modes, theyd find each other at least some of the time and have fights they could enjoy - while actually getting better at the game.  My friend only joined Fortnite a little while ago and I told him to avoid 50s like plague.  Now hes actually a decent player because he had to learn how to fight good players, rather than the bots in 50s.  Hes got a ways to go but hes a hell of a lot better than many of the players I know to have been playing for whole seasons longer.  

But if we have to have a large team mode, 50s uses more builds, and that makes it the better option for improving players.",FortNiteBR

I am tired of entering games where people dont survive, they just want a KDA.","I want to make this absolutely clear for anyone who doesnt understand games and PTFO. The objective of BR is to survive and win, not KDA. its not hard to get high KDA when all you do is choose to fight noobs. You wont get better at the game playing people who cant even contest you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why do i even rant? because its sad people dont understand the point of a game, and it is always the ego filled players thinking KDA is end all be all for being good. Ninja has high KDA, because he plays solo squads while streaming to 50K+ whom we all can assume are at the least not as good as most pros. viewers will go into  game and head directly to the streamer with 1 item or none.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the Pro series going on makes you think kills are everything and their not, surviving is. I am tired of having boring match were half the game i have to look actively for people. Before the first circle even closes most games are down too 1/5th the lobby. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesnt help that if epic increase the amount of kills for 1 point, it wont matter.

Same goes for thirsting, I have seen players intentionally have my teammate down to 1 shot. But instead of winning the fight and reviving his team, he rather get a spiteful kill on a DBNO. Come on, I know there are a lot of kids, but whats a DBNO going to do if you lock them in a box... you secure their loot, and a safe spot to heal up.

&amp;#x200B;

I know people are going to get angry and start calling names or say im bad, but how can you say im bad if im playing the game it was intended to be... PTFO - Survive and be the last one alive. Dont get me wrong I like kills, but i also like kills from players who actually TRY to live and not just get 1 measly kill so their KDA doesnt drop.

&amp;#x200B;

They took off Friendly Fire, and everyone was in this sub whining, complaining. then 2 weeks later. Majority of players enjoyed the fact they could play more aggressive without consequence ( i still disagree with taking this away, but i digress)

&amp;#x200B;

All i am asking is the community and epic to be open to the idea of testing a NO KILL DBNO.

&amp;#x200B;

How this would work. Player is knocked. based on their level of hp, their Sight diminishes. And if you lock them down in a box, Honestly how useful is their Intel over the sounds of the enemy and building noises? Having 1 less gun is already a disadvantage.  And to add to that, Why arent we considering killing DBNO sportsmanlike and ""THATS JUST HOW THE GAME IS, YOU DONT LIKE IT LEAVE!"" Mentality. I personally think in squads 1v1, there is absolutely no reason to kill a DBNO when they cant give any legit info while boxed. and i think if you get bested in a 1v1 or 1v2, that team deserves a chance to fight another team 4v4. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again this is my perspective, you dont have to agree. And i really dont expect you to because honestly how would either of us know if the game would be better or worse without a try? Anyways all i ask is NO PERSONAL attacks, no derogatory statements and some open minded discussion. after all whats the point of being a community if we cant rationally discuss aspects of the game people are clearly against or for?

The island will reach Loot Lake, flip over and do nothing for a couple of hours. Soon, it will start to make gurgling, lava type noises. After a day, the top will start to turn orange and on Monday, an in-game event will happen. The cube will be shot out of the volcano an land in the center of the runes, which will start a ‚Äúritual‚Äù that Dark Bomber and evil Drift (can‚Äôt think of the skin) will host. This will also start Fortnitemares. Lava could also be shot out into different parts of the map as well, and Loot Lake will become Lava Lake. 

TL;DR 
The island will flip over, make a volcano, start a ritual, and start Fortnitemares, possibly changing the map and Loot Lake forever.

I'm not suggesting double pump comes back, just make it so theres more variation in peoples loadouts rather than AR, Shotty, SMG, meds and likely rockets because this games just reliant on spamming and a game where no skill is involved. I don't even think theres a point to writing this, because little Timmy's just gonna call me bad at the game and Epic's gonna be too busy bumlicking Ninja and granting his every wish to actually care about the community.

&amp;#x200B;

No storm. The floor is lava that insta-kills you &amp; rises steadily throughout the game.

The ""destruction rate"" of builds is **dramatically** reduced, so that you can build/outrun a base-less fort infinitely.

Infinite materials.

Infinite build/running will make players invulnerable to the threat of lava, but very vulnerable to other players. Vice Versa.

Air drops galore.

[If your build touches the lava it becomes encased in molten lava and can't be destroyed. Got this part of the idea from this linked post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9hgxi4/concept_for_an_ltm_the_floor_is_lava/)

&amp;#x200B;

New weapon: A bow with a magical string tied to the arrow. When it's shot it sends out a massive fortified tunnel of mats from point A to point B. If the shot is angled incorrectly (in a way that mats can't angle) then it automatically chooses whichever ""workable"" angle is closest. It could be a 1-by-1 tunnel, but I'd suggest a 3 wide, 2 high tunnel.

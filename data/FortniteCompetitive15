What is the point of connecting all of Asia to the top corner it makes no sense you need to either connect all of Asia to the Singapore which is in the middle or split it between south east Asia and japan it ridicules that all of Asia is put on the same server. It is equivalent to putting all of north and south America on the same server it is straight up idiotic and after half a year you have still not fixed it. We don't care if you split the prize pool between the JP and Singapore that's fine we just want to be able to have some competitive opportunity.  BTW epic if u had some common sense you would know that their are way more player in the sea region then JP. look at the map their are way more country's that get high ping to japan then those that get high ping to sea. it is time you finally fix this and i hope you know your game is already half dead in Asia because of this issue. you can keep ignoring this issue but if you fix this I guarantee your game will gain soooooooooooooooo  much hype in this area and you will make literally double if not triple the money form this region.,FortniteCompetitive

He is 4 years older than me but it’s not really a problem, but he works and goes to school and maybe gets 15-20 hours, barely even half of that we can play duos. This sucks because my solo game is not bad, I placed # 17 nae in the semi finals on Saturday, not as well on Sunday but at least top 1500, and i feel like I learned from my mistakes.

So now here I am putting my all into, and my brother is play less than me and he does this more on the side, even though he likes playing (maybe a little less) than me, but still, it’s not his main focus because he has school and work. 

In two weeks he says that he will have 4 days of total free time and 3 days of working until 6:30, which wouldn’t be Saturday or Sunday, so there is in end in sight sort of.

I think that we have no chance at getting top 100 even for these tournaments and to me that just sucks, I hate the fact that if he wasn’t my brother I probably would drop him. I’ve talked about this all to him but each time I try to play with someone else he seems to act a bit differently towards me, not in a negative way but I notice. We have goodish chemistry because obviously, we are brothers.

So I’m struggling to either start finding someone to grind with or just stick with him because soon he can play more, but even then I think it will be too late to THEN start grinding, but I dont know, it’s got me feeling really down lately and I hate it. 

TL:DR : my brother is my duo partner but he can’t play as much as me until 2 weeks from now, but even then his fortnite experience is about 6 months of scrims but he isn’t bad, I think a different duo would give me a better chance but I need some advice.

I’m not sure if this is allowed to be posted on this subreddit but I just don’t know what to do and i haven’t for about 2 months so it sucks, also; we share a room and his computer is like 4 feet away from mine, but my mic doesn’t pick him up really",FortniteCompetitive

I posted the images and a heatmap in a Google Sheets for people to look and see how contested their drop would be at the top level.

I've wanted to make a post like this for a while, but with the upcoming events, it seems like a good time.


* **Part one: Outside of the game**

I've seen a lot of improvement with myself after a few outside the game tricks. 

A lot of the time I'll see people who play in uncomfortable or odd positions because of space, preference, etc. I can 100% say that this can determine your level of gameplay. After moving my mouse off the lip my desk had for it and putting it up higher, and turning my keyboard 90 degrees, I've had such a better feel for the game. As well as changing the way I sat and where. After slouching for all my life and recently trying to fix my posture, I've seen improvements. It's also helped out the friends I've recommended it to. I wouldn't say to sit straight up, but to sit kinda in the middle, back straight but also not as straight as you would be when standing up. Where your positioned can matter as well, I used to play with the monitor really close and taking up all my vision, moving back a bit has helped me, It feels more comfortable and relaxed.

* **Part two: In game**

Whatever your problem may be, whether it's building, aim, editing, or all three, you have to practice them. Everyone knows this, but what's the best way to practice?

**Aim**

For aim practice, you should definitely use things like kovaaks or air booster, but these are set in low-stress environments and can be tricky to get used to, after all, they're basically different games. How I and a few others I know have managed to get our aim better is to force it. Now I don't mean to sweat 24/7, but to use higher precision weapons. If you only use tags so you can spam, or you take SMG's only so you can w-key, you should stop, pick up that pump, pick up that sniper. I did this for a week straight and saw so much improvement. My aim was getting better because it HAD to, my flick was getting better cause they HAD to. Try going for shots that you usually wouldn't (except you, trickshotters,) and practice them. I guarantee you will see improvement.

**Building**

This one isn't as complicated, just fight more. Creative is a great way to get better at builds. The way I've seen a ton of others improve is by getting flexed on over and over in creative. You learn to keep up, it's kind of like your aim where you are forced into keeping up. I've reached build speeds I never imagined I could reach (albeit not the fastest ever though). It's helped me a TON.

**Keybinds**

Don't use streamer keybinds, find what works for **YOU**.

**Postgame**

Don't get mad, I know, I know, easier said than done, but I assure you, this one's important. I changed my mentality. After dying to someone who was building a ton or W keying, I always think to myself ""What could I have done better"" and act on it. Everyone has their limits so I don't expect anyone to be super calm and collected after landing a 100% pellets on their head close quarters pump shot and doing 40, but I also don't expect people to blame the game every single time. If you really want to take this to the next level, start clipping your deaths, or recording games to see what you did wrong or right, and either fixing it or continuing it. 

**What if I don't have a good mouse with a ton of buttons, or I'm using a controller**

The same thing applies, everything you do is on you, not the input device. Sure a PC may have the advantage on a controller, but it's almost all about how good **YOU** are with your input. As for not having the latest and greatest gaming mouse, don't worry about it, find they keybinds that work best for you. Maybe even switch to a left-handed mouse. I know people that did that and felt much more comfortable with their game.

**Conclusion**
This is all I could think of for now. If you have anything else you would like me to add, drop it in the comments and ill make an edit or two to the main post. Let me know if you have questions, feel free to shoot me a DM, and don't be afraid to tell me what you disagree with. If anything listed above has helped you, let me know!",FortniteCompetitive

Now if I don't use a ball, I nearly run out of AR ammo by the fourth or fifth zone because there's no way to restock ammo from a dead body unless it's from a close shotgun fight. It doesn't make sense that whenever someone gets killed, every ball can just instantly catapult themselves towards the loot and reap the mats and ammo without exposing themselves at all. It makes it far less rewarding to take high ground late game because you probably won't even have enough ammo to shoot down at everyone else tunneling into zone.

(70-90 ping player).

Nearly impossible to take someone elses wall.

Get your wall taken 7/10 times.

Not sure about others, but I probably get 4-5 ghost shotgun hits per GAME.

5+ ghost AR/SMG shots per GAME.

Consistently get shot through your turbo building walls.

Tfue classic is extremely inconsistent.

Editing has a longer delay than everyone else (still has to confirm).

Players can pick a gun up before you.

Not 100% on this one, but I believe every shot you take, the player will be however much farther they can travel in the amount of ping you have (ms). This means that no shot can ever be truly accurate/ some shots that should be 132 or something would be more like 90.

Like I said, just kind of a silly rant post I just typed up because I’m so pissed me dying to my ping. The most discouraging part for me is that I know I could be quite a bit better. I did a few 1v1s with some guys with the “Pro” role in Atlantis cord, and won quite a few.

After seeing the sheer amount of money that one can earn just from getting a spot in the final, I psyched myself up into installing Fortnite. However, I'm worried that it is too late for me to get into the game and be good in time to compete for a qualifying spot (EU). Also, after watching the gameplay and practice of the like of Tfue, and how quick they are able to build such complex structures, it's fair to say that I should have thought about this a long time ago. Although if Epic do plan on something like this again for next year (with a similarly-sized prize pot), then that's encouragement enough for me to get grinding.

I can build fast enough but when I start pvp with a pump shotgun, for instance, my feeling is that the aim is moving too fast and I'm not really managing to target the enemy.

I find maybe 2 heals from my drop house (treehouse) or mountainside brick) if I'm lucky, kill about 5 people, and I always find myself without health and with only 200-400 mats. Like, this is obscene! How did people ever enjoy playing Fortnite a couple of months ago? It's not uncommon for me to go looking at poverty houses with only white health, and it's just so demotivating. Is it really not better to just drop at my arena spot and come out with actual gear to my name? 

It's so bad that in one game, I flew around poverty (no shields), then to Fatal to farm 1.5k materials. I'm actually being degraded to playing Farmville 2.0 early-access. 

I'm also getting mad frame drops, stutters, micro-freezes, delayed audio, and garbage performance that just makes me actually want to put my head to the books. I have a 1060, for reference, and Fortnite installed on my external SSD, which I bought at the beginning of S8 because the [graphics wouldn't load on drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aloh0q/why_is_this_a_thing_im_on_pc_btw/). For a bit, the SSD fixed the issue, but I've been getting that non-buffering business again tonight. This didn't happen for S3-S6, and I've been noticing performance drops since late S4. Actually ridiculous. I was considering getting a 144Hz monitor for this game, because I do love it, but ended up deciding against it because it was troublesome, and because there's no point investing in a game that's going to only display 3 frames out of a possible 144. I was in a moving circle with 3 people alive and was lagging (Pub. Basically no builds).

I read a comment somewhere (on Reddit), by an Epic employee, where they say they allocate server resources (Processing power? Idek) based on the likely number of people alive in said circles, and use those resources to process the game. Can anyone confirm if my memory serves me right? Couldn't they just give more processing power to competitive games? It probably isn't this simple, but goddamn...

For sweet baby Jesus' sake, they need to devote a season purely to server performance (not going to happen, ik...TT) and bring back some kind of reward for kills in Pubs. I'll take 25 HP and 100 mats, but I need a little something something to keep me going here. Fortnite's not going to die for a goddamn long time, but jeez, I really hope shows fatal signs soon, because too many peoples' heads are in their asses.

Read this.,"Disclaimer: There are a few reasons why you might be inconsistent (if such is the case). Here I will only be addressing one of the possible reasons, one which I think is likely one of the more prevalent reasons among players. In addition, I encourage you to check out a comment I made on a separate thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b99c3c/just_trying_to_cop_a_dub_so_i_can_get_that_season/ek355gc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) that covers an effective method to improving at your game in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always had days where I felt invincible and days where I felt like I couldn't even get more than a few kills in pubs. I looked at the evidence and gave it some thought.

According to my TRN Progress graph, I would fluctuate rapidly between low and high K/Ds on a regular basis. I could have a 5 K/D on one day and a 1.5 K/D the next, followed by a 3.5 K/D the day after that. There seemed to be a trend that after a really strong day of gaming, the next day would be one of my worst. From there, I would gradually creep back up to being on top of my game, before dropping off the deep end again.

So what could possibly explain this? Sure, the game has a significant component of RNG, but why is my inconsistency *so consistent?* **It has** ***little*** **to do with RNG and** ***everything*** **to do with managing your confidence.**

&amp;#x200B;

Recall a day that you were dropping players like it was nothing. What's going through your head? You're probably pretty pleased with yourself, perhaps even a bit surprised. You're having a ton of fun, and you're pushing every fight you can, battling good players without even a flinch.

Then comes the next day. You queue into a game, and get ready to slay out again... You die off spawn. So you call it bad luck or a warm-up. Next game, same idea. After a few failed matches, your confidence is shattered. You even feel your heart beating after what would have otherwise been the easiest elimination of your life. You're whiffing shots, taking massive amounts of damage, and just constantly putting yourself into horrible situations.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened? You found a groove one day, but the next you completely blow it.

***Overconfidence is to blame.*** When we're playing well, we have a tendency to assume that the fights had generally been easy. We forget about all of the *strategy, effort, and care* that went into that success. After a night's sleep, the only thing you remember is that you can play and win fights easily. It's that sort of empty overconfidence that inspires you to throw yourself at players before taking necessary precautions, such as acquiring shield, mats, or a shotgun. During fights, you aren't protecting yourself after taking shots and are expecting your opponent to miss all of their shots (because as far as you remember, this is supposed to be easy).

Eventually over time and through a subconscious series of trial and error, you've trained your game sense back to its prime along with a proportional amount of confidence. When this happens, you need to manage your confidence to break the cycle. For each gaming session, take every precaution. Don't take unnecessary risks. Expect the worst. Play confidently, not naively. Don't forget all of the lessons you've learned along the way of building up that confidence.

If you learn to do this, you should start to see serious improvements in your consistency.",FortniteCompetitive

As a console player i’ve played FPS games since WAYYY back in the day and the one thing i have mastered is my aim. I used to be Top 20 Na on Rainbow Six (game had no aim assist) i was on the top 100 of Destiny’s leaderboards for first months of the game, i played battlefield 4 and turned off aim assist because it would lock me to the enemies chests instead of their heads. Point is that i have experience when it comes to aiming and it translated extremely well into Fort since day 1. 

Now since i had the aim, i used to just pub stomp and carry friends for fun and i would play pop ups but never took them seriously until NOW.

I started grinding arena with one thing in mind: **Get to 200 and then W key all games**. My building got me out of the way but it was honestly not on par with Champs players so i wanted to just play and get in as many fights as i could so i could improve my Edits/Builds, this meant hot dropping Tilted and retail and Salty.

Keep in mind i play console, so when there were too many people my game would lag, i couldn’t use guns i had and a bunch of other glitches that make it impossible to survive the drop, but i did it anyways because i just wanted to get better and better. Last Thursday i felt comfortable enough with my mechanical ability (i was hitting multiple one pumps everygame, i was actually hitting edit shots on super fast players and i was just in the zone) So i started grinding and got from 215 to 250 in one day, Friday i died to Epic’s well designed game around 4 times and then i got triggered but kept playing so i was playing like trash, lost many points, but everything went back to normal on saturday. i got 2 wins in a row today and the second one pushed me to champs.

Endgame, they completely dominate due to how easily they destroy tons of builds. I'm gonna propose some nerfs.

* Rocket Launcher
Rocket speed reduced by 15%
Rocket can be shot and destroyed before hitting structures, exactly like the Guided Missile 
Damaged reduced from 116/121 to 107/111

The RPG is extremely strong in its current state, obliterating structures from range. With this nerf, the RPG's rocket can be shot down and the damage is less devastating.

* Grenade Launcher 
Removed rare rarity
Damaged reduced from 105/110 to 85/90
Removed floor loot and chest spawns, found in vending machines and supply drops only

The Grenade Launcher is super annoying, as it spams 6 'nades. With this change, the Grenade Launcher will do 20 less damage, meaning 3/6 grenades will have to hit you to kill you if you are at max health.  This allows the gun to still exceed at exploding structures while not being ask pesky.

* Boom Bow
Damage reduced from 105 to 100
""Critical hit"" damage removed
Ammo consumption increased from 1 to 4 (will use 4 bullets per shot)

The Boom Bow is way too strong in its current state as a sniper/explosive hybrid weapon. With this nerf, the item will eat up shell ammo quicker to balance out how it doesn't use rocket ammo. Damage is reduced to make the bow less powerful.

* Clingers
Damage reduced from 100 to 95
Will explode after 3 seconds, regardless if it touches the ground or not, exactly like grenades

Clingers prove to be very useful early game if the opponent has no shield. This change allows clingered enemies to survive the blast with 5 HP. The change to the explosion time makes it so enemies from extremely far distances can't hit your builds.

* Dynamite 
Max stack size reduced from 10 to 8
Blast radius decreased by 10%

Dynamite can be tedious to deal with. This nerf allows dynamite to still be effective, but requires the user to be closer to the enemy for them to do any damage.",FortniteCompetitive

Fov slider isn't the answer, they shouldn't have taken stretched in the first place. Now I know some of you might say it wasn't because of console while I agree, I believe it was a part of the decision, but being honest console can fuck off, there's little to no chance you can compete on it, controller players on pc is another story, console just has too many limitations (I'm not hating I use to be on Xbox, it's just the truth). Stretched was a good part of the game and every other competitive scene allowed it, I don't understand why they'd get rid of it and we all need to complain until it's brought back.

If you think that is too much and it wuold hurt the game, then I propose we still allow pickaxe damage, just nerfed to 10 per hit like it used to be.

Anybody on this sub knows that this is far from the truth, but if Tfue was ever oficially dethroned in that position, he would immediately lose a lot of his viewer base.  

And that brings us to yesterday...where Tfue complained over and over again about stream sniping.  

IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE STREAM SNIPED, DONT STREAM WITH NO FUCKING DELAY.... IT IS NOT HARD!!!!!!

Tfue is going to use stream sniping as an excuse if he doesn't qualify for worlds, but if he had any competitive integrity, he would just put a fucking delay on his stream.

Also, Tfue is starting to get away with things that Ninja never would have two months ago.  Ninja can't complain at all because he will get gangbanged by the community, but Tfue does it every fucking day and gets absolutely no hate for it.

If they want to keep this game alive after the World Cup they need to change the game to be more competitive. All they have to do is make the game way more fair and less rng, especially bloom. For bloom they should just remove it and have hard recoil patterns that are unique to each gun and we can master after some practice that way there’s a skill gap in gun play. Building and editing is fine it just needs to be refined. And loot, they have to make 100% chest spawn in arena and tourneys, there can’t be a reason why if I drop one game there’s a chance I won’t get a chest and have a bad load out half the game and die and then the next get a chest with grey ar that I already have from the room before. Chest should be 100% spawned and only give blue or higher because grey and green should not be coming from a chests. Also vehicles there shouldn’t be a reason why a vehicle is almost a must have if you want to survive, at first hearing baller won’t have weapons was a relive and then we play it and it’s a literal bubble shield that can outrun the storm cling on anything and boost. The quad and hover board are perfect examples of what vehicles should be like. Also Epic can’t cater the game to be as approachable as possible, nothing will ever satisfy everyone, you just have to cater to people who actually play the game and invest thousands of hours into it. Most of all, they have to fix the bugs and glitches, if the game can’t be polished then it’s not ready for competitive and everything should have a counter if there’s no counter then the specific action should require immense skill to achieve it. That’s just my two cents on the FN scene.",FortniteCompetitive

And this is my current arena rating on my alt. I played arena on this account to avoid tanking the stats on my main.: https://i.imgur.com/DjccVyC.png

&amp;nbsp;

I'm making this post because my previous guides were met with criticism on r/fortnitecompetitive and many people told me that my strategies would not work in arena. My road to champions could not have been easier. I won my first 12 arena matches in a row and maintained 80% win rate all the way to division 6. Once I reached division 6, I still got easy placement points every match. I believe I only lost points in 2 or 3 games the entire climb. Many people claimed that using the baller was not competitive and would only work in pubs. My experience was quite the opposite.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sure many of you are wondering what I had to do differently to succeed in arena. The answer is absolutely nothing. My gameplay did not change, even in the few games I tried out in champion league. I would estimate that I only had to build in roughly 10% of my games. The majority of my games were spent hiding in clever spots or zipping back and forth with the grappler faster than my opponents could track. I'm sure a lot of people will comment that it would be better for me to learn how to build and practice my aiming. My response is that it is better to practice both strategies. If you have the mechanical skill AND the strategic mindset of using brains over brawn, you will go much further. There have been a few threads about god tier W keyers in the qualifiers failing spectacularly in the finals.

&amp;nbsp;

The point I am trying to make is that you should be more open-minded. It is easy to hate on a strategy because it is ""low skill"", but in the end you need to game the system. If there was a hitscan gun that did 100 damage body shots, would you use it or would you claim that you'd rather get to champion league the ""real way"" since the gun will inevitably be nerfed? In typical Epic fashion, they've failed to significantly nerf the baller and the vehicle is still available to abuse. If Epic tripled placement points, would you still go for kills because ""camping is boring""? In a competition, you need to use every tool at your disposal and use the rules to your advantage. Even in pubs, I recognize that having 3000 mats gives an extreme advantage, so I spend the entire game farming. The point of a battle royale is to be the last man standing, by any means necessary.",FortniteCompetitive

Anyways, I have three general questions. First, to any of you who have switched from console to PC and are using a mid tier gpu (specifically I am looking into a 1060 6gb, 1070, or 980) how do the frame rates compare to console? Is a card of this caliber good enough to push 144 FPS early game on all low?

The second question is one that I honestly could find nothing about. This revolves around fortnite’s CPU usage. To keep decent frames (60ish) endgame, what sort of a CPU will I need? I honestly don’t know if endgame is more CPU intensive compared to mid and early game, and figured you guys would know better than me

Finally, given one of the three gpus above (they all preform fairly similarly) what CPU should I buy? Either specific models or a rough estimate of bench % from userbenchmark.

Thanks so much, I really appreciate any help you guys can give me",FortniteCompetitive

Starts at around 4:11:00.

Not sure if its intentional.

For all I know this Nittle guy could be really down on mats and needed the kill. But even so, I honestly have no idea why he tried to drag out the fight with builds and held Tfue out, instead of going all in for a quick kill when the zone is moving so fast.

By making dragging this out he makes sure that both him and Tfue will definitely die to the storm, no matter who takes the kill.

And this stupid play ended up possibly costing him a chance at qualifying for world cup. Kid is at 54 points by the end of all his matches.

By suiciding holding Tfue, he left a total of 7 placement points up for grabs, and possibly even more points from kills (granted he did get 1 point for killing Tfue).

If he had won he would most likely qualify for worlds at (he would have minimum 60pts, plus any extra pts from kills).

But he just had to make this stupid play.

But the appearances of them kinda devalue Fortnite as a legitimate sport, not to sound classist but they should wear some suits, Sundown looks like he just devours weed, like it’s chill to do it, but if you’ve ever watched well-respected sports like the NFL, or NBA, the announcers just look and act with surprisingly high class considering the average football fan is a drunken red neck. 

Like how the counter strike announcers for the majors are quite professional, wearing suits. Any thoughts on this? I think it could help Fortnite be more accepted and change the stigma that video games are for kids that just sit and home and eat Doritos while not maintaining a good appearance. Any thoughts? Sorry this was kinda a negative post, no offense to the casters just my honest thoughts.",FortniteCompetitive

-3rd game, i land haunted, edge of circle is all the way on the south side of loot lake. Kid that landed castle decides to push out to haunted as storm is closing, hits me with 6 stinks, i die to zone, as does he.

-4th game, not a shield to be found aside from the few mushroom spawns. Kid that landed at the 2 houses south of me managed to pull a rpg from the vending and a heavy sniper from a chest. Manages to kill me with one rpg.

I can accept dying when i made bad choices or just overall get outplayed, but shit like this sends me to tilt mode, especially when it happens over and over again.

Let's do a quick rundown of this weapon:

* can be found as floor and chest loot
* uses shotgun shells as ammo
* shows a GUI of the exact firing trajectory
* produces essentially no source noise
* projectile travels like a sniper bullet (i.e., it's quick and goes far)
* deals 115 damage for a body shot and 230 damage for a headshot
* *OR* just deals 100 explosive splash damage
* reloads in 1.6 seconds

What makes this combination of strengths so horrible is how *perfect* it is for third-partiers. All you need to do is locate someone rotating or in the middle of a fight, draw the bow, and place the blue dot near the feet of the unsuspecting enemy (or in their path if they're moving). *Uh oh, did you miss?* No problem. Your target still doesn't know where you are, and the bow's already reloaded.

What makes this so much worse than the heavy sniper is that it's so much easier to use and is extremely forgiving. The Heavy Sniper has no visual aid when firing, *has* to hit the player to deal damage, is possibly the single loudest weapon in the game, and has possibly the single longest reload time. The only good counter to a silent, long-range, explosive projectile-firing bow with training-wheels aim is perfect awareness while rotating and while fighting someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know *why* this is in the game: Epic is appealing to its casual playerbase by lowering the skill cap. But I think we need to make sure this complaint doesn't get put on the back burner.",FortniteCompetitive

Hello, so Fortnite been my first shooter that I ever played seriously, and I was playing it since season 2 - at first my aim were pretty trash, but I was playing 5+ hours every day spamming hotdrops and over time my aim improved, than I've started to look for a faster ways to improve my aim and found Aim Trainers - spend a decent amount of time there and my aim also improved.  


&amp;#x200B;

Well after that time I didn't feel like my aim noticeably improving despite I'm playing shooters every single day for like 5+ hours plus spending about 1 hours in aim trainers daily.  


**So here is a problem:**  
What I have now is a good aim that I don't feel I can improve any further, for example when I played aim trainer first I was making improvments daily - like in some exercise at the start my accuracy been 50% after few weeks of training it grew up to 70-80%. Now it's been about half of the year since that time and my accuacy still about 70-80% and nothing really changes.  


Also I feel like my aim right now mostly depends of my condition - when I feel sleepy/tired I hit like 70% accuracy, when I feel excelent I can hit may be 85% sometimes, but that's it.  


So does anyone know how to break that plato? Like some better aim exercises that can improve ur aim or something?

I think this is a problem with a lot of people who know that they’re good but feel like they can’t do well/ didn’t do as well as they know they can. 

When being w-keyed mindlessly you need to overcome that fear of being killed because regardless something will come out of it and play super aggressive back towards the aggressor, you need to basically put them into place and onto the defensive. Yes of course, you don’t want to die in a tournament game, but sometimes you will get someone who couldn’t care a less and will push you no matter the circumstances and picking out these players is easy, they usually aren’t the smartest of players,   and can easily be seen from a mile away.

But when I was watching his stream today I felt something was off. He was way more nervous than usual and as the chat recognized quickly his voice was different. After 7 games he even turned his facecam off. He was crazy w-keying all the time and didn't use game sense at all. Like he would have played pubs. Also, he took tags by opponents way more personal than he would do typically in a tournament. I am not used to a Sausage like this. He said his audio was off because his audio card was broken, but tbh I have another theory: Please listen to his normal voice:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbhfn-ZMl-A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbhfn-ZMl-A)

Compared to the Voice he had today:

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/410479880](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/410479880)

&amp;#x200B;

I really assume and I don't mean this in a bad way. Honestly I just don't want to witness a SausageM as today ever again. I have the theory he is a bit ashamed of his young voice and is normally using a voice changer. Today the voice changer didn't work and we could listen to his fine real voice. He realized this and tried to change something with the Audio all the time. He was apparently very nervous straight from the beginning (which he shouldn't for a semifinal) and this in my strong opinion led to a chain of reactions: Too aggressive/Ego Fights =&gt; Unnecessary Deaths =&gt; Low Points =&gt; more aggression =&gt; TILT =&gt; No Final for him.

&amp;#x200B;

SausageM if you read this: There is nothing wrong with your voice, you are 14 and we all had a high tone at this time. You are an Idol for a lot of these kids, if you show them to be proud of their own voice they will be too.

&amp;#x200B;

This might sound like a wacky hate troll post. But I think we gotta understand how big of a role model those young kids are nowadays.

I'm also going to be included more well known players.  This is also not just based on the best ranked players &amp; more so players that were surprising.  I know that this list is shit but I just wanted to share my opinion. Hopefully this gets a good amount of replies because I'd like to start a discussion.

1.SEN-Aspect. What a beast! I mean what else can I say. The man finished in 1st place with 94 fucking points. With 59 of those points because eliminations. Completely insane. May I also include the fact that he dropped a fucking 22 bomb, in the freaking World Cup QUALIFIERS. This man is playing the game like it's a PUB. As of right now, he's my favorite to win it all.

2.Liquid Vivid. To be honest, I don't really watch Vivid &amp; have never really payed attention to him. That's not to say that he's not an absolute monster, finishing with a god like 77 points &amp; 2nd place. As of right now, he's in a great position &amp; played his heart out today. 

3.NioRooch. Wow! Absolutely wow! Before today, I knew him only. as NickMercs' duo. Now, he's solidified himself as a top 15 player in the world, in my opinion. What a beast. He finished with 61 points. I really was not expecting this from him. Watching Nicks streams I knew him was good but I didn't know he'd be able to place fucking 12th. 

4.Tfue. The man himself. I personally think he did great. The no delay stream was a humongous risk that could've went absolutely terrible &amp; ruin his chance at qualifying. With no delay, I think he played as good as possible. He had a couple of throw away matches but still managed to come in 13th, with 61 points. Without a doubt, I could've seen him placing top 10 if he hadn't been streaming. Nonetheless, he did well.

5.Ghost Enzo. Ghost TF Up baby! With Ghost being my favorite team right now, I was ecstatic to see him place in the top 20, at 16th place with 60 points. He did freaking amazing &amp; had a hell of a day. I wasn't expecting him to place this high at all. One of my top sleeper picks so far.

6.Symfuhny. What the fuck. Literally nothing else to say tbh. I don't really know anything about Sym &amp; I always thought he was a LazarBeam type of player, who just fucks around, plays creative &amp; a bit of pubs. I was not expecting to see his name this high whatsoever. Congrats to Sym for placing 42nd &amp; finishing with 55 points.

[7.Ninja](https://7.Ninja). Are you fucking kidding me. Way to prove everyone wrong. With god-tier aim &amp; high IQ, he bulldozed his way to 55th place &amp; ended with 54 points. You can't tell me that you expected this. He's my favorite player from today because of the sole reason that he gets blatantly disrespected by this sub. Even though he probably won't win the cup, he did amazing today &amp; has proven that he really is a pro. Good shit man.

8.Ghost Innocents. He's proving me wrong man. I already knew he was an absolute monster but to be honest, I wasn't expecting him to qualify anywhere near where he did. Inno finished with 53 points &amp; placed 65th. He did great for his first major tournament &amp; I'm expecting great things from him in the future. He was very unlucky with his first game being a throwaway but he managed to come back.",FortniteCompetitive

**Tournament Points Appear to Be Reset to Zero**

Some players are seeing their scores appear to reset to zero, and will continue to see zero points after completing additional matches.  This is strictly a visual issue, and points are being tracked correctly on the leaderboard.

We’re still investigating this, but it will likely require the next patch release to fix.  In the meantime, resetting your game client will allow you to see your correct point total again.

**Some Victory Royales aren’t recording scores**

A very small amount of players are being affected by an issue where their points are not being recorded after winning a match.  This issue only affects the player who won the match, and these points will ***not*** show up on the leaderboard.

We’ve updated our backend to greatly reduce the likelihood of this happening further and will be continuing to monitor to see if the issue persists.

We do have access to these match results and will be making sure any resulting scores and qualifications are corrected prior to the start of the Finals.

I always felt like I needed to play Fortnite everyday for whatever reason. I was enjoying the game so much and I wanted to get better so I guess I just felt like I needed to play at least everyday. 

Realistically that wasn't a good approach because that took away from other things I could be doing. I thought iwas going pro or anything crazy like that but I still wanted to play so I could get better.

Unless you're a pro or a full time streamer, Fortnite should never be a priority. No video game should ever be a priority.  

But for the past couple months things have been pretty different.

I used to have playing Fortnite as basically part of my daily schedule which wasn't good at all. But now Fortnite is just something that I do on my free time and I feel zero obligation or persuasion to play the game. 

If I'm being honest, I'm thankful that this game has gotten boring and stale. 

Like I said, this game or any game should never be a priority unless you really have a future within it. 

Please don't waste your time. If you're not having fun,  don't stress yourself out to try and grind the game, it isn't worth YOUR time. Find other things to do that are going to be worth your time and be fun, rather than being annoyed and frustrated with Fortnite.

I'm not telling you how to use your time, that would be ridiculous, I just want you guys to enjoy your lives man. Theres sooooo much more to life than this dying game and we should explore those things, rather than allow this game to consume our time.

Just my 2 cents tho. Feel free to hate on this post and talk some shit :) or if you feel like being positive, i'm always down for some productive dialogue :))",FortniteCompetitive

That’s the question that’s been bugging me as I reach the wall of 293 points in arena. 

I’m not a champion league player. That’s okay. But now what? 

I have two options now:
1.	Go back to pubs and play a very slow paced game with no materials or health/shield on eliminations, facing average players with the occasional great player for kind of “boring wins” if I may be so bold. 
2.	Continue to play arena and *maybe* grind to the 300 mark for...what? Just to get massacred in the World Cup qualifiers? I play a lot man. I run through all the creative stuff posted on here. I watch all the videos and practice all the new techniques. I’m as good as I’m going to get at this game. 
3.	

Arena was fun at first. But now that I’m at the wall, i just don’t see a point in playing it any further. It’s not worth playing for health/shield on elimination because  at this point I’m not getting eliminations. It’s a camp fest and pushing a player is a suicide mission. 

Health/shield on elimination in pubs is pure, carefree fun. I loved the game so much then. Now, I feel like there really isn’t a place for me and other people that feel like they’re intermediate players.",FortniteCompetitive
458,captainblackknight,1555173358,bcscfq,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bcscfq/switch_from_console_pc_breakdown_worth_it/,1,Switch from console -&gt; PC (breakdown - worth it?),"Hey guys! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing you from my brand new custom built PC. Wife said we needed a desktop, I just tweaked the parts to be able to handle gaming. So I wanted to write a review of the change for anyone looking to potentially transition to PC gaming! 

&amp;#x200B;

**The build**:

&amp;#x200B;

Building a pc is fun and rewarding, albeit very confusing and complicated to the average joe. It took me and my wife about 3 hours from start to finish to put it all together and I recommend doing so. Now I have a good grasp on the parts, their function, and where to find them when I need to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

**The gameplay**:

&amp;#x200B;

The game play is like night and day. I consider myself fairly decent and I enjoy the comp games. I made champs league without the camping in balls BS. I enjoy the end game struggles. I enjoy fighting people with insane mechanical skills and learning from them. I was a console kid who thought I could prove people wrong and compete for some money somehow. I'm locked in to 75hz (gaming monitor limitations) but its a ***stable*** 75hz. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had it all - Xbox One X, Elite controller, gaming monitor, but the game just never felt consistent or smooth. The controls now are so responsive, the tracking and the shotgun fights are so much better, the builds are quick, and there's no guessing of whether or not you're going to have a frame drop when you try to peek the enemy and get lasered. The xbox one X was a *waste of money*. This gaming PC is like playing a whole different game, it feels much faster paced. My build is telling me I'm getting between 120-150 FPS but unfortunately until I upgrade my monitor I won't attain those frames. You can turn shadows off and actually see who you're trying to shoot in the build battle. The ability to track people in build battles and line up your shots smoothly and quickly is a massive difference maker by itself, compared to aiming at what you're pretty sure is a black knight in a dark build and hoping you don't have a lag spike as you do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**The enemy**:

&amp;#x200B;

The average console kid seems to be better than the average PC kid - partly in kind because the controller is easier to use and partly due to everyone being on the same hardware and everyone having the same struggles with the game. I have a small sample size thus far so this is just speculation *however* you run into Tfue's and Cloak's much more often. There have been players who are just so mechanically superior that you have to hope you have a third party coming soon if you want a chance to live. Or you die and watch as they go for their 20-bomb. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

* console is fun with the boys
* pc gaming is a real gaming experience
* the switch alone from xbox to PC made me go from 6/10 player to 6.9/10 player
* if you want to compete you should probably get on PC
* **it's worth it**

&amp;#x200B;

I can go into much more detail for anyone who is curious, but I just wanted to reaffirm that gaming on PC against console is like bringing a 25%-damage-through-builds-RPG to a pickaxe fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps someone who is contemplating taking the plunge! Because it's well worth it, especially since you'll have a PC for as long as you care to maintain it.

_____

Game as it is with:

No ballers

RPG nerf to 99 dmg

Heavy nerf to 149 dmg and only breaks wood

Tac 10 damage buff

150 mats go to inventory on kill

Get rid of the damn bow

^ can all be done super easily

As few bugs as possible

^ hard

Would be essentially perfect. I think the idea should be to minimize “unfairness” while keeping the RNG that is always present in battle royale games. Part of the fun is the fact that you always have a different loadout and you might be better equipped then someone else but further from circle or what not. It’s not fun to be guaranteed top 15 because you landed on the invulnerability vehicle and know how to sit in a 1x1 (me btw). 

The only thing to balance early game RNG I’d get behind is all chests spawn. Because when you loot a named location it’s common to land on a chest spawn, so that would at least give people a fighting chance. I think epic would have to look and say “names locations aren’t popular enough because people are scared of not getting anything in a whole house” (prolly true statement) and make the decision that way. 

Taking out rarities I’m totally against.
_____

In this comment I suggest that some of the weapons and items in the game are unbalanced (mostly the ones I listed), and that getting them isn’t just RNG but is pure unfairness. 

In addition, I mention that 100% chest spawns would be a good thing. Everyone deserves a weapon at the start if they land on a chest. However, the chances of getting a hunting rifle or grenade launchers right away help to incentivize passive landing away from other players. When you land next to someone looting should be hectic to try and find a better close range gun. Again, this is what I consider the “fun” subjective RNG. 

The same goes for rarities. Getting the better rarity weapons is a huge part of fortnite, and people love opening a chest and getting the gold version of their favorite gun. If you don’t raid enough places, you’re more likely to go into endgame with weaker rarities, so having them promotes looting and kills. Again, fun and subjective. 

Just wanted to try and get out my thoughts on which RNG we and Epic should focus on in order to make the best battle royale players shine. Fortnite needs its exciting randomness, even if it has cost us all early game fights. It doesn’t need end all combos like current rpg + heavy sniper or like baller + 1x1.",FortniteCompetitive

Not only in caotics endgames, but even in early/mid game.
My PC is not the best (it's a gaming laptop with 16gb ram, i7 6700hq and gtx 960m 4gb), but fps never drops lower than 70 and my ping is around 60
I was using 1448x1080 before the patch and, as everyone, I switched back to 1920x1080 but it feels very very laggy. If I put 1600x900 the game runs smoothly, but I barely see the enemies from medium distances. Also there isn't a lot of fps difference between the two resolutions.
I really don't know what can it be or how to fix that",FortniteCompetitive

I understand these qualifications aren’t perfect, but Epic’s main point of this World Cup is to allow an Open Tournament in which Anyone could compete &amp; walk away with big money. RNG was destined to play a factor in this tourney, i mean this is a Battle Royale, all past tourneys have had RNG in them to some capacity . 

The reason all these pro streamers are so vocal, is because they’re worried they won’t qualify and will not only miss out on big money, but may lose subs and/or clout they’ve received/won from some of the past invite only tourneys they got to be apart of

Yea they’re things like ballers that really shouldn’t be in comp, bugs still in the game that could fucked up ones chances, But is there really any game out there on the market not dealing with fixing bugs, or have features certain members of the community do not agrees with? 

Epic has always said this game would be forever evolving n shit, &amp; they will constantly be throwing millions of dollars into the competitive scene for years up to grabs for anyone who wants it. 

Most of these streamers really don’t want an inclusive pro/comp scene, because that means the status quo with pracords, invite only tourneys, and tougher competition from a wave of unknown Timmy’s is coming, and may steal parts their viewerbase (that enjoys watching comp FN) along with it...",FortniteCompetitive

When the Hand Cannon got buffed so it could one shot freshly built material, it was over powered but no one really noticed how crazy it was. 

Then people started to use it, pro player quickly adapted to it and were making amazing wall replaces. Then even bots started to use it.

It got to the point where it was absolutely abysmal to play against and so obnoxious.

This is exactly what the Boom Bow is going to do. At first it’s not so bad because people don’t understand how crazy it is, but eventually more people will start to use it and it’ll become an obnoxious weapon to play against.

The damage on it is insane.",FortniteCompetitive

FPS is so low that I can't even turn cant aim it sucks. Was 276pts in arena and now I can't play cuz of this issue. It is so weird because I play on stretched, which is now zoomed, which is already a disadvantage, it says I get 60+ frames but it feels like 10 fps. The only hope is to revert, which is probably not going to happen because epic hasn't been listening to the community. I realized when ninja came out to speak on the updates, epic still didn't pay any heed to him. If epic cant listen to ninja how can they listen to the community? Just going to grind until tier 100 in team rumble and then uninstall. anyways,  If you have any fps guides please tell me plz.",FortniteCompetitive

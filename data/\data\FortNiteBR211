We sent pictures back and forth and made comments about the lower half and how much we disliked the Levi's jeans he had on.

Just a few nights ago the Enforcer was brought up again, and jokingly we decided to pull up the skin for another laugh.  When we pulled up the skin he was wearing the knee pads .... I HAVE CLEAR MEMORIES OF HIM WITHOUT KNEE PADS.... thinking maybe it was a sneaky update from Epic or something, but after looking into it further because it was bothering us we found that it was released this way? Normally, I'd say whatever and leave it alone, they're just knee pads, right?  Well, the stars must've aligned and I stumbled across the Mandela Effect.  Which says ""false memories"" can in fact actually be dimensions shifting and changing (you may remember the Berenstain/Berenstein Bears dilemma).

Honestly, it's so ridiculous, but the memories I have are just TOO clear to be made up.  I'm honestly hoping even one person can say a similar experience happened to them.

Maybe we're crazy. It's starting to feel that way.

By wins you show how skilled you actually are at the game and thereby having no wins is just messed up. Come on epic, pc wins count, console wins count then why not mobile? And those of you saying mobile is very easy duh let me remind you that you are playing in the same platform, so you're up against mobile only. I know getting wins on mobile then showing on your pc literally bragging about how many wins you have isn't fair, so please do stats in mobile such that the Wins on mobile only counts on mobile, not on PC or on Console.

The runes are going to become energy-pit locations. When you jump into these volcano-type structures, you'll be spat back out from the energy water and equip your glider. This is why they're right next to multiple POIs, they also have a 30 second cooldown and will eventually loose all their cube energy after 5 uses. As you could assume, these volcanos are filled with something similar to Loot Lakes water and will not have the low-gravity field. These will replace rifts as they will be gone when Season 6 starts.



Tilted Towers will slowly be deconstructed during Season 5, where a wrecking ball will destroy the house that the cube knocked down. This wrecking ball will also destroy the clock tower, and then drive to Shifty Shafts and stay there for the remaining time of Season 6.



The cube energy in Loot Lake will stay there for the next 3 or so Seasons, with the POI getting a minor redesign every Season to keep it fresh.



Risky Reels will be replaced with a military base in Season 6, with uncontrollable tanks and huge stone walls surrounding the area. The tanks will slowly roll over to Tomato Temple and make it a classified area, by putting down walls and ""shoot on sight"" signs.



Wailing Woods will become a factory that specializes in taking wood, polishing it up, and selling it. Trucks will take the wood from Wailing Woods and use it to build the crossbeams for 2 new building in Tilted Towers, which are: *""Watch Tower""* (replaces clocktower) and *""Car Shop""* (which replaces the Merch Store).



The Battle Pass is apocalypse themed, with 3 characters being themed around Chemical Hazard Suits. The tier 100 skin will be female named ""Dark Bomber"" and have 4 different upgrades, it will also have very prominent animated textures similar to the cubes textures. ",FortNiteBR

While scrolling through the comments, **one idea that stood out to me was [this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8srec1/i_feel_like_if_fortnite_is_going_to_have_any_kind/e11wjg4/) from u/TeenageRampage:**


 *“Ive taken to making challanges for myself. The one im doing now is trying to get a win after landing in a square on the grid. So ie you initially land at pleasant and end up winning, you mark off that square as completed. There are a few you cannot physically land on, so just ignore those. But doing stuff like that keeps me engaged.”*



I immediately messaged my main duo partner and we were both stoked on the idea and excited to begin this challenge. [(Screenshot of our initial conversation)](https://imgur.com/csX9XoN)


**These are the guidelines we decided on together:**
We must both make our initial landing in the decided square on the map, and obtain the Victory Royale, either in duos, duo squads no fill, or select LTMs based on the difficulty to win (we counted 3 Score Royale wins). Tracking of wins and kills would be done on an Excel spreadsheet on my computer. On the Season 4-5 Fortnite map, from A1 to J10 there are 87 possible squares to land in. 

[**Here is the final spreadsheet recording each win and our kill counts**](https://imgur.com/a/vZBWAno)

I *(Z) finished with 331 kills* in winning games and my partner *(C) finished with 225*.
Some of our wins were before season 5 in Moisty Mire, and some were after the update in the new desert region of the map.

{Here are some progress pictures with dates](https://imgur.com/a/md7s44W)

We could have finished this in less time, but since we are both full time students with summer jobs, playing time was a bit limited for us.

A couple memorable wins: I10 no kill challenge, G8 our final victory, D10 (Z) was afk all game after we landed, (C) highest kills in a game was 8 from D8, (Z) highest kills in a game was 10 from D6 and F5.

**Shoutout to u/TeenageRampage for the great idea** which kept us busy for the past few months!

TL;DR: We won a game out of all 87 squares on the Fortnite map.

Season 1: The game was new and exciting. Nobody really knew what they were doing. Building was not very common.The map was completely different than now with many open vacant areas. Bush camping and hiding was meta for winning.

Season 2: This was the first time Epic implemented the battle pass. Skins started to become a little more flashier. A ton of new weapons and items like the boogie bomb, smoke grenades, mini shields, and silenced pistol. Ramp rushing became a little more common during this season. The double pump first started being used. The meta was camping in a 1x1, bush camping, or ramp rushing.

Season 3: Fortnite really blew up during this time. Ninja played with Drake, the comet almost blow up tilted, there was a lot of hype during this season. With the increased player count the servers had many issues. Building became a lot more common this season. The meta was outbuilding your opponent, spraying with the rpg, and going for one shots with the pump.

Season 4: Fortnite went through many changes this season. Epic wanted to get away from the ""just build"" method to win. Llamas, materials from chests, and walls were nerfed. C4's, Clingers, Mini Gun were buffed. The meta was holding splodes to counter building, running double shotgun, or shotgun, smg.

Season 5: Epic continued balancing the game like they did in season 4. Double shotgun was removed completely. P90 was introduced and then nerfed multiple times. The drum gun was vaulted. Summer Skrimish started this season and Epic was trying to tune competitive play. The meta was spray and pay with smg/drum

So we know that inside the cube was something/someone with same colour like a Drift's storm inside his suit.

My theory is that Drift's Dog from our world was teleported to dimension other than Drift and then got captured by someone and his Heart(or soul) was closed in the cube to find Drift.

Now explanations,I know it sounds stupid but i will try my best to prove it

Clue 1

Let's start from the beggining as Season 5 starts we get a trailer and right before Drift dissapears we hear Dog barking and we still don't know what happened to the dog and where he might be.Drift and Dog get teleported to two different worlds because after Drift dissapears we can still hear Dog barking.Drift is in Fortnite world but Dog gets teleported to the world where Enforcers live(or someone who wants to take control of the Fortnite world).They capture the Dog to use him to track Drift's location because ""Dog will always find his owner""

Clue 2

24 August 2018

Week 7 challenges were moved from thursday to friday,why?Because it is very important to show us Enforcers coming to the Fortnite world on Motel sign same day as Cube appears because after 7 weeks Drift's Dog finally finds his owner and now Enforcers know his location so they can get here to send Drift to our world but they don't do it immediately because they know that Drift can control Lightnings/Storm so they wait for the Cube to come and melt in Loot Lake.They put the dog in a container shaped like a cube because it is probably easiest to control him(or transport across the worlds)

Clue 3

Now we wait 26 days cube mowes and makes Runes and also leaves us hidden message in his path(Map from ""itsfiremonkey"" website)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jdumbry5pan11.png

He makes Runes because someone forced him to do it and it is not his will but he is able to create a shape of a dog on the map(East side of the map Dog's head,South his leg,West body and Loot Lake his heart location.Let's get to the next Clue

Clue 4

Cube gets in the water to change his Solid Form into a Liquid and now we have ""Bouncing Lake"" and we have another clue left by a Dog his next adopted form

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/s1ysax48pan11.png

and another one if you don't see it

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/m7pbf1mqpan11.png

So now we have to wait see a Dog creating his new form by using Look Late water and after that we will probably see Drift vsDog fight,as we know Cube was only hurting us if we shot at it so now when we shot at Dog so many times he sees us as an Enemy also he is influenced by the Runes so it will try to kill everyone on the Island to let Enforcers take control of Fortnite world and the only person capable of stoping him will be Drift,so be ready to see some serious fight between them.

I know my paint skills are awesome and noone will believe this but I don;t have power to close everyone in the cube and tell them what to believe like someone did to the poor Drift's dog",FortNiteBR

A meteor, Thanos, the visitor, the rocket launch, the rifts! 

Let me explain, I'm a causal player. I love this game. I lose a lot, die a ton, and I love each death just as much as the last. Mostly it's me making a mistake or bad move, a lot of time its the other person puts my skills to shame, and everyone once in a while in 50's, the lag gets me. I do not get upset at the game when I lose, ever. I just load into a new game, thumbs up the bus driver, and drop into a new exciting adventure. 

I have easily spent over 100 dollars in game. No complaints there either. I love the content, and have extra cash to buy it. Two of my best friends even bought cuddle team leader with me so we could be the ""Terrible Teddy Bear Trio"". My Buldgetron (aka Venterion) will always have a special place in my gaming memories. 

My disappointment started when the cube arrived. I love Kevin, dont get me wrong. A wonderful idea and game mechanic. I traveled the map with him, died near him, too him, and used him for a few kills. My issue was the lightning storm that started it. 

How cool it would have been to be playing in game when that happened! To have seen Kevin arrive! Instead of telling us, the community, anything, we had to hear about it after the fact because they planned it for the first day of the summer skirmish. No notifications, no hints on the home screen, nothing. We missed out on a one time event if we were, say, working on a Friday afternoon. 

That stung. I dont ask for much, or expect a ton. New meta? Bring it. Vault guns? I'll miss you. I never minded a single bit. I just love a good story, and want to feel like a part of the community.

Today they did it again. Kevin left. He sunk into the lake and wont ever come back. No notifications, no hints, nothing. 

So many times on this forum I have seen people ask for just this simple thing: Tell us when these things occur, we want to be included too. I'm not a kid, I have to work, I'll never be rich enough to stop working. But apparently its asking too much. I've seen people get trashed just for asking, even worse: No response from Epic. They just dont care about the casual players. 

Epic. I love your game, and I hope it goes on for a long time. I'll miss the fun times, but I can't keep giving money and time to a company that chooses to ignore such a simple request: Let the causal player be included in your universe too. 

I know most won't read this, let alone anyone at Epic, but if you did: So long, and thanks for all the llamas. ",FortNiteBR

In season 3 the meteor came and this started the actual storyline for Fortnite. In order to make a good story you can’t put random events that are cool but have no purpose really. The cube will do something but do you think they’re going to destroy or change the map before the new season. Just wait for a couple of days and plenty of hype will come I promise but until then it’s good Fortnite is actually making a story out of there game.,FortNiteBR

I don't think this will come back anytime soon, so I made a [FBR Time Played Calculator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMguEVfirGlbMC5iwzNZfymInIPF0T4D/view?usp=sharing). (Be prepared to be depressed)

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, enter your stats for solos, duos, and squads, then select during which Storm Shrink or Safe Zone period you typically place  respectively using the drop-down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shrink: Storm is actively shrinking

Safe Zone: Storm is not actively shrinking

&amp;#x200B;

The calculator then takes the average time to that safe zone or storm shrink zone and calculates the time played. ( I use [https://fortnitetracker.com/](https://fortnitetracker.com/) for stat tracking.)

&amp;#x200B;

So for example, for Solos I typically Win during Storm Shrink 7, Place Top 10 during Safe Zone 6, Place Top 25 in Safe Zone 4, and Place in Top 50 or worse in the first Storm Shrink. Over the 1799 solos matches I have played, this amounts to 385hrs or 16 days of play.  

&amp;#x200B;

For those who may ask, I do not include wins in top 10, Top 10 in Top 25, etc. Additionally, feel free to change the average times if you want to be more specific. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, this does not include LTMs or Playground sessions as this is not tracked on the websites.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy!

I have spent hundreds of dollars on skins and it would have really hurt to lose this account, but Two Factor Authentication saved my butt. I have since changed my password.

If you don't have two-factor auth on, it's really easy. Log on to Epicgames.com, go to Account &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Two-Factor Authentication and turn on one of the options. You'll also get the Boogie Down emote for free, in addition to your account being more secure.

I am just saying that they have reason to vault most of these.


In order from most to least likely (just my opinion):


1. SEMI-AUTO SNIPER

With the addition of the Heavy Sniper, this gun sees even less play than it did before (which wasn't a lot at all either). Most players prefer the Bolt/Heavy/Hunting Rifle to this gun and it seldom sees play. Epic has tried to buff it but to no avail. Very inconsistent and underwhelming weapon that I do not believe would be missed too dearly.


2. LMG

I personally feel like the LMG doesn't really have a place in FNBR. It's an extremely random weapon with an enormous magazine, but most SMGs are still preferred over it. It isn't taken most of the time and its random and somewhat spam-y nature feels a bit unnecessary. I wouldn't mind seeing this go. 


3. Remote Explosives

C4s have had quite a roller coaster ride, going from blatantly underpowered to extremely overpowered, and finally settling down where they are now. Although I feel like they are in a more balanced state than they were in the past, I wouldn't be surprised if Epic chose to vault them due to the fact that they're pretty hard to counter. 


4. The Bush

Although it's a phenomenal meme and classic part of Fortnite, I just think the Bush is picked up so little that it might need to hit the vault. Almost nobody uses it anymore (even newer players) and although it is a great part of FNBR history, I think it kind of taints the loot pool these days.


5. Minigun

A similar situation to the LMG, I feel Epic may remove this because it's just so anti-fun. It does make the user a pretty big target, but is still a really heavy spam weapon that is very anti-building. If I had to guess, I'd say that EITHER the minigun or LMG would go, but not both. 


6. Grenade Launcher

This will probably be the most controversial item on this list, but the Grenade Launcher has received a bit of backlash, especially as of late. Although personally I would not vault this weapon, I feel that Epic might. This is due to the fact that it's difficult to predict and quite tough to fight against. I seriously doubt Epic will remove it altogether, but I could see an explosive damage fall-off being added (or something of that nature).

&amp;#x200B;

This was over my mind for a long time, but I guess it was easier to complain, rather test and actually adress it. Probably safe to say that I was afraid that this would make me leave the game if it turned out to be true. 

As you all know with addition of turbo-build aka left click build meta, some people were blessing it, other were cursing it.

&amp;#x200B;

So as a player with 50 average ping (40-80), this is scenario that I run into daily. Please know that I have 3000+ wins and I played this game a ton. This shows my perspective on why these mechanics are broken.

&amp;#x200B;

First clip is a scenario where I am getting shot by a player with a lower ping. Player is from netherlands and has 15 ping on the clip. As you can see, I have 50 ping myself.

 [https://clips.twitch.tv/WildThirstyBisonPermaSmug](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildThirstyBisonPermaSmug)

&amp;#x200B;

Second clip is a scenario in reverse and as you can see, we didn't change lobby, we both used same gun and what a surprise, suddenly I turn into an unskilled player who cannot shoot.

 [https://clips.twitch.tv/MuddyFamousVelociraptorPunchTrees](https://clips.twitch.tv/MuddyFamousVelociraptorPunchTrees) 

&amp;#x200B;

Important info. I was pointed out that ""hey you don't move while building"" and other nonsense, I will adress it same way. If player A doesn't have to move, but I have to move (dodge and pray for rng to dodge a shot) then player A has unfair advantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
Please note that is likely scenario for vast majority of population in fortnite and this issue clearly needs to be adressed. It is impossible for a higher ping player to turtle or execute MOST of the tactics and scenarios that all the streamers and youtubers love to post. Here is a reason why it doesn't work for most of you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Epic Games for all new skins. Kappa

Here are some ways we can improve this.,"Your common counter-argument to proximity chat is **""I don't want to be micspammed by some 7 year old nearby""** or **""I dont want a random to hear my plans or my squad's ideas""**

&gt;1. There should be a keybind which automatically mutes anybody around you

&gt;2. Proximity chat should be in a Solo  gamemode. 

(You can have Reg solos or Prox Solos.)
If in squads, you would need a keybind to filter from speaking prox or party. That's why i'd prefer prox to stay in solos so you don't have to worry about this.

&gt;3. A user rating system.

 If you see a micspamming rando child running around near you, get the username above his head after the game and give him a negative rating. After a while of said child recieving constant negative reviews, he will be matchmade with other people, with terrible reviews. I.e Good Players matched with good players. Meh players matched with meh players. I've seen alot of games use this method and it profiting.

(Whenever someone speaks, a name pops up on their head, but only within 15m can you hear someone. Therefore nobody sees a name ontop of your head 100m away. If you're not directly looking at them, a small name on the left or right hand side can show up, showing their username.) 

&gt;4. * Age verification. *

Roblox has this. Children under 13 cannot type on roblox, and this proves effective quite a bit. Parents tend to sign up their children with the right credentials, I'm sure alot of 7 year olds have accounts with birthdays listed in the 80s.
By the age of 13, i think kids should be more wiser to not shit the bed when it comes to being a decent person in voice chat. 



Let me know what you think on how we can improve this idea, or what you disagree with. I think Proximity chat can really add replay value to this game when you want to chill and have odd or funny moments.

since you get 25 bonus tiers, you can get straight to Tier 26 (31 if you bought the BP for the earlier season), so that could save a shit ton of time to level up, both your battle pass, and your seasonal level, and also the upgradeable skins

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friends grinded the game so much, have over 200-300 wins with them. We loved the hell out of the game but since Season 5, I haven't been enjoying it at all.

For Season 4 I grinded everyday, Got Omega the moment it was available through tier progression, this season, I could've cared less. The desert was about the only thing that was fun but even then it got plain for me quickly. 

Nowadays I feel like Epic are trying to make their own game more appealing to those who aren't adjusted to the whole build meta or just aren't that good with it, which is good but, the reason people like this game so much is because of building. It's something we've never seen before, at least that's what I liked about it so much. What I mean my making it more appealing in accordance to building I'm talking about making C4 OP as hell, buffing the SMGs beyond belief, making walls weaker at initial build, incorporate a Grappler so that you don't have to build at all to get high ground. It's just things like this that make the game not fun to me anymore, because to me it's like, if you encounter any of this its almost pointless to even build. 

Idk, I love how incorporated Epic is into the game especially with the BR version, but another thing that gets on my nerves a bit is how fast they change everything and I also feel like they are doing too much and with quantity over quality that to me makes it a game that is just asking for more players rather than fixing problems that have been going on for a while now. 

I don't know if it's just a mental thing with me not having fun with a game I grinded day in and day out with my friends, but I can't bring myself to play more than one solo or duo or squad a day now without getting bored and wanting to go play something else. Anyone else feel this?

I would love to change the current email:(My Email) to this email:(His email). Please take care this is really important to me! tnx!”  Once I saw this I was very concerned, so I opened up Epic.  He had gotten enough access to change my username from mine to ‘iNq_Ninja.’.  I quickly tried to change it back, but there is a minimum amount of time you must wait to do so.  I looked back at my email, and say a confirmation email for my password being changed!  I looked over the security settings on the Epic website, change my password, and set up two factor authentication.  I have invested dozens of hours, and a fair amount of money into my account, so I really want to keep it.  What are my next steps?  Is there anything else I can do?  I tried email his address, but got no response.

But they fucked up so bad on the circle spawning algorithm that everyone hated on it for ""having to run to the storm circle all game"" which in turn they added a few weeks later a game mode specifically all about running away from the storm not even knowing where it will end up... 

Final fight was set up to where it mattered how many people were on your team at the end, so like a good 60-70% of players revived so much more often. And tbh teams of 20 and 12s were the best most balanced modes, as it was easier to not get 30-40 v 10'd and even if it was 40 v 10 it would be across multiple teams, allowing for a victory from any team. 

With as much mobility as we have in game now, it would be one of the best game modes to bring back. Players could land anywhere and just hop in an ATK, or rift out of area, Theres just so many options, and the meta is far different from the last time the LTM was around, so who knows how it would play out endgame? With all of new weapons and items, and addition of builder pro on console, It would be very interesting to see. 

But the fact was it mattered how many people you had endgame, as when the timer in final showdown happened, the team with the most players won.

I apologize if this is an opinion that is not shared by you, can we get some ideas and discussion about how this would (or wouldnt) be a good LTM to bring back. I personally, just really wish for final fight teams of 12s/or 20s to be brought back.",FortNiteBR

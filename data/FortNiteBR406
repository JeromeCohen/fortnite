⚠️- Some bugs can be really hurtful to the game 
though, the one where you can’t play with friends for example. But still...
people are complaining about the bugs so much, (me too) it got me thinking that how come there are so many more currently, than at any one time previously?

In my head I felt the answer was obvious, the most bugs came because of the biggest update (I think).

But why so many bugs,  I asked myself? Because Epic must have rushed their update. WHICH IM SO HAPPY THEY DID.

I’d 10000x over choose to have all these bugs but get to play on the new map than not have any bugs and be waiting more days/weeks playing on the old one.

So please management of epic(we all adore you), don’t think that updates should be processed and fixed for every little niche before getting released- especially if it will take a while! (Some bugs can actually improve the game! Ex ; rocket riding)

We fully trust you to fix any bugs if they do come up and should be removed.

 One of the major things that make FN so fantastic is the constant updating and feeling of exploring or playing in a new way! Which make the updates feel like rollercoasters and when we go by waiting for them it can sometimes feel like waiting in line.

Please Epic here my call, we love your updates- bugs and all.

Maybe it's time to stop adding more items, guns, maps, etc, and start working on fixing all the bugs in general and performance for the console users. 

It's not fair dropping on a gun first, picking it up, and not loading the gun till your enemy finds a gun and kills you with it.

Also not too fun when you try to switch building type to a ramp too quickly and instead build a floor or a wall in error because of a bug. 

Im considering buying the new Xbox one X just to see if it help with these issues, idk why the game is suddenly outgrowing the original 2013 xbox's, along with other games too.

We're used to waiting for weeks for small things to be fixed from other AAA developers. 

I see people saying that the game is in an unplayable state, that is hardly true on Xbox, maybe it's worse on PC but I've had no problems as of late, not including party issues. For those of you having problems with uncapped frame-rate on, try turning it off until it's better. 30 Fps is not unplayable, people don't seem to have an issue dealing with it on PUBG for console. 

Another thing, let's give updates a chance before we completely turn on them and riot. Mini Shields turned out alright, the Boogie Bomb turned out alright, the Chug Jug works great as the last healing item added to the game, and I'm sure Epic has a good way to balance the Mini-gun coming in the next update,  including the fixing of the bugs introduced in the last patch. 

Let's look on the bright side and realize that this update introduced a lot of good too. US West Coast servers were added. I'm in Hawaii so that's a relief, I've been rocking 130ms since release and now it's down to 65. CUT IN HALF!!! You won't have to see me lagging in your games anymore. This update also made building more responsive, however there is that bug that makes you place the wrong building type.

I trust Epic Games to make things right, they've promised us that much. Let's stop begging for ""Free Stuff"" too. I know you're entitled to whatever you want but cool it. They're probably pretty sick of listening to all these complaints while they try there hardest. 

Don't get me wrong there's a few issues, but it's been hours. Give them a while to wrinkle out some bugs. Anyway thanks for reading. Good Luck on the Victory Royales (:",FortNiteBR

The Chug Jug has been an awesome edition to the game, adding a different way of achieving full health and shields at the price of a single slot instead of multiple slots (allowing you to carry multiple forms of shield and health regenerators). While the time required to get the health is fair, for the positives that i just mentioned before - It does feel very bad to be rushed and killed or found while using it, since it makes you a sitting duck for 15 seconds. I think the Chug Jug should still heal for the amount it currently does, but do it over time. So if you've used it for 10 seconds out of the 15 and are low on health at least you've got a little extra health to work with. This would consume the item instantly, and lock you into the channel animation but make it interruptable by swapping weapons or moving.",FortNiteBR

At first, I thought the stuttering was happening when events were happening in the game (stuttering when the bus was on the map, then as soon as it leaves the map the stuttering stops, or stuttering starting when the storm is starting to move.)

Example: https://streamable.com/b3x8m

Then I realized it was more or less random, and more or less intense.

These are two examples of gunfights when it was particularly bad (one where I got lucky, the other where I didn't):

https://streamable.com/oqvqm

https://streamable.com/gjgjj

(The recordings are not f*cked, this is actually what happens in game, despite the fact that it says 100+ fps in the top right)

As you can see, I otherwise have no problem running the game in the high 100-200fps range, so I have absolutely no idea where this is coming from. I've restarted my PC too, with no difference.

I tried looking at the task manager while playing, and there was no difference in CPU or memory usage when it was stuttering or not. (comfortable 70%CPU and 60% memory).
The game also feels generally a lot more choppy, even without those stutters, way less smooth than it used to be.

Six days ago I linked my PSN account to an Epic Games account, and upon logging in to Fortnite on PS4 immediately after, I was level 1 with NONE of my $60 worth of purchases, including the Season 2 Premium Battle Pass.

-----

Six days ago I submitted a support ticket about the issue. It is ticket #1686488

Four days ago I reached out to six Epic employees regarding the issue in a Reddit comment.

Two days ago I sent EpicEricSW a direct message on Reddit relating to the issue.

This morning I sent MrPoPoTFS a direct message on Reddit on the issue.

-----

None of my attempts to contact Epic regarding my loss of EVERYTHING have been answered in any capacity to date.


In my original support ticket I included a screenshot of my account on the lobby screen at level 60 before I was reset, a screenshot of my account on the lobby screen at level 1 after I was reset, and screenshots of three receipts from the Playstation Store for my in-game purchases. [Here is a link to my Fortnite Epic Forums post on the same issue.](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bugs-issues/bug-reports/148026-ps4-purchases-and-progress-lost-upon-linking-to-epic-games-account) It contains the 5 aforementioned screenshots.


I have also created a short video that I uploaded to Youtube with footage from the day the new map update went live and older footage to demonstrate all the items I had purchased in the game that I am now without. In the video I sum the total value of all my cosmetic items in V-Bucks, and the total amount of V-Bucks purchased through the Playstation Store.

[Video Link Here](https://youtu.be/eOHPBWU_tZ8)


By the time of this post my account is almost level 30 and I have gotten 7 wins since I lost everything; which would put me at almost 50 wins had I not lost all progress and stats. I have not paid for any more V-Bucks since the incident so I have not received any experience bonuses to help get there, as I do not have my premium battle pass.


ANY response from an Epic employee would make me ecstatic. As I say in the video, I understand if it is too difficult or even impossible to retroactively restore my wins and stats. But it is 100% possible to credit my account with V-Bucks equal to the value of the cosmetics and Premium Battle Pass, which I have already paid for once.

Personally I think it's overpowered and a not fun to play against. Sure it takes some skill to get good at switching between pumps, but it also removes skill in terms of aiming because you can afford to miss your shots. 

Also, those without mouse buttons on the side are put at a heavy disadvantage since switching between pumps with keyboard is harder and clunkier.

I double pump myself to fight fire with fire, and the kills I get with it feel less rewarding, cheap. I miss the days where I would get sick pump headshot flicks. Now I'm forced to use double pump because I run into others doing it at least once every 3 games and it's ~~almost a guaranteed~~ a likely death unless I get double pump myself.

If it stays in the game then I'll use it more. If an Epic dev says they're planning on reworking it then I'll use only 1 pump until the patch comes.",FortNiteBR

The issue that I'm having is related to her CPU and GPU usage. GPU usage is low, as I play on mostly epic settings with post processing on low, shadows on medium, and antialiasing on medium.

The GPU usage changes accordingly if I mess with these settings, as it should. My CPU usage remains the same however, which is an astounding 100% at times, which causes stuttering/freezes until it drops back down into the 90's, which it never seems to stray from.

You are not guaranteed a full game out of beta.  The second they believe the game is no longer profitable and another project is more successful they will pull all development off said game and deem it a lost cause.
      
I loved Paragon and will no longer play Fortnite.  I've been lied to, promised a full release game that never 
came.  Paragon supposedly didn't have sustainable player base numbers but I never had to wait long for a match.  
If you do a google search Paragon is listed in the top list of M.O.B.A.s.  After two years they gave up on a genre 
that takes years to place a foothold.
      
I'm mad that the game is dead, but I'm furious I've been lied to.  They promised 2018 would be a good year for 
Paragon with many releases and the exit of beta.  Beware Fortnite players.  Don't believe any of the bs they will try 
to feed you in endless developer streams.  They make the game they want to and really could care less about your 
input.  They only want to appear as they're receptive to feedback. Beware.


TLDR;  Epic games lied to all Paragon players, not even fully releasing a game from beta many paid early access for.  They said 2018 would be a great year *wink* via a dev member, asked for input to save the game, and then cancelled it a week later......don't trust Epic in the dev streams or posts. Beware.

I didn't even feel successful after winning because I literally camped all game and got 2 easy kills which is not how I want to play. I could possibly win more by doing the same thing but I need kills to feel accomplished.

Picking the right drop spots. Be smart, don’t drop in tilted of you want to go for a win. I personally love anarchy, fatal and lonely lodge. The spots right underneath the path of the bus will almost always have more players there. Dropping in congested areas is great for practicing though. Expect high player congestion in tilted, pleasant and salty. 

2. Playing aggressively is the only way to improve. Camping in corners, in bushes and behind rocks may get you to a top 10 or top 5 situation, but you most likely won’t know what to do when you get into heated battles. You’re going to be going up against good players who’s sole goal is to first and foremost kill people on the ground and people with minimal cover. Think of yourself as a sitting duck with a giant target on your forehead if you’re camping. 

3. Filling your inventory slots with the correct items. In an ideal situation i run: an AR (full auto), a green pump unless i can get a purple tac, a bolt action sniper rifle, rockets grenades or a grenade launcher, and one type of healing (i usually like to run mini pots or large pots, med kits take too long to consume when you’re in battle and bandages frankly, suck) 

4. Build, build, build, build. Panic building is so important. The second you get shot, build 4 walls and a ramp, then figure out where the shots are coming from. DO NOT just spin around with no cover trying to figure out where you’re getting shot from, the other player already knows where you are. Late game building is important....once it gets down to the last 15-20 people, only build with brick and metal to counteract the inevitable explosive spam. Build 3 levels up to get height advantage. 3 levels is the max distance you can fall without taking damage. Always panic build with wood, it has the highest initial health and can take the most damage at first. 

5. Always have height advantage. Try and get on a hill when pushing on someone. Someone shooting down on you will always have an advantage and an easier chance at headshots. Line-of-sight players using trees and other forms of cover when approaching players in bases. 

6. Correct sensitivies. This is what i play on and it’s what works amazing for me. 

6

.65

7. Always have brick and wood available, i like to have minimum 200 of each. 

8. While using a full auto, unless you’re close range, tap your trigger instead of holding it down. The bloom will kill you if you hold down the trigger. Tap-firing gives you much greater accuracy overall.

2. New Grenade-Healing bomb- similar to a slurp, but it's blue, it heals for 10 over 15 seconds, and has a 2 tile radius for your team. But it also has a boost effect to where you can heal for 1.5 more (bandages do 23/24 health per one, Campfires do 75 total healing, etc)

3. Poison Gas Trap- It makes you have a poison effect for 10 seconds do 5 per second, but it's a wall only trap (add a campfire under it and it will set on fire, causing a burn effect for 10 damage per second)

4. Bomb Bow- Uses 10 wood and 1 rocket per shot and fires as fast as a sniper when fully pulled and does 175 if a headshot, 120 for a body shot, and 80 for splash. It would have a blue and purple rarity.",FortNiteBR

1) They are about to be in season 3 of a game with a fleshed out microtransaction shop that they STILL claim is Early Access.

2)They introduce many new bugs with all the new content they are pushing out because it is not thoroughly tested. Epic is just money grabbing on the craze of their game so they are taking shortcuts.

3) And worst of all, instead of MAJOR bug fixes, updates on what actual release game content will look like or ANYTHING with substance, the vast majority of their updates have been either microtransaction related OR introduced some new item that temporarily breaks the game.

Whenever there is a post about console building (probably one a day for the past 2 months) we get told they are looking into it and asking for more evidence. How much evidence do they need, do they not believe us? It’s been months and this has only gotten worse. And now with this new patch making it much much worse and affecting Pc players too it is on their radar. This sub is a giant Epic bukake and while mostly it is deserved I feel console players are left wondering when we will be able to play the game like it was intended because so far we are playing a game at 80%. I’m sure the downvotes will come in waves but I do love Epic and how they handle themselves I just wish they cared about console as much as they cared about PC. Between the two consoles I would bet we have more players than PC.

 Ark players were treated to weekly updates, constant developer interaction on reddit, and promises that everything would eventually work out, even during tough times. 

Fast Foward a year later, Ark is hanging on by a thread because the development team would not stop adding stuff to the game, even when players were crying out that enough was enough, but with each new add, brought more unsolvable problems to the game. There was a once a point in time where ark had more glitches than creatures (March 2017)!

Now I don't want to seem like I'm comparing Apples to Oranges. Studio Wildcard is a fraction of the company that Epic Games is. Which is why they should be held to a higher standard.

This is a F2P competitive shooter with a large player base. Everything I know, everything I've seen in gaming communities over 20 years of gaming (I'm 28) tells me this should be a toxic community. It's not though and I think Epic is why. Yup, this is going to be another post about how great Epic is.

Epic doesn't pretend to be perfect, all knowing, or always right. However they have been around long enough to know when they are. They take suggestions that make sense and ignore the ones that don't. They admit when they are wrong, I mean GENUINELY admit it, instead of half assed PR apologies or excuses. Hell, a dev literally came to Reddit to take responsibility for the junkyard crane not having collision... I've NEVER seen this. Did we bite the guys head off? No, we collectively decided ""Shit happens, thanks for looking into it so quickly."", And again I have NEVER seen that reaction from a community.

They treat us like we're adults. Other developers and publishers teat their players and customers like an unfortunate necessity at worse and needy, rebellious teenagers at best. Epic though treats us like adults who have a basic understanding of the video game industry. In turn we (mostly) behave like adults with a basic understanding of the video game industry. Fucking shocking, I know. Who would have guessed that players reflect how they are treated. 

Epic has made some of my favorite games over the years like Unreal Tournament 2004, the Gears of War franchise, and now Fortnite.

Here’s a list of what I and others have experienced so far.,"I play on PS4 and it is a pretty bad experience (bug wise) compared to PC, especially after the update. 

Pre-update bugs that are still in the game.

1. Will not pick up items after killing an enemy, or at the start of a match. This happens randomly. 

2. Cannot shoot your weapon at the start of a match sometimes. 

3. Opening a chest and trying to collect the loot but it keeps trying to open the chest. 

4. Lag delay when trying to build quick and loot quick.
 
5. Breaking down resources (especially hay stacks), there’s a delay after you destroy it before it actually disappears.

Post-update bugs encountered so far.

1. When building and trying to cycle to stairs, it glitches sometimes and will go back to the floor piece after cycling to stairs and other times it will show you have wall selected when you cycle to stairs but the stairs will actually be out.

2. Picking up weapons (for sure a shotgun) after killing enemies it will glitch out and keep reloading the weapon even after it’s at max or you’ve already reloaded it.  

I’m not trying to bitch, I love this game. But it’s very annoying playing with all these bugs especially the ones that haven’t been acknowledged yet but have been in the game for awhile. I just want the devs award of these issues. Please upvote for visibility. ",FortNiteBR

I've made a simple [AutoHotKey][0] script to do exactly that. Just save the script below as `FortniteHoldCrouch.ahk` and double click it with [AHK][0] installed! It needs to be restarted every system boot though.

    #IfWinActive, Fortnite
    {
        $LCtrl::
            Send {LCtrl}
            KeyWait, LCtrl

        $LCtrl Up::
            Send {LCtrl}
            Return
    }

You can go download AutoHotKey from the [official website downloads][1] or use this [direct installer][2] link for the easiest setup.

Additionally, there is a [compiled executable][3] that can be run independently. Here's a [gist][4] as well.

Firstly, from my experience it is only possible between PC/Mac and PS4 players, and not between PC/Mac and Xbox One, nor between the two console versions.

The PC/Mac user needs to send a friend request to the PS4 player’s Epic Games username which is usually just their PSN.

The PS4 user can only accept this friend request by getting on a computer, downloading the Epic Games Launcher, and signing in with the Epic Games Account that they use to play on PS4. Once logged in, the PS4 player can accept the friend request from the Launcher on the computer and then log out.

To play together, the PC/Mac users can “Join Party” with anyone they’re friends with on PS4 as long as they’re online and in lobby.

Note: the PS4 player cannot initiate the friend request nor invite/join the PC/Mac users.

Happy cross-platforming!",FortNiteBR

2. A segway you buy with v-bucks you can get out at any time. Especially helpful when getting away from the storm

3. You should be able to go to the GTA V military base and steal the jet and fly around killing everyone

4. Super shield potions that let you have more that 100 shields

5. A legendary and epic burst rifle that’s actually auto firing and 50 damage every hit

6. Building schematics so you can instantly have a fucking castle equipped with spike traps and multiple launch pads

7. Legendary Revolver. It’s hit scan and has a sniper scope (this could be auto firing too but might cause balancing issues)

Assuming you have a rifle, would your go to secondary be the pump, tac, or pistol?

The reason why I’m asking is because my go to is the tactical shotgun, but it’s very inconsistent with damage, one time it one shots, the next it’s 7 damage.

The pump is too slow for me and double pump isn’t really viable on console. Pretty difficult to use and really hard to land consistent shots on console. Well for me.

The silence pistol I’ve heard that the damage output is really great and the fact that it has a fast trigger makes it even more viable. With also a greater range it can really be pretty useful. However is there a downside to this? Does the silence pistol stand a chance against the pump and tac?

Another thing I want to mention is that the submachine guns in this game give high damage output really fast but burns through ammo just as fast. Can this weapon also be a meta option after the pump and tac? 

The reason why I’m starting this discussion is because the meta right now consists of the rifle and then a tac or pump. Which don’t get me wrong it’s fine and I don’t have a problem with it. But I wanna just hear your guy’s thoughts on if the other secondary weapons in the game can actually compete with the classic pump and tac.

Similar to PUBG, players can earn coins for completing matches, where the higher you get the more coins you get, same goes for kills. What if epic added this but instead of getting one piece of useless clothing we could work to unlock sets.

How it would work:
Each skin has 3-5 pieces required to get that specific piece and each time you open a box you get a random piece. I would say the blue items have 3, purple have 4, and legendary has 5. When a player has completed an item, they can no longer unbox duplicates for it. 

Loot box alternative:
Another idea ontop of this is the idea that this currency can be used to buy the pieces directly, but for much more than a lootbox would cost. That way if a player wanted a specific item they would work and save to get the desired item. 

Epic games perspective of releasing this:
Now of course the idea of them adding a way players can get the premium items for free would be pulling money away spent on vbucks but in my opinion players would feel compelled to play more based on how close they were to a desired item. 

Balancing and prices:
I dont have a clue how the prices for items would go, but i was thinking around ten to fifteen top twenty finishes would get enough coins for a lootbox, and these finishes would scale based on kills and final placement. 

Pros and cons:
Some pros and cons with this idea is that people will afk matches to get coins promoting slower play, but if that is the case then Epic can easily increase the coins for high kill amounts making it not as easy to earn coins for just sitting and doing nothing. This would promote more agressive play and bring more excitement into dropping into areas like towers or any of the other zones where many people drop because players would want to rack up as many kills as possible. 


I think an idea like this would bring a new reason to play the game and make it so players do not get burnt out so easily. With the lootboxes being kind of easy to obtain players would play around 10-15 games or until they got a lootbox, because playing a game or two and getting off means not as many rewards. 

Conclusion:
Many people like the premium skins but we don't have a very easy way of getting them except paying for them. I am interested in seeing your guyses thoughts on this idea, and feel free to critique it as much as you want. ",FortNiteBR

During some nights in the dorm I live on, everybody on my floor leaves their door open and we all play Fortnite in teams. While some of us have come close, none of us have actually managed to win a game (except for me, but I play on PC unlike the rest of my friends). Every night we keep coming back and keep trying to be the last man standing.

Well last night, one of my friends asked to play, so my other friend hands her the controller. This girl had never played Fortnite before. In fact, I doubt she had played much of any shooting game at all. She could barely even move and aim at the same time without confusing herself. When the match started, she floats down into some random shack in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, closes the door, and just sits there, too scared to leave.

Slowly, the number of players in the match starts to steadily decline as other players are eliminated. Somehow, the safe zone keeps zeroing down on her shack over and over again until finally, she's in the final 3 players just from sitting in this fucking shack the whole time. However, soon, her luck runs out and the safe zone goes somewhere outside of the shack she is camping in, leaving her with no choice but to make a run for it. At this point, she's seriously panicking because she's certain that she is going to get killed if she leaves. Then, in the wildest stroke of luck I've ever seen, the other two players get into a fight as the storm is closing in on her shack. One player kills the other, but he is left so damaged from the gunfight that he dies to the storm, leaving her as the winner.

Everybody watching her play literally screamed. Out of every possible location in the map, she happened to pick the one small shack that allowed her to win without needing to move or shoot anyone at all.

EDIT: [Best proof I could find](https://i.imgur.com/3Yv1zy8.jpg) from her snapchat story. This does not quite prove that this story is true, but in the top right you can see that she has 0 kills. She is standing just a few feet from the shack she camped in since the storm killed other person before she made any distance.",FortNiteBR

""During our downtime to upgrade to 2.3, we were performing recommended tasks to resolve a lingering database issue. Those tasks ended up causing the database to go into a bad state. After significant consideration, we decided our best option was to restore from a backup at the moment we took the servers down for the patch. Our first restore failed (due to issues unrelated with the quality of the backup) and we're working on a second attempt at the restore. We're on it and it will be up as soon as humanly possible.""

While we can't give you an ETA when the servers will be back, we can tell you that we will make this right in regards to any time you have lost today. We are sorry for the downtime. We hope to get you back to playing soon.

As an offensive or defensive tactic, dipping into the storm can be a valuable move.  Sometimes I get a kill and the person has just the item I need but it's all inaccessible due to my level of health and the fact that they're items are in the storm.  

Just a thought.  This could very well be something that has been brought up and shot down on numerous occasions.




I'm so thankful for this game.  It has gotten me through some depression issues over these past couple of months.  The community, generally, is a wonderful group as well.

I think the pump shotgun in itself is in a pretty good spot right now, being more difficult and risky to use, but also very rewarding. It would be really disappointing to see a blanket nerf to the pump in general just to bring down the power of the double pump.

If you had to re-cock them on switching back, using double pumps would still be an option in a similar fashion as double rockets or bolts, such that you would get 2 shots in quick succession, but then a longer delay for subsequent shots. They would probably still be somewhat viable, but I think this would bring their power down enough for the extra slot to become a serious consideration.

The biggest problem with the double pump, imo, is that it's very forgiving of mistakes, which goes against the concept of the pump shotgun. If you miss or just clip your enemy for ~50 dmg on your first few shots it doesn't matter because you can just continually shoot off up to 10 shots and eventually you'll connect. With a single pump if you miss 2 shots and can't disengage you're most likely dead, as it should be.

Each win gets you one victory point; they add a seasonal victory point shop with maybe a few items that you can unlock depending on your vp total. 

So maybe there's 3 gliders. One for 10 victory points, one for 25 and one for 100. (Just an example; could be a glider, skin and dance emote.. just some kind of items) 

This will give us the incentive for wins without adding the incentive for cheating to the extent that there's a limit. 

Also: I think it would be awesome to add custom emotes for certain items we buy in the shop. So for example with the Party Animal Pickaxe - you can pour out some slurp.   You can get creative with it. 

Edit:  *instead - whoops.

Edit: So I guess i wasn't clear in terms of the incentive for cheating if this were to be implemented.  I was trying to say adding this would have a lot less incentive over adding v-bucks.

434,AnxietyRx,1516906342,7syc5d,27,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7syc5d/vbucks_reward_system/,0,V-Bucks Reward System,"The cosmetic items in this game are very well made and great looking, but most of them are expensive. For the amount of money that V-Bucks cost I think the items in the item shop are a bit overpriced. I know that its a Free-to-Play game and they need to make money, I myself have no problem spending $10 for the Battle Pass because this game is definitely worth some money here and there but with the very small amount of V-Bucks you can get without buying them and the prices of the items there needs to be other ways to earn them.

Here are my thoughts on some potential ways to earn them through playing Battle Royale:

1. **Victory Royale Rewards**:
I've heard this from other people as well and think its a pretty solid idea. For every win you would receive however many V-Bucks Epic would decide is fair. Maybe somewhere from 5-10. This still isn't a lot considering items cost 800-2000, so hopefully it would be more than that. Now there are players who are very good at this game and win often so they could potentially rack up a decent amount of V-Bucks throughout the day. One possible way to combat this would be to either put a limit on how many wins per day are available for rewards, or maybe after a certain amount of wins, such as 10 daily wins for example the amount of V-Bucks gets dramatically reduced, lets say from 20 per win down to 5.

2. **Weekly Challenges**
This idea I think is perfect and makes enough sense that they may already be working on something similar. We already have daily challenges so why not weekly challenges? These challenges would offer V-Bucks as rewards. Obviously they would need to make them pretty difficult and/or require a lot of time to complete. There are a lot of ways they could approach this, one example could possibly be get 50 Kills with ARs, 30 Kills with shotguns, and 20 Kills with pistols. This is just a random example, I dont know if people would like that specific challenge or if the kill requirements should be higher but just something that would require at least 5-7 days to complete for people who play maybe a couple hours a day. Like i said hopefully Epic is already working on some time of weekly challenge system because I think that everybody would like more rewards, hopefully if they do the reward would be V-Bucks.

There definitely are more options but these are my top two. Like I said I understand they need to make money and I myself like the game enough to occasionally spend money to support it, but I think its common consensus that the prices of V-Bucks and the price of items in the shop are a little bit overpriced, especially for how much content they push out.

**TL;DR:**
V-Bucks are expensive and items are a bit overpriced so alternative ways of earning them in Battle Royale such as a reward system for wins and/or weekly challenges would be great for those who don't want to money every time they want an item. I know its a Free-to-Play game but with how many people play it and how many people buy V-Bucks already I doubt it would be a big hit to them financially to offer ways to earn them in-game.",FortNiteBR

Noticed he put in 667 hours so I decided to do a little number crunch.,"Under the assumption that he started playing on the very first day BR came out (September 26, 2017) this is what 667 hours looks like.

-120.5 days since the release of BR
-2,892 total hours since the release of BR
-964 hours of sleep (under the assumption Myth gets his full 8 hours)
-1928 waking hours
-667 hours played
-35% of waking hours spent playing BR

Which equates to.. *drumroll please*..

-**5.5 hours a day playing BR**

Again, that’s under the assumption that he started playing BR on September 26, 2017 and gets his full 8 hours of sleep.

I don’t know anything about this guy, but damn is that impressive.

Let's say: A classic Arena shooter TDM. And maybe some other mode like Capture the Flag, King of the Hill?

Would you like them? Would it be possible to see it in the future?

I think it would fairly easy to develop and it would be a fresh alternative to Battle royal every now and then!

Thoughts?

Edit:  More details;

 Ok probably I didn’t give you more details; just imagine this for a second;

When you open Fortnite you have;
Save the world 
Battle royal

And Arena;

What is it? 

2 teams, 10 each.

Levels are the same as BR.

No loadouts, everyone starts with a common pistol and a common pump shotgun.

Power weapons (Scar/RPG/ Grande launcher and so on) are scattered through the map

Map: just a small circle, big as a town let’s say Greasy grove for example 

No respawns but 5 rounds

Storms gets smaller when 4 or less players remain.

However whenever I play duo or higher, I always go against people who just go crazy and build massive stairs above me and drop down on me, double-pumping me to death before I can react. Even when I know someone is building stairs to me, I have no idea what to do, and I usually always die to it. I sometimes try to just shoot the stairs down but that's usually the biggest mistake I find and I just die with no retaliation.

  New to the sub and the game and it seems like my burst rifle fire rate is much slower than when others are using the burst.  Is there a trick to get it to fire quicker, or is it based on the rarity of the item how fast it fires?

I have happily picked up Green burst fires in the past, however, my hands and eyes were blessed to see the all mighty (and extremely rare) blue burst fire recently and oh my, how I love that gun. It deserves so much more respect in my opinion. I love this gun so much that I have gave my friends scars (rare &amp; legendary) just because I cannot let this beautiful gun leave my side as it has led me to multiple victories. 

My believe that the FortNite Devs have realised that the Blue Burst is so mighty and powerful that have been forced to make it mythical and not inform anyone causing us Burst enthusiasts to go on a never ending hunt. And honestly I am okay with that. I just wish I could see it slightly more often 

The Blue Burst Fire is not a force to be reckoned with. We shall meet again maybe in a chest but hopefully from a fallen player that we have slain with a common burst because they do not know the way of the burst. 




Has anyone else noticed the rarity of the blue burst or is it just me? Also what is your favourite gun in the game so far? Would be cool to see everyone’s opinions

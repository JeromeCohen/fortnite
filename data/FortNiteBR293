Assuming that’s what happens, I have one big idea and a couple minor theories:

BIG idea: the map in season 5 will be changed, not the physical layout, but the contents. Different areas could be different time periods even.

1st: why the fancy new soccer stadium? I know it’s supposed to be for the World Cup, at least that’s what they say, but there were already plenty of soccer fields. I think they update the stadium into a Roman gladiator type arena.

2nd: shopping carts are now chariots. Chariot battles in the arena.

3rd: Something in the south west corner that used to be there before sinking into the sea.

4th. I really feel like we’ll see a pyramid or two. How cool would it be to have a desert with all the Egyptian themed decorations where Wailing is, and a massive pyramid in the middle

5th. A Wild West section, watch out, there’s a 5% higher chance that the floor loot will be a revolver.

6th. Medieval castle/village where Tilted is.

Etc.

What do you hope to see in season 5?

Feel free to discuss if you think otherwise about anything, and sorry there will be a lot of reading in this thread!

Before Season 4:
A comet appears in the sky above Tilted Towers, what will happen when it strikes?

Season 4 Beginning:
The comet ends up hitting Dusty Depot, thus creating a new POI name Dusty Divot. A new type of object ‘Hop Rocks’ have appeared following the comet’s impact. This new POI includes a research facility dedicated to the impact of the comet. Scientists and the government end up drilling into the comet for their research project.

Season 4: Week 2+
After the facility is finished and ready to begin with operations regarding the comet, they start drilling into the comet and parts of a metallic object is seen through the cracks, what will be uncovered in the following weeks?

The map ends up being patched up following the impact as certain locations were struck by debris and destroyed partially.

Trucks carrying «hop rocks» and metallic rocks (fragments of the initial comet) are driving towards a new mountain base near Snobby Shores (referred to as the Villain’s Lair)

A movie set is rumored to have been set up by the government to cover up all of the stuff inside of Dusty Divot and the «incident». This «movie» will be filmed until the situation gets out of control.

TAKE NOTE: Carbide and Omega are REAL characters, the directors for know this and sets up a superhero movie, but is on a BUDGET (hence why the week 6 screen shows an unarmored Omega and Carbide, which are the actors).
IN SHORT: The real Carbide and Omega has their armor equipped, whilst the actors do not since they are on a low budget.

Season 4: Week 4-6
Repeated drilling into the comet clearly unveils that some sort of pod containing something (or somebody) is inside of the comet. 

Map is still being patched up, trucks are still carrying hop rocks and fragments of the comet. Hop rocks and fragments have appeared inside of the Villain’s Lair near Snobby Shores.

Season 4: Week 7
The comet being in a «weak» state after many drilling attempts, let’s The Visitor break through and escape from the facility through force. The entire «The Visitor» situation is now outside of the government’s hands and is on the loose. The  cover-up movie supposedly comes to a stop, as there is no reason to cover it up anymore. 

The facility in Dusty Divot is now abandoned. It is unknown if the government or whoever ran the research facility is still involved in the situation.

Season 4: Week 8
The Visitor discovers the rocket at the Villain’s Lair and develops and escape plan. Over a period of time, he modifies the rocket to an extent where it is able to travel through time and space itself. The escape plan is to be executed on the 30th of June, 2018 after leaks occur.

Various changes happen to the map as well during the time The Visitor modifies the rocket;
Tilted Towers includes a new building, Dusty Divot is close to being overgrown completely, the truck convoys are still on their way to their destination.

Season 4: Week 9 - The Blast-Off Event
The Visitor is ready to make his escape. The plan will be executed on June 30th, 2018 at 7:30 PM CET. Countdown timers on the in-game TV’s are broadcasted until this event takes place.

The «Blast-Off» event happens at said time, and The Visitor escapes the world of Fortnite Battle Royale.

It begins with the rocket launch sequence, which also leaves thrusters falling down into Anarchy Acres. After the rocket reaches it’s peak height, The Visitor is heard setting co-ordinates for the rocket’s flight path in order to gain enough momentum and speed to travel through time and space itself. 

NOTE: These co-ordinates are actually tiles on the map in Moisty Mire and on a mountain near Greasy Grove, and these tiles mark where wormholes will appear for the rocket to go through. Many people speculated upon the audio files and co-ordinates being leaked that Moisty Mire would be destroyed as the co-ordinates were located there, but they are actually showing the location of where wormholes would appear.

The rocket after setting co-ordinates to mark the flight path ends up targeting Tilted Towers with lazers to mark the first wormhole location, almost making it look like the rocket would destroy Tilted. After travelling through the first wormhole above Tilted and into the space-time continuum (possibly to another dimension), he exits through a new wormhole created above Moisty Mire and flies around the map to disappear into an exit near a mountain in Greasy Grove. As the rocket flies across the map, small rifts in time are made in locations such as Lonely Lodge. This also marks the end of his flight path, as The Visitor comes through a charged wormhole above Loot Lake, speeding up into the sky fast enough to travel through time.

There is one problem with this, however... as The Visitor travelled through time, he created a huge crack in the space-time continuum (BR is not located inside of a dome, as some people think). 

What happens after this Blast-Off event is unknown at the time and can only be speculated, but we’ll know soon! We’re all curious to see what the huge rift in the sky will do!

Damn, it took so long to write this, but I’m proud. If anything is proven wrong, I’ll edit the thread! Thanks if you actually read the entire thing!

*wait what?* they say.

Alpha was not in the rocket. If you look at the tip of the rocket, there is no window or anything, it’s completely sealed. Want to know what he was trying to do?

The first part of the plan was to get the rocket to a high enough point, so that it could gain enough speed to hit and enter point 1 (above tilted).

When the rocket hit point 1, it entered it, and pinged to Point 2 (above moisty). Point 2 shot the rocket out, let the rocket gain speed by flying across the map, allowing it to hit and enter point 3. Point 3 led to point 4, which was the most powerful point.

Now, this is where it gets interesting, keep along.

Point 4 was the most powerful point, the space around it bends much more, and there is way more electricity. When the rocket comes out of point 4, it boosts itself, towards the sky.

Remember how everyone said it was a missle? Well it was.

The rocket had to much speed and energy, that it was able to make its own point, Point V.

Now, the rocket wasn’t just entering the Point V, it had some type of futuristic explosion, so advance, that instead of having a simple omg effect, like the other points, it was enough to keep Point V open.

So the missle is gone, what about Alpha?

Alpha didn’t just want fireworks. He’s a “visitor”. He opened a Point, without anywhere to ping to. Point V isn’t just a portal, it’s a time machine. And not only does it travel to the past, but to the future. 

And Alpha is from the future. And he isn’t alone.",FortNiteBR

It was taken down within an hour but he did say that season 5 will consist of a new map with a desert themed landscape. There will be ravines and volcanoes on the new map and the big crack right now will be used to get there. He also confirmed that season 5 will be history themed with skins coming from different points of history. I’m pretty sure the post was legit but take it with a grain of salt. ,FortNiteBR

First, I don't know if anyone hasn't seen what happened by now, but just in case, give this awesome video u/enzait made here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8v4gy1/i_just_made_an_epic_cinematic_of_the_rocket/

So.  The Visitor is not a movie character, but something unknown.  This has been known for a while, but I am establishing details.  He is seen modifying the rocket that was originally for the movie in this loading screen: https://fortnite.gamepedia.com/Retrofit_(loading_screen).  With intentions unknown, the Visitor launches the rocket, with a booster falling to Anarchy Acres.  Then, we get to the good stuff.  Right as the lasers zeroed in on Tilted Towers, the initial thought was that Tilted was done for.  But then, a giant electrical charge appeared, and the rocket disappeared into it, reappearing over Moisty Mire coming out of another giant electrical... thing.  However, before charging at Tilted Towers, you can hear audio of someone talking.  The Visitor? Presumably.  Here is a post by u/Fizzypug made, which is the best version of that audio I could find:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8v3rhq/what_do_you_think_the_voice_is_saying/

What u/smellyanoose (wonderful name) heard was, ""Zero-point oscillator on, set coordinates, engaging multi-fueled accelerator.""

This was further proved to be what he said when u/bootsvdb responded saying,

This is it boyz!

Zero-Point Wikipedia: Zero-point energy (ZPE) or ground state energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have.

Oscillator: a device for generating oscillating electric currents or voltages by nonmechanical means.

This is it, Give this man his upvotes.""

I am no quantum physicist, but what I hear is energy, quantum physics, and a multi-fueled accelerator.  There are 4 booster rockets strapped to the side of the rocket, so that explains why it is multi-fueled.  

This brings us to the last part of this theory (although this has been more of a compilation of everything that we have learned so far).  This was done to create a large amount of energy, enough to create a wormhole.  This is one source I found on wormholes:  https://www.space.com/20881-wormholes.html.  There are a few lines that are important here.  First, that they are unstable, and second, that they are used for traveling large distances without taking a straight line, and this third one is heavily debated, but some believe that time travel to the past is possible with their use.

Ok.  Now, what this all means.

Where was the Visitor trying to go? Or.. when was he trying to go?  Home, or is he from the future and is returning.  Maybe he has been cryogenically frozen in his capsule, and wants to return to his planet or time?  It is hard to know as of right now, and only time will tell.

I promised a TL;DR, so here you go.

The rocket went through portals that could either be through time or space, maybe both.  Why the Visitor wanted this is unknown, maybe he wanted to get home before dinner to get some of his mom's spaghetti.",FortNiteBR

Pretty decent, imo. This AFK method helps because I hated having to play the game way more than I wanted to which was quite stressful.

My Method: 

1. Go in to solos.

2. Jump out of the bus once it reaches the middle of the map, immediately pull your glider. 

3. Wait the ~1:20 until the bus leaves and the first circle appears. 

4. Go to middle of the first circle then hide in a bush. You will be able to make it to top 10 without moving and receive that 744 XP (with the 120% Battle Pass bonus) for doing absolutely nothing. But know with the bonus 100% you get nearly 1,000 XP per game! *Make sure you make it to top 10.* 

I’ve been doing this over and over from R-Play (paid, third party remote-play app for iPhone) on my phone. I could probably do this more often if I had mobile but unfortunately my phone isn’t compatible.

Note: 

-There is no harm in going AFK as this does not get you banned, imagine comparing this to bush camping without looting.

- If you care about your KDR this AFK method isn’t for you.

- Kills only give you minimum 6 XP but 50 for getting one period.

- If you are level 70, with ~10 days left in the season, this should be a breeze with only one level to do every day.

- There have been many mentions from folk, that they were able to easily get those cheesy wins from this so if you need those wins and that bonus XP, go ahead and loot up and win that game!",FortNiteBR

Think about it, the island is an experiment, a test to see what happens in the fortnite scenario if you will.

This theory would explain the srange colouring of the crack (NSFW). 
It would explain why it is seemingly just a crack in ”the sky” (the forcefield is invisible).
It would explain why you can’t move pass a certain point(X&amp;Y).

This is just a theory but it’s probably the most plausible theory we’ve got, please tell me your thoughts in the comments.

The rocket followed a path along the east of the map and took a 180, heading for greasy grove.

Now take a look at this trailer epic recently posted: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g5PeLQmYOYk

First off lets look at Moisty Mire, we see a wormhole open up here and in this trailer there is a western theme. Which could foreshadow a convergence happening that leads to a real western town being incorporated.

The rocket then heads north and circles around  Anarchy Acres and a the rocket booster also landed here. In the trailer we see players built a pyramid and the sphinx, possibly foreshadowing an Egyptian area.

We also see another pyramid below the area the wormhole opened near greasy grove.

The trailer also shows a medieval castle built in the water valley that runs from Loot Lake to the north of the map. Therefore the wormhole above loot lake could possibly become a medieval castle due to large body of water becoming an effective moat for a castle which may replace the house in the centre.

As for Tilted Towers, this is a matter of pure speculation. But the mostly likely periodic theme would be a noir-detective style city. Or alternatively a futuristic area, inspired by the likes of Blade Runner. Of course there are many other possibilities.",FortNiteBR

This is also a lesson of why physics and chemistry are 2 very important things.

Theory 1: It's a reaction between gases in the atmosphere. 

Now, this means that the crack is a temporary site to see, but it very well may be this. As you can see, there is a supernova-y part of the crack on the edges of it, I say this because this is basically exactly what gas and dust looks like from supernova explosions. While holes in the atmosphere are unseeable unless you have a high tech telescope, this is definitely a possibility. Now, you might be wondering why it's there for a long time, and that's because it's probably a chemical reaction. Chemical reactions, as much as you can see atleast, are visual and happen over a period of time.

tldr; we're playing inside of the omen pickaxe orb + the fate backbling orb; purple cracks, purple effects from the cracks, storm

what are your thoughts??

Say what you will, but he spawned into a game expecting to play it. I’m betting he knew he could pull this off. The event was a perfect storm; everyone is going to have their guard down, they’re not going to be expecting someone to massacre all of them.

While other players used skill and tactics, this person gamed the system to secure the most legendary game in Fortnite (so far).

However, we shouldn’t be discounting this record simply because of the circumstance. With this event having taken place, we can almost certainly expect new events to happen, allowing for much more skilled players to eventually overtake that record and become the new holders.

My prediction? Streamers and the best players will be see this opportunity and try to capitalize on it; we might see more community driven events being crashed, and official events being played in order to achieve the record. This event has sent a precedent that will most likely be used to beat the record, however long it may take.

That’s why, this record is so important. It arguably changes the game of achieving the record.

Now, why am I telling you this? Here’s why: I’ve been a gamer since we got the original Gameboy in 1994. I’ve made so many memories playing, Mario and Pokemon as a kid, having halo lan parties in middle school, fishing for lobsters in Runescape while doing homework in highschool, making (and losing) friends playing smash bros melee in college, making a whole community of friends playing Paragon (RIP), through becoming a mod of /r/paragon, and then learning about a new version of Fortnite coming out and becoming a founding moderator of this amazing community: /r/FortniteBR. 

What’s going on right now is special. These days are the good old days.

I was up last night until 4am holding my newborn son. He’s 10 days old. He wasn’t supposed to survive birth. He is an identical twin but his brother died in the womb 9 weeks ago and he suffered a massive stroke as a result. When my wife went into premature labor we didn’t think he would even be able to breathe, but here his is. When you think you won’t get any time at all, every day of the last 10 days has been a gift. We are home with him on hospice and he could pass anytime, so we are cherishing every moment. 

As I went to bed at 4am I set my alarm for 10:15am to get on and watch a rocket take off in a video game. Why would I choose to spend  doing something so silly during these short moments with my son? I’ll tell you:

Fortnite Battle Royale has brought so many of us together. I hopped on, and made a party with my brother-in-law who’s on the opposite coast, another guy who’s been like a younger brother to me for over a decade, and a friend from the internet whom I’ve never met in person. We all dropped in and watched a rocket go off together. It was fun, it was awesome, we all did the popcorn emote. But do you know what was special about it? I will never forget it. This game is about making memories with friends, and that’s what we humans have.  

This short time with my son is teaching me to take nothing for granted. Every day is precious. Like Andy Bernard told us at the end of the Office where he said, “I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days, before you’ve actually left them.” Guys, I’m here to tell you, these are the good old days. Friends and family have heard of our favorite video game, players in the world cup are doing Fortnite dances. This game is bringing us together like no other game before. Don't take any of this for granted. So drop into a game with friends. Get kills. Get dumped on. Goof off with shopping carts. Drop at Tilted and knock down the clocktower. 

 Play, laugh, and enjoy, these days together because these are the good old days.

As you know the rocket launch and after it launched it took target at tilted towers, but for some reason epic trolled us as of making it go through this portal hole before smashing Into tilted but does anyone know why it targeted tilted? after that it starts  coming out at moisty mire and going around the map headed towards greasy and comes out in the middle of loot lake and sky rockets towards the middle of the map creating this very vivid crack in somewhat looks like a arena / simulation shield dome that’s prevents coming in and out. But what does this mean? Maybe the visitor is trying to either let in something or break the dome shield allowing us the players stuck in the simulation go out and see what’s out there and play on different worlds and lead to different things. I don’t know just a thought on what this means. If you guys have any idea on why this happened leave a comment and start a conversation. ",FortNiteBR

With the launch of the rocket, a lot of people decided to land at the rocket site earlier. I attempted to make it there, but came up short and had to bail to over to snobby. 

I got a kill or two at snobby and then went over to the rocket to try and get into the action, since a lot of people landed there. To my surprise, no one was fighting. Everyone was chilling there dancing and counting down to launch. 

At the time, I had a blue pump, an AR, and a trap. I went down to everyone and couldn't resist. I massacred them all. First thing I did was kill the people dancing with my trap. I got about 6 kills with it. I proceeded to shoot the rest with my pump and AR. 

I killed two other people after the launch, but they didn't get to see it crash into Anarchy, but for the most part they got to see everything live. 

Overall I got 17 kills there and ended the game with a 21 kill win. It doesn't feel good though knowing I could've robbed a little kid of watching the rocket launch. I think most people had enough time to get into another game but you never know. 

Anyways, I feel bad about what I did and I'm here to ask the fortnite community to forgive me on behalf of my atrocious sins.

The crack in the sky. Remember that theory a while ago about how Battle Royale is a simulation? This supports it even more. Not only do you disappear with that drone when you die, but today we have confirmation that the map is in a dome. This doesn’t have anything to do with my theory but I was just pointing it out.

Also, I don’t think the thrusters that landed in anarchy will have any future significance ever again. Usually story items that are important (like the meteor in dusty) are unbreakable. The thrusters however are breakable and I don’t think this is a bug as it seems they were purposely set at 2000 health.


Alright, finally starting off with my theory.
There were many leaks on season 5 being ancient/history themed. I think this will happen but we have to discuss how it will happen, I believe that the visitor has left the dimension and entered a new one. I say this because he disappeared, made a portal type thing, and there was a voice in the rocket saying  “engaging multi-dimensional” or something like that. But he accidentally left that crack in this dimension. This has caused a massive ripple in the space time continuum and now things are going to leak through the portal from hundreds of years ago. The season 5 trailer will be all kinds of things flooding out of the crack in the sky and falling onto the map, and we will get a new POI, possibly the pyramids of Giza or something along those lines. We will also get a history themed battlepass.

This also ties in with the rumor about the Red Knight returning with the datamined Crimson Pickaxe. A knight is mentioned in the game files for the pickaxe. 

Also, the sky stalker skin we got was from WW1, which of course was a long time ago.

I also wanted to thank epic for hosting such a wonderful and enticing event today! I would love to see more like this.

If you have anything you’d like me to add to this theory, comment it and I’ll take a look.

were both released at the same time. So the omen is literally an omen to the visitor or something linked to the visitor. We know that omen is probably controlling omega due to his symbol all over the base. So I think the nuke was meant to make a crack in the sky, like a portal to allow more of the visitors race in.

So if the visitor is going home who is in the pod?

It could be the villains but the visitor stole their rocket so why wouldn’t they try to stop it instead of doing whatever they did

It could be the heros but why would they ever want to destroy the very place they are protecting 

It could be the visitor’s “people” but wouldn’t be so that before the rocket launched to help them? And if it was them why wouldn’t they use the pod to bring him home instead of the rocket he stole

It could also be another skin but as far as we know the heros and villians are the only cannon ones (having an actual physical representation of them selves on the map or having a loading screen) so it would be impossible to know.

They also changed all of my dance emotes to the L dance. 

After setting up the two step authenticator, today I received an email that someone is trying to log in to my account again and I received the IP address of their location. 

What are the next steps? What should I do now? How can I make sure my account is safe and how do I make sure this does not happen again. 

My credit card details were attached to my Xbox live, is my card information at risk?

If an epic employee happens to see this post I have sent an email and have a case number I can provide. I received an automated response from epic saying that refunded items can not be undone.

This brings him to the past, which is what season 5: history themed (e.g. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, etc.). There will be an extension added to the map which will fill in that indentation into the land around C8.  The time machine will be located on this extension

Do you not think that Epic Games made the C4 or to be more specific any explosives too powerful.

Well, they got to the top of where the rocket was getting launched, waited for the rocket to launch and... Well, killed everyone in there.

That's by far the biggest dick move I've ever seen in this community, he even missed the sky crack, and not only that, he fucked up the whole experience for the 400k people watching, and most importantly, for the few people he killed, who were there just to watch something unique and that cannot be repeated, after the whole hype that epic games put after that.

A leak occurred a few days after season 4 launched, the leaker claimed season 5 would be Time Travel themed, and Moisty would be gone. Most (including I) just thought it was a prank and ignored it, but then every week, Epic added stuff that the leaker said was coming, (i.e: Impulse Trap = Bouncer, Durr Burgerr meals found in the files, etc.) and then just yesterday, another leaker said the theme would be time travel, I was immediately reminded of the leak, i saw the leak and realized the leakers were right, the theme was time travel.

Both leakers gave the same explanation on what the theme meant. Their evidence? Greek, Roman, Egyptian. Both leakers said the same thing in the same order. And then, after the rocket epic sort of confirmed the leak. if you watch the Rocket, it was aiming for tilted, and then The Visitor did something to the rocket and it disappeared, and it left a crack over tilted that then later disappeared, he then came back from another crack over Moisty, the rocket seemed to be broken, it then disappeared over Loot Lake, then came back, and then he went straight for the sky, disappeared and left a huge crack that's still here right now. Alright, how does this confirm the theme, well.. These cracks seems to be rifts in time and space, seeing how he teleported from Tilted to Moisty and seeing how its a rift in TIME and space, 1st time disappearing, he might have gotten to Greek times, then came back, 2nd time he disappeared, he might have gone to Roman times. 3rd time might have been Egyptian Times, where he is now.

It was revealed in week 7 that the meteor was actually a pod, in which contained the visitor, someone from 'beyond the unknown'.

My theory is that The Visitor and his civilization have learned slip space travel (essentially teleporting). He modified the rocket to launch and shoot lasers opening up a wormhole in which his spacecraft could go through, he came out again, traveled across the map into another wormhole and out again, presumably to pick up some speed before his final launch through a wormhole through the top of the skybox. I believe he either had too much speed, or too primitive of slip space technology that he actually ripped/cracked the fabric of space time. So the fissure in the sky is a portal to another place in space/time or another dimension entirely. 

My guess is, with the most recent leaks for season 5, that it is a rip in time. Next season was rumored to have ancient Egypt/ancient Greece themes, so a tear in time would make sense. 

TLDR:
Rocket blew a hole in space time because the visitor was teleporting. ",FortNiteBR

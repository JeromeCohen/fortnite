I'll start by showing a list of ""bad"" items that were added to this game. Note the timestamps:

1. Jetpack - Mid Season 4.
2. Drum Gun - Late season 4. \*Arguable
3. Double Shotgun nerf - Start of Season 5. \*Arguable
4. Compact SMG - Early Season 5.
5. Double Barrel - Mid Season 5.
6. Bounce Pads vaulting - Start of Season 6.
7. Chiller Traps - Early Season 6. This isn't necessarily a bad item, but most people think it is useless.
8. Quad Launcher - Early Season 6.
9. Fortnitemares - Mid-Late Season 6. This update brought a lot of shit to the game; husks in normal modes, players seem alive for a short while after dying, glider redeploy (arguable).
10. Mounted Turret - Late Season 6. Possibly the worst item to be added in Fortnite. Many people can't understand how isn't it vaulted after almost a week.
11. Dynamite - Late Season 6. Again, a overall dumb item to be added considering it is a more powerfull version of the hated C4.

Basically - updates have been getting worse (way worse) in the last couple of months.

So after a couple of monthes with those terrible updates, i think we can all come to the conclusion that this game is going downhill, really fast. It's extremely frustrating to see this game become worse with every update, when it used to be so good back in the day. Instead of fixing and improving the gameplay for all players, Epic is trying to make the gameplay better for unskilled bots (and they aren't succeeding lmao). 

This game is better at its most simple state, which is why Season 2, 3, and 4 were so fun for many people. People were enjoying the core game mechanics; building and shooting, without having to deal with insane machine guns that shred structures and players.

I feel like to community is being as vocal as possible about such topics and Epic are just ignoring us. As a community, what is there left to do? I am truely wondering lol.

I hope Epic Games will make a change.",FortniteCompetitive

This will help speed up the game because people will farm less knowing they had the bonus coming up when the timer hits zero. It would also help greatly with end game rotations once the circles start to move. They could then eventually do more changes to the circles and rework it so that it doesn’t end due to a closing circle. Maybe towards the end the circles give less and less per bonus or something like that. ",FortniteCompetitive

Due to the success of my last cast - and the fact that there is literally NO good way to watch these unfold - and we are all super interested in how these scavenger cup rules play out at a pro level, I'm going to be casting again them again.

From 6pm-11pm, there will be 10 custom games played just like on Sunday. This time in the DUOS format with the 300/300/300 mat cap just announced today. There will be cash prizes again - though how much and for what I do not know at this time - I will edit that info in when I find out.

JOIN ME STARTING AT 6PM EST

[https://twitch.tv/ballatw](https://twitch.tv/ballatw)

If you are bored throughout the day waiting for these games to start, you can check out the VOD of the last cast from Saturday.

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/3372728](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/337272822)

I hope you can join me, and figure out how well this format works - this is the first time we will see duos at all in this format, and the pros will all be new to the 300/300/300 mat cap (except those sneaky ones getting a headstart checking it out on EU and playing in those customs that are live right now. We'll see if ZexRow and vinny can continue Zexrow's solo success in this mode, see if 72hrs can teach chap how to play this mode and get him off his damned quadcrasher (or if 72hrs will fall victim to the psycho quad rotates in late circles). See if th3pacifist will full send again. See how many pickaxe kills snood and thwifo can get. Should be loads of fun!

See you soon!

P.S. Please feel free to provide as much negative and positive feedback to me as you can - I'd love to get good at this - this is going to be my 3rd or 4th serious cast ever, and only 2nd for Fortnite. Things I know: I need a new mic. Keep in mind though that I am working with rebroadcasted streams and doing the observing on my own - its crazy hectic trying to catch the action WHILE casting, but this is the best we can do for now - I hope to keep bringing improvements in the future, such as adding a duo cast (need to have a synced feed somehow for this), adding graphics and better transitions, and having a dedicated observer help pick the feeds and control what gets shown to stream. Tonight will be a fully SOLO production though.",FortniteCompetitive

15,EdgyPandv,1542736874,9yuk5g,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9yuk5g/casual_players_competitive_players/,1,Casual players &gt; Competitive Players,"Epic games decision to make all these updates are for the casual players. Personally I get where there coming from, but I don’t think they should do this. Fortnite has some of the largest tournaments and large prize pools. The fact that each week it seems like the game is being updated for casual players just doesn’t make much sense. 

I myself am a west player, and have only played east for scrims. With that I feel like every person I run into is ok at the game, and isn’t a total “bot.” This could be different for east but I’m not to sure. So why make the game easier for casual players? Why not try and focus on the sweats and the grinders of the game? Doing this to your community doesn’t always end well, I have seen other game devs try and focus on “casual players” and it doesn’t make the game fun for new players. Yes epic wants the game to be fun for new players, but in turn doing that makes the competitive community not happy. So it really is up to epic, weather to tend to casual players or competitive players.

16,AGuyCalledTom,1542734688,9yu7lz,19,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9yu7lz/dear_epic/,1,"Dear Epic,","Please stop adding random items to the game. At this point, surely you know something like dynamite won't be received well by the majority of players who play this game a lot.

Adding items like dynamite and turrets feel like a carrot and string to retain very casual players. But you have to realize that each time you do this it is an insult to your core player base; aka the ones who will still be playing your game in 6 months time (if you actually start rewarding instead of isolating them)

Similarly, I know many people wanted a shotgun buff, but again, making it so that people deal higher damage through less pellets being hit isn't rewarding skill at all, and yet again promoting lesser skilled players.

I know the encouragement of casual players is your solution in the short term, but it really isn't sustainable; each update is like a slap in the face to anyone who has played the game for a decent amount of time. Eventually people will stop playing. 

I know your solution is to just keep throwing money at the competitive scene, but this only works in the short term. If there is no incentive for skill and consistency, and instead cheap weapons are promoted, the best players will realize that despite playing as well as you can, so many other factors will prevent actual skill from prevailing. 

Please, stop with the gimmicks. Random, drastic changes such as the glider redeploy and zombies before big tournaments are not ok. You cannot pass everything off as a 'test', because the subjects are the people who play your game the most. And eventually, they will get tired.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

There are two ways that i could see epic taking the item. One being an incredibly annoying timed bomb that can damage through builds. The other just being a timed bomb with a large radius. I feel like the first one is unlikely because of how the universal explosions-through-builds change was received, and when i think about the second option, it seems like the kind of thing that explosives in fortnite should have been in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about it. a grenade with a noise and drawn out timer that can blow up a full 1x1 including a stair/pyramid inside without doing dmg to the player. Someone is in a 1x1 hiding? Throw it on top and pull out your shotgun. Either the other guy has to edit out and fight or you both have a chance to time a pump shot with the bomb. That kind of interaction rewards good play without mercilessly punishing either player just because one of them found dynamite.

&amp;#x200B;

We should be careful about the backlash we express against an item that in theory might end up far less overpowered than the current explosives we have in game. This could be a step towards having grenades that offer counterplay to the person who didnt have rng on their side to find them. As it stands now all of the explosives are so unbalanced that we arent even giving a chance to a potentially balanced version of these items we all hate so much

&amp;#x200B;

And while i cant imagine epic could be so stupid to ignore the reaction of it last time, if that shit does damage through structures on release then we should go ahead and raise hell. All I'm saying is we should wait to see this. Before the turret came out everyone on this sub was talking about how easy it would be to snipe someone off the back of the turret, and how it would only be good against bots, now look how that ended up. Lets play the game with dynamite before we ask for it to get vaulted.",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve always used my ring finger for W, middle on D, pinky on A. My index finger floated mid keyboard for various binds there. I’m not sure how I picked up that habit, but it never really gave me too hard of a time. My main game for a long time was WoW and most of my number keys were bound to a mouse.

I realize now how odd that is- and screwing around, I can see why using your middle finger on W is ideal. I just always assumed other people had longer pinky’s or something to hit the number keys better? Though I never really thought about it either. That being said, I’m not used to it whatsoever, so even though I can see why it is probably better, it makes my fingers feel like they’re playing twister.

So, odd question- is it worth going against years of muscle memory to fix my finger placement?I’ve swapped a lot of keybinds in the past few weeks and it hasn’t taken more than a day or two to adjust... but I also didn’t have quite as much muscle memory involved with those either.",FortniteCompetitive

I think the important thing to keep in mind that pubs are for fun. They reacted appropriately to take zombies out of twitchcon. Redeploy was a fun test. I liked it at first but the third partying got out of control. I'm glad they removed it.

Whenever I see something OP or broken added to the game, I just see this community literally freaking out saying they don't play the game anymore cause its not fun and epic doesn't want this game to be competitive.

Turrets are OP. Zombies ruin the game. 30% explosive damage is ruining this game.

You guys sound like a broken record. Here's a tip: Get over yourself and adapt and try to have fun until something changes. I have a buddy that I duo with. Every time Epic introduced a ridiculous change, we just abuse the crap out of it until it gets hot fixed. Not because we're thirsty and need wins. But because we can adapt and just roll with the punches.

The 16 hours when explosive damage penetrated structures? You know what we did? We whined on reddit and quit playing until they removed it from the game. Just kidding. We played duos and abused the crap out of it. We literally killed dozens with explosive pen and maybe died to it once or twice because we adapted and just tried to have fun. You know what we did when turrets came out? We quit playing. We run turrets every end game and literally call ourselves psychopaths with gunning down the last team with 2 turrets.

Epic is going to make some bad calls. They will realize when they do. Just put some pants on and try to enjoy yourself until the nerf.

* Make a mat stacks have rarity like 200 stack is Common, 400 Uncommon, 600 Rare, 800 Epic and 1000 Legendary. It works perfectly.

The game is way too goofy rn and has so many dumb things. Please make the game simple again like how it was S1 - S4

It's reminiscent of the double pump days, except now it rewards aim more, which competitive players obviously appreciate. People who wish for the double pump to come back...well I have some news for you. It's basically here, you just have to have excellent aim for your second pump. 

I also love the fact that you can one-deagle wood structures. You can punish people who fortify their builds poorly, and it offers a new way to counter turtling. I can finish fights much faster with the deagle in my inventory, because you can counter defensive building in a whole new way. With SMGs/Pickaxe, if you try to wall replace, people know which build you are going for because it takes some time to destroy it. With the deagle, you can instantly destroy one of their builds that they are not expecting, and immediately wall replace it. This fact alone is enough for me to want to carry the deagle at all times in pubs. 

The deagle's FSA reset and rate of fire is slow enough that I don't think it's OP. If you try to trade shots with somebody who has a sniper at mid-distance, you will be on the losing side the majority of the time. The pull-out time is also pretty well balanced. If it were any faster, the pump/deagle combo would be OP. As it is currently though, if you pump somebody, they have plenty of time to make a defensive play before your deagle comes out - but on the other hand it's, fast enough to punish players who don't have awareness of their opponent's position. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: The deagle is super fun, is the new and balanced double pump, counters turtling, punishes poor building, and...is not OP (please don't change it Epic!) =)

Wether you agree with the changes or not, they are trying to do what they feel will help the game.  The issue is the way they are doing it. 

Lets start with the Glider Redeploy. The first introduced this mechanic in Soaring 50s, a non traditional game mode. People enjoyed it enough that they brought it to the main playlist, without testing it in a traditional mode first.

Now lets talk about whats most likely going to happen from the results of the Scavenger Cup. People seem to enjoy +50hp per kill, matt farming increase and limited matts. So Epic will see this and thinks its a great idea to bring everything from to scavenger cup into the main traditional playlist, based of the feedback they got from a, most likely, small portion of their players. 

This issue with this system of testing things, is that they are trying out multiple game changing variables at once. 

Soaring 50s, 50 on each team and glider redeploy. Great together, bad apart imo. 

Scavenger Cup, +50hp, Mat reduction, matt farming increase.

If you of you have taken in science class you know this is not a good way to test things. You wont ever know if a certain change is good of bad due to it being masked over by another change. If you want to make game changing updates they need to be test one at a time in order to get the full effect on how they effect the game.

i need to explain it better.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment the game feels off for me. And the

reason is Turbo Building. I feel like every

patch the skill gap is either getting smaller

or players are just getting closer to the skill

ceiling. Back in s1 the skill gap was very big

but as the season went it got smaller and smaller

along with these sorta ""strategy guns"" but i feel

as if turbo is the bigger problem. Everyone can just

hold down m1 and build. Back in the previous seasons

players didn't get into giant build fights and weren't

able to block mostly every shot. When Turbo first

got introduced to the game it was a lot slower it felt

more like a build assist so players could be supported

by this to help them build. Now its just a straight

up auto build. Someone above you? Just hold down m1

and look up. There is no skill of smartly placing

your things now. Its just who ever has the fastest 90s

and can get the best angles. High ground doesn't feel

that rewarding anymore. Before you didn't get into

giant build fights and you played more smart.

You didn't build up like 6 floors high above the enemy

just to get knocked down or you pushing the enemy to

not be able hit them while they are just holding down

m1 and turtling. Turbo just feels like learning

how to drive and park a car at the moment and i just

don't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to see replies but please think smartly about

what you say instead of just spitting out things and 

not thinking about it. I tried to explain my best but

i'm not that good at English or explaining.",FortniteCompetitive

So a solution to this could be. Every time a player dies, a ""[health pack](https://imgur.com/a/UMfcciE)"" drops on the body, just like the loot already does. This would reward the player in the fight, fighting the opponent, rather than the one getting lucky, and killing the guy with only one shot. 

(I feel like this would also make much more sense.)

Glider Redeploy was controversial and 60% supported it staying in the game. Therefore taking it out of the game made it a lot worse for 60% of players. They should’ve compromised to keep both the 60% and 40% happy. They can still do this.

Unfortunately, the Fortnite developers don’t seem to know what they’re doing. They need to ask their community for their opinions to make sure the game improves.

What these events have shown is that a ranked mode is what the upper portion or the community is begging for and what the casual portion of the community needs. It is clear that playing against people who you know will be of similar skill is a lot of fun and imo a lot less frustrating because even after a dumb death you know the person who killed you is just as skilled.

The biggest gripe I have with the tournaments is that the 5 hour limits is very punishing and restrictive. It requires a lot of playtime as oppose to playing very well. 

My suggestion would be a similar tourney but with a time limit of for example a week. This would let everyone have a chance to compete and wouldn't force a specific date and time on people. The only thing that would need to change is the scoring system, there should be a penalty for not reaching certain criteria, for example loosing points for not getting 3 kills or not reaching top 25.

Hear me out on why I think it is a bad addition.

1)  Splodes, miniguns and turrets are more powerful than ever because with only 1500 materials, you might spend 500 mats defending against explosives, then get pushed already at a disadvantage, because of health/mats.

2)  3rd parties have easier prey after fights because if you take a fight with 1k mats against a 750 mats opponent.  You kill him with 350 mats left.  He used 675 mats.  You now have 425 mats.  3rd party strolls in with 1500 mats, 0 kills, and destroys you.  Go ahead throw your controller.  In a regular playlist, you’ll have to spend more time farming yet you’ll retain more than enough materials to fight a 3rd party.

In my opinion, people are blinded by the HP awarded for kills and farming increase that they don’t realize that the 1500 material cap IF added to the game could greatly affect the game.

I believe the HP award should be added, and the farming increase at 20%.

I think if epic reduced damage done by weapons  that involve bloom (mainly AR), and removed falloff damage from these weapons, while at the same time reducing bloom by 20% (arbitrary), it would reduce a bit of rng, but not all of it.

Tfue: Don't need to say anything really, he was OK in the summer skirmish but people had to stretch to say he was a tier 1 player afterwards, even if people struggled to come to terms with the fact he may not be. His Fall skirmish performance was outrageously good on the other hand, showing he may be quite possibly the best (known) player in the world after winning LAN and two solo tournaments.

ZexRow: Proved he was at a pro level over the summer but only after winning week 1 and coming 3rd at LAN (and then winning every fucking custom almost yesterday) really was able to cement himself as a top player.

LeNain: Granted he barely had a Summer Skirmish but he came 1st, 3rd and 7th in the 3 online duo skirmishes before brilliantly and pretty much single-handedly qualifying for finals at LAN when his teammate died off spawn. He couldn't quite repeat that in the finals but still.

Oh and he dominated the atk races.

Thwifo: He turned 16 and then started killing people. Like killing people a lot. I think he had the second highest amount of kills per tournament of anyone in the fall Skirmish online events but I may be wrong.

72hrs: After the summer skirmish he seemed like the weak link on Liquid (admittedly not that that means much). He was brilliant in fall though, and now I think he's the best player on Liquid.

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

Some general questions to get you started off

- Do you prefer this game mode over regular ruled game modes? Why?

- How does the 50 hp kill reward affect your aggression towards other players? Should the reward be higher/lower? Why?

- Is the material limit (500/500/500) too high/low? and how does this make you build more consciously? 

- Is the increased harvest rate (+40%) good/bad? How does this affect the pace of early to mid game fights?

Keep discussion relating to the topic set. Remember that the [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitecompetitive/wiki/rules) still apply.

Wanted to share my strategy and thoughts.,"What's up guys. I'm an okay-ish mechanical player but have (in my opinion) very strong tactics, rotations, and zone reads. I have also watched probably a couple hours of skirmishes and scrims (EU, NA, Poach streams, etc.), so I am VERY familiar with playing a format. 

To be honest, my stats are actually probably pretty below average for this sub (6% WR, 1.6KD lifetime, 9% WR 2KD season 6), but I wanted to share the strategy I used to get 30 points after getting 16 and 15 the last two times.

[Proof](https://i.redd.it/4evp8oxuw0z11.jpg)

I essentially went aggro in the beginning games, aiming for 3 kills per game. After I got 3, I would play for placement, and then go aggro in top 10 in order to get 2 more kills for an extra point. Once I hit 12 points, I avoided fighting altogether unless I was in zone, 200 HP, 1000+ mats. 

Because I'm a weaker mechanical player, I knew I needed to get into a routine upon landing. The clusterfuck of a hot drop was obviously out of the question, so, given the format, I wanted somewhere that was off the bus route, full of all three material types, and isolated into big looting zones.

By looting zones, I mean buildings that are self-contained and unlikely to see another player land at. Racetrack fit all my criteria. Landing there 9 out of 11 games, I was able to loot almost all of it alone 7 times. I played normal solos to perfect my drop, landing at the back building every time, aiming for a gun on the roof before dropping down to grab a possible 3 chest spawns and 4 floor loot spots — not to mention the floor loot outside the back building.

I followed the same path around the back to the rocks and trees — farming everything I saw, especially the tire guards (14-16 metal for 2 swings) — on the way to the grandstand before then heading to the main building. I also was usually able to hit the diner. It was in these latter two areas that I encountered other players, but because I had a long path of farming and an excess of floor loot spawns (higher likelihood of shotguns), I could win almost any fight. 

My biggest problem as a player is fat-fingering quick builds/edits and underestimating players (taking too much pubs in a pubs' fight only to get 3rd partied and die), but to the latter weakness, this tournament was curative. Because I **knew** everyone was probably good, I played smart and carefully. And it paid off.

After I looted/fought at race track, I was either in zone or had rifts to use. If I was in zone, I immediately went down to either Paradise or up to Containers, scouting and taking a fight if I had the drop on someone.

In the case of my last game (I queued with 26 points), I quickly turtled and waited for zone. I only got one kill in my last game but did manage 3rd place and felt really good keeping up with the scrim pace as well as quickly building turtles. I know this pin doesn't mean much, but being able to strategically snag the pin (rather than slaying out with mechanical skill) and improve against some of the best players is a fantastic feeling.

If you guys are curious, I play on a standard PS4 controller with Kontrol Freeks and instant edit on L3. My console is a PS4 Pro and I play on a 4K LG monitor with a 60Hz refresh rate and 4ms input lag.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, someone made a video claiming Ninja got them banned for ""Having a higher ping than me."" It seemed VERY obvious to me that Ninja was just telling a joke with the report, but wanted Epic to investigate anyway just in case there was anything fishy going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; We take the reporting and actioning of accounts very seriously. We treat every report the same and follow the same process to determine what action is necessary.

\&gt; There are two accounts involved in this: Account A which was the account originally reported by Ninja and Account B which is tied to a YouTube video we discovered

\&gt; On Oct 2nd, Account B was disabled for reasons unrelated to player reporting.

\&gt; On Oct 3rd, Account A was reported by Ninja. It was investigated and not actioned due to lack of evidence.

\&gt; On Oct 4th, Account A changed their display name away from the name reported on October 3.

\&gt; On Nov 13th, Account B was re-enabled based on a review of the underlying system.

\&gt; On Nov 17th, account B changed their display name to match the display name of account A at the time of Ninja's report.

\&gt; We became aware of a YouTube video claiming that we banned (and then unbanned) account B based on Ninja's report, which is false. We hope this clears up the sequence of actions.

&amp;#x200B;

If you watch the video, OP of said post provides ZERO evidence of his claim. None. Absolutely zero evidence of what occured. And yet... it is one of the most upvoted posts in the history of /r/FortNiteBR. To quote Ninja, I'm sorry, what?  


I guess, for lack of a better way to put this, is the /r/fortnitebr community really that retarded?

**Low Ground**
This area is the most mat and health conservative, if you find yourself with little shield, and a low amount of mats.
 *The advantages of low ground are:*
• Saves materials by only having to build above and around, not beneath

*The disadvantage to staying low ground is:*
• Worst positioning to move up or down a mountain/landmass
• with glider redeploy gone, more players will move to low ground will fall damage as a factor

**Mid Ground**
 This area is best for those who have a decent amount of materials, are looking to take close encounter fights, and have a lot of health.
*The advantages of mid ground are:*
• Better rotations as you have the height to move up or down accordingly 
• Allows for increasingly aggressive gameplay as a majority of players are in the mid ground level
• flexibility for mobility, easier access to moving around landmasses

*The disadvantages of mid ground:*
• Wastes the most materials turtling as you need to build above and below you
• Higher chance of death due to the increased encounters with other players.

**High Ground**
This area is specifically for those with the most materials, and best starting positioning. Also noting your loadout, such as rifts or grapplers are essentials for taking height. 
*The advantages of high ground are:*
• increased kill potential as you are able to shoot down on everyone more easily
• Best rotations as mountains/land masses are not an issue
• Mat conservation, you only need to build beneath you instead of all around

*The disadvantages of high ground:*
• Fighting for height is incredibly risky, there is no guarantee you will even succeed, can lead to loss of mats and health with no benefit
• In addition, you can be threatened by psychos with grapplers and rifts. Be prepared to take engagements

***Great I’m here. Now what?***

No matter what positioning you have, take advantage of the situation you are put in. While arguably the best positioning is High to low, all have various advantages.

**Low**
•When in low ground, take advantage of your mat conservation. Low ground allows you to save mats more efficiently, when the time comes for end game, you can outlive your opponents by not taking as many engagements.

**Mid**
•This positioning is the best for aggressive gameplay. Take 3rd party shots, take advantage of the players rotating around you, and do some damage. With glider redeploy gone, it would be expected to see more players in the low to mid range, as falls damage now applies. With the most people around, you can get various shots off on rotating players. This damage can lead up to kills, which puts you in an advantageous position for loot. 

**High**
•This is the overall best positioning possible as you can shoot down on targets most efficiently. Make sure to take time in between rotates to get shots off on players below. Height is also the best for end game heal offs, as you only have to worry about people below (it’s harder to shoot up then down) and you can send one player beneath to disrupt a potential other player mid ground healing. It’s much easier to drop down and psycho somebody to stop their heal, then to push upwards and do the same.

There is rule that you can't contest RazZzer0o on Motel and Ghost Issa on Shifty. This basically provides them alot of mats and good loot every game. 

RazZzer0o threathens to ban people who take mid game fights since he (and many others) want to practice end game. Last time during scrims he posted [this] to his discord.(https://m.imgur.com/a/UIJmiR7). Again he threthens to ban everyone who takes mid game fights and tells that everyone should play for win.

He doesn't seem to realize that for some if not most people taking mid game fights can be the highest change to win. Pretty much everyone else will be contested, they must fight when they're rotating from their drop spots and have no time to loot and farm and usually less health than RazZzer0o and Issa since they will not be contested and nobody wants to fight them after landing due to being scared of getting banned.

Imagine someone landing wailing woods with 2 other teams. Both players of the duo survive alive out of there, but only with around 100 health and little mats and ammo. They need to run far away for circle and their loot / mats is not enough to win the game. Their best change is to go and try to kill team with better position. Example killing RazZzer0o and his teammate is good way to win matches, since they got alot of loot and mats due to not being contested at all. There is not even places really near Motel to drop.

I've also seen RazZzer0o take mid game fights himself multiple times. 

I understand that he wants alot of people survive end game and i realize that well. Need to keep in mind that in latest tournament formats kills have been giving alot of points. It's also his Discord so he has right to do what he wants.

The state of RNG in fortnite:
(example)
Player A: lands at a house and finds
- AR, pump, RPG and 2 big shields 

Player B: finds 
- Burst, smg, bandages and some extra ammo 

This is possible and it's NOT fair.

How to fix? (help in comments)

My ideas.
A house should at least have 1 kind of shield NOT more.
1 kind of shotgun.
1 kind of AR.

Enemy's building audio is also bugged.

2) TRAPS AND TURBO BUILDING : There are some issues with the trap placement. I try to put a trap but sometimes there is a delay for trap placement. I also noticed a slight random delay in turbo building.

3) TURRET: I know the turret drop rate is adjusted but I still see a decent amount of them end game. I think the damage needs to be adjusted. I don't wanna say completely remove it because it's fun if your whole squad is firing it for the last kill :) 

4)  COLOR OF LOCATION MARKER: Please, for the love of llamas, change the ugly yellow back to red.

When Turbo first came out it was a lot slower. People who wanted to click could still click and keep up or be faster. When it was like that i was completely fine. You had to place your stuff smartly and it didn't force giant build battles. And once it got buffed the meta got crazier and crazier to the point where you could barely hit people without jumping right close to them. (in build battles) They can just keep holding down m1 and block mostly every shot. And you keep building and building until both of you used at least like 400 mats. Now this is from my point of view. I like stomping games. And the fact that turbo is just encouraging build battles instead of placing your stuff carefully and working around what you have placed. In my opinion Turbo should be a build assist instead of something that just makes you able to block most shots and do some incredible ramp rushes. If turbo was a build assist the skill gap would be bigger and people would come up with methods of how to click faster like jitter clicking or butterfly clicking. I don't really know what else to say. I have other things in my head but i don't know how to explain them since i'm terrible at explaining.,FortniteCompetitive

But then again, every once in a while, you have that guy who does.

I saw 2 guys about to start a fight, but as soon as they got next to each other, a rift-to-go had been deployed, so I focused one guy while they were both in mid air and managed to hit a guy ~4 times with an AK and kill him. Then there was just that other guy left, and he landed on a hill near by, so I had to take high ground, got to his level and then he breaks my build (not high, I just took a 2 story high ground, he was on the hill at the time), and obviously that bot carries DB (don't get triggered by me calling him a bot, it's just facts - who has literally 0 kills in top 8 in a pub game is clearly a bot) and melts me when I drop down. Prior to that he tried to prevent me from going up his hill with his deag, so I had no idea what kind of shotgun he was wielding.

Now, had I known he had one, I would have built right away, as soon as I dropped, but I didn't - I tagged him first, and before I knew what was going on I was dead (I had 195HP - he did hit both of his shots from up close).

This gives way too much advantage to defenders who are out of position.  It makes pro games a mess in the final circles, and it favors players with low ping.

Epic needs to nerf turbo building so that a small percentage of bullets pass through walls.  Even if only 10% could pass through it would speed up the pace of play and give attackers an advantage.

When Epic decides to get around to nerfing this, it'll alleviate all of the issues in scrims and pro matches.

Epic uses AWS servers for hosting Fortnite. AWS only has East and West coast regions. From the below Epic comment from the 80ms being playable thread, I'm assuming they've been in contact with the other major players in cloud hosting and have found none of them currently have the architecture to support their needs. It literally just does not exist. 

https://i.redd.it/933pg60o1ry11.png

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;ok then just build servers lol 

Building servers is probably not viable and would take, at the very *very* least, a year. Since they aren't using any of their own servers currently, they don't have any of the resources, talent, or process to orchestrate something like this. Drafting the initial proposals would take longer than you guys want to wait. 

It sucks, but Epic just can't fix this overnight. It's not because they don't care. It's not because they're stingy. It's because it is impossible at the moment. 

There are plenty of other things we can pressure Epic on that they actually have control over. This is not one of them. Pushing the issue will only foster more tension between Epic and the competitive community. ",FortniteCompetitive

Is it correct that at any angle other than high ground, from the front, the turret user is invincible?

Some counterplays I can think of when facing a turret at even or slightly lower ground:

- snipe or FSA the turret user 
- - turret hitboxes prevent player from being hit

- take out the building the turret is placed on
-- turret targets you and spams to the point where you can no longer do damage to the foundation structure.

- build up for high ground to get a better angle where you might be able to catch the head hitbox of the turret user
-- turret spams your build down

- push towards turret to try to get cc
-- turret spams you with almost constant spam (very quick cooldown) making this maybe the best but still very ineffective option

Right now it seems like if you're targeted by a turret at mid/long range, and you don't have high ground, there's nothing else to do but to run.

[PLEASE READ],"Audio in Fortnite has always been a long-discussed topic ever since the game came out. Over the last year, they have added a few updates that have changed the way it works, with things such as changing the building sounds per material, adding different sounds for if the player is above and below you, and changing footsteps so that enemies are louder than your teammates. These changes made audio in Fortnite unarguably better, but still not great.

Recently it seems like audio has been broken, there have been numerous times when a player builds up to you and hits you with a blast of a shotgun, and the only indication that they are there is the giant chunk of health that has suddenly gone missing. 

This problem seems to happen when there is something going on. There can just simply be fighting going on around you (Where you can hear other players shooting at each other in close proximity, really noticeable in scrims), while your shooting at one player's teammate (Of which the other will come up behind you with no indication), or other semi-loud guns being shot (Turret, rockets, ect)

From [my personal examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdAyKVLvvwQ&amp;feature=youtu.be), you can see that during the first clip I am spraying at one of my enemies in a duo game, seemingly safe as the other player would be assumingly under me as there are no sound effects of him building up towards me accompanied by footsteps. Obviously, when he pumps me in the back I am quite surprised. At the end of the video, I replay the clips with the audio boosted. With this boost, you may just be able to hear a single footstep. The second clip takes place shortly after the first clip, of which a team comes up behind us while we are looting/healing. I place a turret to spam them (Thanks for this update btw that gun is really balanced), while I think that they are both behind their own walls (One on the rock, and one at the shore) I quickly find out that the one at the shore is no longer there, and hitting me with a shotgun in the back. I understand that the turret is a loud weapon, and rightfully it should be, but I should be able to hear if a player is right beside me swapping to a shotgun regardless of what weapon I am using.

The reason that this is irrelevant now is that if double pump (and double pump exclusively no other shotgun combo) came back in the end of season 4 state it wouldn't be meta at all, it would get shredded by almost every combo in the game. 

In my opinion if pump/deagle is in the game than double pump should too, they are both weaker than pump/smg and pump/ar if we're talking about consistency, but they are both far more satisfying to use. In fact it would probably give weaker players who use pump/smg a better shot against stronger players who use off meta combos. 

Also they should simply make the timer for the other shotguns the same amount of time it takes to cock back after a shot, then you can tfue classic without getting cockblocked by the timer with tacs and heavies. Why this wasn't the case in the first place makes no sense. 

I think one valid concern epic had was that it was OP against newer players, but the player base has evolved radically and building is far more prevalent, thus reducing the power of the double pump. 

With the addition of just un-fun mechanics like the new turret being added all the time and the entire player base being stuck using pump/smg for 2 seasons I think it's time to add back this fun mechanic that wouldn't radically alter the meta in pubs or comp. ",FortniteCompetitive

282,randomnicer,1542383607,9xncer,47,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9xncer/what_sport_psychology_tell_us_about_performance/,1,What sport psychology tell us about performance. (long post),"As a high level sport coach (and season 1 fortnite fanatic) I had some opportunities to speak with a couple of really good performance coaches and psychology professors. I stole some info from lectures at a high-performance coaching study and I am now typing this up so I can place all my notes and information in context for myself and thought why not make it a post. This post will be focused on competitive games/fortnight, Cause competition is the essence of a sport/game. No matter the level of play, u first have to get out there. In a place were its only winning our losing with players within your own level of skill. 

In a competitive environment the result you get is a mixture of inputs (opponents) and a player is only partially in control to get the result that he wants. As a mental aspect this is problematic, because players cant help to feel responsible for the result that their getting. They also get judged on that result by their peers, the competition and themselves. And when the results get more important, the lack of control can express itself as pressure to perform. 

Pressure to perform can be scary but is not negative in itself. It indicates that there is something on the line (Money, feelings, dreams or ambitions), and that there is a chance to realize that possibility. Like Michael Jordan once said; pressure is nothing more than the shadow of great possibility. 

Individual skills to cope with performance pressure is an essential part of succeeding in a competitive environment. Mental skills are a basic tool to perform, a lot of people know this. But in reality not many players will (no matter the level of play) mostly focus improving on their skills and game knowledge. We mostly know how to use mental skills (I need to stay calm, keep my focus and never give up), but there is a difference between knowing something and doing something. If you have the ability to do something you also have to do it at the right moment. Don’t expect to always use mental tools in the right way or the right moment. Cause from time to time humans mess up all kinds of basic skills. And even if you are mentally strong that does not mean you can’t improve. 

when you can use developed skills with the right timing, there will be no loss in performance. The skill that you have will come out in its full potential and is called performance potential. In a competative game, this will be the best of your abilities. Some people believe that they can perform better under pressure, which is simply not true. You can’t do better than you have ever done before. In a training exercise (our pub game/ playground) being convinced you can will result in more pressure and leads to performance loss. Knowing your limitations is important in a competitive situation as is protects you from making mistakes. 

Performance = performance potential – performance loss

In a competition it’s nearly impossible to get to your full performance potential. There will always be a bit of performance loss. That a sprinter will defeat his personal record in a final game seems plausible, but after studying the training results in the weeks or days before this final makes it clear that the sprinter was beating his PR already. Additionally, a student could think he is better under pressure as he passed an exam with only a nights of studying. If this student would take the same time  and focus, to learn, spread out of the week before his result would be better and heartier because more information would stay after the test. 

In a sprinting game or with a simple task there will be less performance loss. In a game where there are a lot of factors, that limit your control, the loss in performance will be a lot bigger. So as a player, you are doing incredibly well if you come close to your performance potential while playing a game of Fortnite.

What makes you choke at the most important time, game or moment is unfortunately impossible. When you are watching a streamer in a stressful game and notice that he misses a stack materials among the loot shortly after he dies because he lacks materials it seems strange. But this happens and is a really hard to figure out exactly why this happens. It has multiple reasons, and that’s great. Otherwise one would feel really dumb for chocking and not preventing it. It is makes sport/ games fun and unpredictable to watch and or play, anything can happen and wins are sometimes a result of an enemy’s chocking.

Now I will discus 5 complementary perspectives on performance that can help you fulfill your performance potential. The most important viewing point and the essence of these perspectives are: control the controllables. Meaning that you only have control of your own input, focus on that.

\- Get better at the game and invest in your performance potential. If u want to perform better the first step is to get better. This is a complementary system that requires and eventually results in extra time and concentration. If your mechanics get better you could play a faster game or get more options to reach a goal or advantage. If your game sense gets better your decision-making gets better and enemy players won’t be able to punish you as much and you will have more options to pressure them. Your mental state gets better because you have more control. These 3 points are complementary so it works in all directions. If 1 gets better, through interaction the other 2 will benefit from this. If one gets worst, it drags the other 2 down as well. (for example, if one stopped playing for a while and returned your mechanics will be worse which could influence your mental state resulting in making stupid decisions ,game sense wise, which lead will lead to more stressful situations and thus further influence your mechanics, until it spirals out of control and you rage quit.

\- Performance pressure. If you play in a completion that has personal significance for you, most of the time there will be a physical reaction. This is mostly caused by evolution and it helped humans survive. A higher heartrate, sweating etc. this physical reaction or arousal make us physically ready for the action that is to come which makes it part of the game. Pin most cases players will interpret this excitement in a negative sense and create negative effects. The most important thing here is that its normal. So interpret it as normal. Your body being ready for action is there to help you reach your objective. The moment is important for you and there is something on the line. It’s great that you can have a physical reaction because it will help you to thrive in stressful situation. If you feel the excitement in a game, know that you are ready. You don’t have control over winning only over your actions. Try to focus on that instead of focusing on the excitement. 

\- If you can’t keep your arousal in check there are some things that can help u get there.

o Focus on breathing in a normal pace, and relax.

o Have routines before playing and sticking to them.

o Visualize the actions and tasks in situations in the game you are about to play

These skills are good to know and learn. Even positive excitement can hinder your form and prevent reaching your performance potential. Your heartrate should be higher in the loading screen than during the game. If you focus on a task your body will adapt. And your arousal will fit to your task, so if u focus on your arousal your heartbeat will go up and you will feel more aroused. Control the arousal and try not to let your arousal control u. this is a game within a game and like a game u don’t always do what u want. In the next point I try to make this more clear. 

\- Negative thinking. It’s impossible to not think negatively from time to time. And putting the thought away is not always an option. Like the elephant analogy, if you try not to think about an elephant you will probably  think about an elephant. If u really don’t want to think negatively you will think badly about you thinking negatively which makes it impossible to not think negatively. So let your thoughts be, like your excitement. Try to focus on the task at hand and your body and mind will follow . Negative or positive thoughts and excitement will come up from time to time, however. thoughts are not constant or permanent. So if a negative thought comes up, register that you have a thought without judgment and try to move on and refocus. If you are really struggling with this in your life or during a game. Ask for help, because talking to somebody about this helps and if u do it with a professional it can make a lot of differences in your game and in life. 

\- Refocusing on your task. In a game where so much can happen, in life or during a crisis situation. Its impossible to focus for the whole duration, you will lose focus from time to time. Its not the ability to focus that makes a difference, it’s the ability to refocus yourself time and time again. No matter the situation, focus on your task. In all this u have not all the control over the situation, humans no gods. So don’t try to feel like you should control everything. It’s really hard sometimes but saying or thinking you have no control is also incorrect. You have control over what you do and a bit in how you do it. So try to use every ounce you have got to do as much as you can. And the more you do that the more you will get out of the potential of that situation.

That’s why controlling the controllables is key. You can’t control what you can’t control. Thinking about the past, the weather, the fps, bugs or the input-lag will not improve your performance. If you are doing this, are tilting or confronting yourself with failure and are not on the level that you want to be, think about the bigger picture and your core values. These are there to shape the path that you want to be on. Do you want to perform at your max performance potential? go for it with all u got. You won’t feel regret if u do things that are important to you. So what are u risking? Feelings, thoughts and situations change over time, nothing is forever and going all out is the most fun u can have in your live (except when doing drugs/dangerous things, be careful in those cases). Fear regret, and don’t fear putting yourself out there, improving and vulnerability are close together and make you feel alive.

At last: winning or losing is not the thing that matters in games, don’t play if you only want to win because there are a lot more losers than winners (especially in fortnite). Set goals for yourself based on your performance. For example, if you want to win a game, try to survive as long as possible. If you get close you have reached your goal and the next time you will feel good if you performed better. And if you do it to the fullest of your potential but the competition was better, you still gave it your all. So after a while you can think or feel positive about it.

Got into a couple of great lobbies and honestly ill say it. They are so much better than scrims. Here's why. In scrims you spend about 15 minutes just preparing for end game. Maybe have 1 or 2 engagements and that's it. There's really low level players mixed in scrims so if you get a kill on a bad player that happens to have really good loot you essentially get an unfair advantage over another guy who had to fight another scrimmer.



In the pop up cup at around 15 points every player is of almost the same skill level. Early game is a lot better than scrims because people play very smart and try to do what's best to win and don't just yolo engage like in a pub. With the mats increase and lowered cap i felt like i was farming very little compared to the amount of time i do it in scrims and it made the game less dragging and more fun. I felt a lot more rewarded for kills due to the point system aswell as the 50 health reward.



If Epic isn't working on a legitimate comp mode i think they should introduce a beta version where they roll through different formats every week with an elo system that doesn't reset. This way they could try out different comp formats (similair to skirmish) while also giving us a 24/7 SBMM mode. Regular playlists would still be playable and comp would be hidden under a little tab.

Over the past few weeks i've felt the improvements slow, the things i'm having to focus on have become more and more obvious, but i'm at a loss as to how to actually practice these things. Does it just come with time, replaying the specific scenario randomly, enough times, until your brain triggers to do the better play? 

An example would be when rushing someone and you get your ramp above theirs (effectively blocking them) and editing your ramp to drop onto theirs and shotgun them. I didn't use to do that, i'd end up retaining high ground and slowing down the speed of the kill - but this is something i practiced way back in the day(before PG), i used to practice building up and editing the ramp to fall through it. It was easy to practice and quickly mastered because that ""scenario"" happens often. 

Nowadays the things i know i want to improve on, seem to be harder to actually implement, like editing/close/tight play and stuff like coning an opponent - i feel like the only way to practice that is by being in game with opponents, having the real pressure but still being able to react - but it's so hard to then implement when it's a new mechanic you're not quite used to. 

I already watch a tonne of streams (competitive players), play a bunch, watch replays of deaths, but am specifically looking for some kind of routine/warmup that could potentially help with the close-knit editing/speed and if any other suggestions for stuff that can be done in playground (billy no-mates over here, at least on FN haha) would welcome anything for direction toward improvement besides ""just play"".",FortniteCompetitive

Id like to suggest Changes to Building as the Core gameplay changed from it.
In the past you had very quick weapon draw and swapping between building and weapon was relatively quick aswell.
Even the past tense building towards weapon swap was something you could react to in a 1v1 scenario. This makes me question why the change was made in the first place...
In addition to that you did not have Turbo building.
And to top of the crown we even got an auto Material change once ur materials run to 0.
The map also was widely spread with unbuildable zones, so shooting someone who was just passing a tree or farming it was a viable strategy. increasing oppertunitys and made players do more thoughtful progression towards the later stages of the game.
Its also required to mention that the oppertunity you had with shotguns back then was scaling better into getting the enemy compared to nowadays. Same goes with rifles having damage dropped of at a distance, this used to not exist and players did use this to overall secure more quickly kills.

*Heres an old players few liner story that describes building was never too weak at any point in the game. This is from December last year ( sorry for not having a clip ) 
Squad game 5 people remaining. Me alone, 3 people in a team and a last solo aswell.
Me having a good amount of wood, all 3 were trying to shoot me, but not only where they not able to do so . but thanks to me standing at a square where i was able to build left and right, i was able to advance slowly with walking towards them, used were ramp floor wall and rooftop at the same time. in the end i had a medium sized 3 story base with left and right a bit extra. during this the enemy team got lasered by the solo guy and i was able to win.*

Thats pretty straight forward showing building is not only strong but overpowering, and that was in the past.
Dont get me wrong, building should be strong. but if your eating pizza with one hand and build with  the other its too much. Movement and hotkeys should be part of the equation.

All those changes buffed defensive play hugely.
This was before everyone knew how to build, people didnt even use Pyramids ( f4 ) back then.

Given how the game plays out right now playing defensive gives too much time without challenging the defender much. 
This is one reason holding back competetive in my opinion, that we currently have too simple defensive play with huge value attached to it.
Agression on the other hand is designed way more risky, you get bloom on most lethal shots.
Whereas people got somewhat better avoiding to get hit by all pellets of the shotgun.
Removal of bloom is also not very likely to be a good option, since it wont fix rng of the game. 
people have adventages based on circle position or from peeking right by default.
Maybe at most you can reduce it across the board a little. 

Right now your only option to outbuild your enemy is to either have more mats or get good angles by the circle. If players are somewhat ""skillcapped"" on high level building, aka everyone is a pro this is less likely to happen. That makes people rely on your enemy not knowing how to cover themself while building up, to get agressive oppertunitys.
An enemy is also way less likely forced to ""come out of his box"" which costs overall allot less materials given how exposed the attacker is by making gunshot sounds. 
Even if the attacker builds a box around him while attacking you, he is the one that gets 3rd partied most of the time. The reason why this is so effective is because it is difficult to hear the sound instantly when ur own gun is shooting. And even if sound changes were to be made the attacker still would be in more trouble then the defender. 
This goes as far as the attacker being unable to get value from his continous attacking and is forced to box up aswell. 

And this is how we get games where 60-70 people are in the last circles.
People lacking options to test the defender.

Building also has one major scaling fault that enables you to build against multiple people at once, its not always given but people who use it turn invicible with materials. And that is the factor if you position yourself correctly your building potential becomes doubled since your range of building allows to you to do so. I believe that this function or baseline never has been talked or questioned in itself. This is part of the equation that will always be important and always be used by everyone and having the effect of making people able to advance or defend against large scale assaults.
This point on its own is something that can be talked about resulting into various ideas. It is  very core and important to keep in mind when talking about defenses being to strong.

Lastly i want to mention repair function is not so much used or useful in the grand sheme of things.
This should be adressed aswell.

**LTM details :**
- Name : ??? 
- Mode : solo

Patch suggestion for the LTM:

*Building changes:*
 
- Building can now reach 1 square further by default, meaning you can always reach 1 tile longer then  default and if positioned correctly you have access to 3 tiles. This also will affect your abillity to place traps 1 square further then usual. ( This will allow players to use the rotate function aswell to increase their building skill potential )
- Building gets inbuilt a 250 ms ( milliseconds ) cooldown for the player who just built a certain type of structure. Meaning if you build a wood wall , you cannot place another wood wall building for 250 ms, this will result into you using a rock wall instead or metal depending what kind of ressources you have. 
- Building gets a 15 charge baseline meaning you can still build your usual box of 4 walls or double ramp or quickly do a 90s ascension on one material. Those charges refresh every 12 seconds once the first building has been laid down. The charges also will not be counting seperatly. Meaning if you want to keep spending materials it has to be other types of materials or other types of buildings. This first phase essentially will be your ""Turbo Build"" , while the other is the ""Standarized Construction Availabillity Process"".
To keep the logic short, once your out of charges you can no longer spam the wall of one material and instead spend another type. If you have used all 3 types of material and the 250ms are not over, you cannot place another wall requiring you to either use a ramp or other type to fill the gap. ( this still will allow you to build up solo against a full squad, as you can place further and thus place floors on top of the walls or edited rooftops, harder but doable )

- Reduce the max HP of a wood wall by 25 down from 150 to &gt;  125
- Reduce the max HP of a rock wall by 100 down from 300 to &gt;  200
- Reduce the max HP of a metal wall by 150 down from 500 to &gt;  350

- Reduce the max HP of a wood ramp, floor, roof by 30 down from 140 to &gt;  110
- Reduce the max HP of a rock ramp, floor, roof  by 100 down from 280 to &gt; 180 
- Reduce the max HP of a Metal ramp, floor, roof  by 140 down from 460 to &gt; 320

- Repair now heals 50 % quicker and costs 25 % less.

Those changes wont affect how quickly a building gains health when built for the first time.


- Harvested ressources get increased by 75 %. This affects everything except man made walls.

- Chests now spawn 50 metal by default. instead of 20 of a random material.

- Floor loot can longer be materials, instead you start with 10 wood 10 stone and 10 metal.

- Loot drops now give 200 metal by default, instead of 20 of a random material.
  Increased loot drops spawn rate by 35 %.

- Decrease drop rate of Legendary weapons on floors and chests by 75 %.

- Port a Fort gets its rarity and drop chance changed. It will go from Blue to Green Rarity and become more likely to be dropped. Additionally the Port a Fort will become Neutral and Harvestable, for a small amount of Metal similar to a wall. This means everyone can edit it.

- Port a Fortress will get a similar change, but on top of that you will have 100 wood and 100 rock spawned in the middle of the fortress.
 
- trap damage gets reduced by 25 from 150 to &gt;  125

**Weapon changes:**

- Weapons now draw across the board 20 % quicker.
- SMGs are unaffected by this change.
- Pistols draw 35 % quicker instead.

additional changes :
- chiller gets vaulted, and replaced by smoke grenade.
- scoped rifle gets vaulted, and replaced by dual pistols.
- grapler gets vaulted, and replaced by bouncepad ( the old one where you had 4 directions on it ).

*Two last special questions that have been bugging me for a while:*
1. Why does the pickaxe only posses a left click and what kind of options could be used to give it a useful right click option ?

2. What is a realistic ""max loadout"" for trap inventory so it  wont be too much ? 
( we got 4 at the moment ) 

Please discuiss if this type of LTM would be great to test with those numbers.
Even if you dont like the LTM, theres other things questioned in the core gameplay of the game that could be talked about.

**TL DR: Defensive play is way to simple to test a player, even with old core design of one year ago. Bigger changes would be recommended for testing.**",FortniteCompetitive

I don't know why epic added SEA as a sub region as some of us get better ping on EU servers.
In the Scavenger cup all I got were the Japanese servers.I was forced to play on 130+ ping after waiting for 10 minutes because of que times.
We have a lot of competitive players but we don't scrim because we would be getting 100+ ping most of the games .
They are pushing for Korean and Japanese scene which is great from a business standpoint as well as competitive but it feels like they are leaving us in the dirt.
Epic should separate SEA from the main Asia servers I have no idea why it isn't the main  one.

Thoughts:

\- It was interesting to see about 7 people drop walling in game 3 ( Per Chaps replay VOD), both chap and Tom got engaged early game.

\- Not much building after 5 people are left alive, its very 50-50 after top 5 or so. People don't have many mats

\- Customs just test how well the lag is when a lobby is full of pros. It looked fine except for game 3 where you could see a bit of lag (might be twitch idk)

&amp;#x200B;

Don't take these results too serious due to no actual point tracking or system in these customs , but lets discuss the new mode. I think I see EPIC reducing the mat cap officially and also keeping the health incentive for killing.

I watched Chaps view, as well as Tom's. What did you guys see from other point of views? 

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest Take away: 

Felt like not many people were playing for wins and the player count was extremely low compared to skirmishes.

What are these weapons? RPGs, Heavy Shotguns, Double Barrel Shotguns, Grenade Launchers, and heavy snipers. These weapons are incredibly unbalanced because they are very powerful, so powerful that they are often the difference in close fights. These weapons need to be removed from the RNG loot pool, and should only be available from supply drops.


5 Supply Drops and 1 Llama need to spawn each time the storm closes. These supply drops will only spawn during the second, third, and fourth closing of the circle and these supply drops will display to the map which of the 5 weapons is inside. Llamas will return to their original glory, with 1500 mats and rockets, along with heals.

It is pretty apparent how this helps the RNG-fest, but it's not so obvious as to how it solves the 60 player turtle meta. I will explain:

There is now a reason to fight during midgame. You have a much higher chance of winning the game with a heavy sniper or an RPG than without. Players will fight to get these weapons from the drop. Currently, there is no reason to engage an enemy until the 5th or 6th circle. However, teams will fight over the chance to get an RPG, as an RPG increases your chances to actually win.",FortniteCompetitive

Since then i can say im a really decent player i keep making progress as i play more and more, I have won a Gold pin with 27 points in the Solo v2 tournament lately and i win 3-4 games per gaming session usually with my kills in those games almost always ranging around 3-8.

The only thing that ever bothered me was the piercing damage on explosives which even then i suggested some options on how they could keep it in game and be fair and of course i got downvoted to hell by angry kids, even though it was a constructive criticism as epic demanded we do. 

Players that played csgo or lol and were like high gold (i dont really know about the cs equivalent) or above must understand what it takes to be competitive and adapt to changes, learn the meta fast so you can ""abuse"" it and always blame yourself and not the game for your mistakes.

In the LoL subreddit and in many other relative subreddits like summoner school, it was possible to keep a healthy conversation about the meta and how to improve generally as a player, I always tried to help with posts or comments and make the community learn the game and understand better in general, as far as my knowledge could help. If someone started taking nonsense, you could easily look him up, see his rank and understand exactly why he was saying what he was saying in any case.

**In this subreddit though** every fucking one thinks that they must be some kind of high level player or borderline pro and dont even consider listening to others or make a healthy and civilized dialogue about anything.

Personally when they announced they would put redeploy in the game i thought it would be bad, but after playing it helped understand that it helped in so many things that it was a great addition and it only needed some balancing/nerf to be viable for everyone. 

Many people hate it because pubstomping and/or not so high skill popular streamers disliked it, or just because you hated to be 3rd partied but **NO FUCKING ONE** of you who hated it, tried changing your playstyle or learn how to play smarter in order to survive.

This subreddit has become the equivalent of some bronze/silver player coming here to cry/hate on something that cant even understand well enough to use it properly and wants it out of the game because he just cant adapt for fuck sake. A ranking system is really needed in order to be able to evaluate how much someone actually knows the game or not.

Its not an issue in solos really, but in duos/ squads, if one players spams the quad launcher while the other sprays an AR/smg, you are royally screwed. I know epic gave it a limited splash radius and the rockets drop off at range, but neither one of those really affect it where its used most: close range. The fact you can jump and shoot it right in front of you to kill someone like its a damn shotgun is ludicrous. Not to mention how in duos/squads a player with max rockets can burn through all of your mats from any range. I appreciate support weapons that require strategic/skilled use, but im opinion, this isnt one of them.

I think it should either be vaulted or at the very least only destroy one tile like explosives used to do. Its a disaster to go against late game in scrims and is still extremely frustrating in pubs.

The impact of redeploy on competitive must be considered in combination with how it effects the casual player because of two things:

1) The pro game and pub game must have the same underlying mechanics. The pro scene will be sustained by viewership, and people watch the pros because they're the best in world at playing a game people enjoy themselves. Pros regularly do techniques that are inconceivable to the average pub player - but the key is that they're possible, they're just a pro pushing the same mechanics we all play on to the limit.

2) The mechanics need to work in both games (comp &amp; pubs). If a new mechanic (i.e. re-deploy) works in the competitive game but not in pubs, it doesn't work. The big advantage to comp was rotations were much easier, so you didn't have to burn 1000 mats if you get a bad zone. In pubs, you don't have to do this, and mats are easy to come by. The big disadvantage to pubs was that you were always getting third-partied - this doesn't happen in comp, because everyone plays safe until the circles are tiny and third-parties are irrelevant.

In summary, we can't separate the two. The games must be the same or the viewership will suffer and the pro scene will suffer. Also, the way the two modes (comp / pubs) are played is fundamentally different, and you need to consider how a change effects both. The pros that only consider how the change effects their corner of the world (this seems to be how most are expressing their thoughts) are missing the bigger picture.

Sidebar - imho, re-deploy is controversial because it had good and bad things included. I'd be down to see re-worked versions. But, until they can offer tweaks, the overall health of Fortnite (and ergo, the pro scene) is better off without re-deploy as it was in its ""current"" state.",FortniteCompetitive

Change my mind,"First off, I was not the biggest fan of the re-deploy system. I do believe it had upsides, but also had many downsides. With glider re-deploy you could use it as many times as you wanted, could third party as much as you want, and could be an absolute high ground warrior without caring about fall damage. The great thing was easy rotations and disengaging from terrible situations. 

Now that glider re-deploy is out, you actually have to think about how you use your mats and how high you build because you can and WILL get knocked down by somebody. You also can't glide around the map just looking for two people fighting to third party. 

I've seen a lot of people saying how rotating to the circle is all RNG based, but I don't find that necessarily to be true. They added a 100% spawn rate to quadcrashers and they are pretty much everywhere but the Southwest portion of the map. The only RNG is the plethora of other mobility items such as balloons, shockwave nades, and grapplers. You also have corrupted zones that have shadow stones which can help you rotate. 

Dropping on the edge of the map should have some type of downside and removing re-deploy gives you that downside, BUT there are still many ways to easily rotate to the storm; you just have to either waste an inventory slot or risk being heard by others when driving a quadcrasher.

The fact that you are just as accurate as an silenced AR and you cannot be hit while using it it, its just a minor bonus. It has so many counters as well. The enemy could dc, they could have a stroke irl or their house might set on fire. I feel like they did a lot of research before adding it to the game and it really motivates me to keep playing. Why spend 10000 of hours practising building when its all in vein while facing a turret that shoots 100000000 bullets per second and it almost never stops while doing 40dmg per hit. WHY? Why use ARs or shotguns as a matter of fact, all you need is a full inventory of meds and a few turrets and some mats(100 should do it) and you can win a game. EZ PEEZY LEMON SQUEEZY.

While I’m against redeploy being completely removed (I think the adjustments they made to how you can no longer sky dive with it made the mechanic balanced). 

The point that I would like to make is that in the discussion that I’m seeing a lot of people are using points such as “I hate being consistently dove on by new teams.” The problem with this is that people are generally referring to public matches when making these claims. When talking about these giant meta changes we need to think about how they affect scrims/customs that’s why we’re all here right, for competitive Fortnite?

For example redeploy has made rotations significantly more RNG. It’s much easier to be storm gated now that you have to rely on RNG utility for mobility. With bouncers and redeploy being gone this game is extremely slow. And you have to burn a lot more mats on rotate end game compared to someone who gets a lucky circle. 

I love this game and I want to see it be as competitive as possible meaning minimizing RNG as much as possible in a BR. In my opinion glider redeploy did just that. Sure it needs some tweaking but I think the idea in itself was a good one.

Also just as an aside, is more fighting and more 3rd partying a bad thing in pubs? Idk about y’all but I’m just trying to get into as many fights and rack up as many kills as possible. 

Let me know your thoughts, hopefully I expressed my points correctly and coherently.

Throughout every patch I have stuck it out, even when glider redeploy getting introduced seemed to me the worst patch possible. After playing this patch I am convinced that I will be reducing my time put into this game severely which I have never said before. There are two major flaws with the removal of redployable gliders: A subjective combat change to tactical players and an objective pacing flaw for the community.

The subjective flaw is it reduces the potential power of a player which once again makes it nearly impossible for a player of my caliber (competitive but NOT pro level) to play solo squads and perform clutch plays in most scenarios. I can deal with this outcome, but it feels extremely bad to once again only win 10% of solo squads because it is hard to combat the massive bullet output of four players. Regardless of its massive benefit in combat this flaw that many people complain about has no bearing on my choice to play the game. It is understandable that there are combat problems with gliders, so I wanted to acknowledge them

The objective pacing flaw is that many of us have become addicted to the fast movement speed provided by the gliders. To me games are entertaining because of a cycle of desire and satisfaction. A game that successfully makes you desire something while allowing you to satisfy those desires without disrupting the cycle is entertaining. For example you may desire good loot, but if every game was solid gold you would no longer desire good loot, and reducing loot to 1% of current spawns would cause people to no longer be able to satisfy this desire. The balance is key, but by adding gliders in the game has allowed people to satisfy many desires such as looting, grouping up, rotations, and storm evasion. Now the game feels sluggish and tedious because everything is slowed down massively reducing our ability to satisfy desires. Nothing in this game feels worse than trying to get a high kill win and only being able to find 5-7 people in a game without landing tilted.

After tonight I have decided to take a 5-7 day break from Fortnite, which will be the second longest break I have ever taken from this game. I am not attempting to boycott or demand a change with this break; I want to enjoy this game again, I really do. I'm hoping that after 5 days I can go back to my usual grind and learn to deal with the frustrating reality of less satisfaction. If you have any thoughts regarding this issue please reply or add me on epic (LayneTheBane) so we can talk. Thank you epic for the best development team in history. ",FortniteCompetitive

You leave yourself more exposed, rather than put a wall right after pumping them and then going for another shot (ora quick finish with an AR, if you know you've hit them for 1XX+).

the thing is that the latter approach, while way more safe, sometimes takes longer to execute (as in, it would sometimes take you longer to finish a fight, and that can cost you as well, seeing how if someone 3rd parties then instead of being done with the first guy, you now have to deal with 2). Also, sometimes the guy would turtle/ turbo-build, and an SMG would catch them off-guard and get a quick kill. I am assuming that a wall replacement would also be valid, but again - it sometimes takes a while with turbo-build..

What is your guys' approach?

Please note that I'm not talking about the technical aspect of that - obviously a pump and wall (with edits and what not) also takes more skill, but that is something that you can learn and master overtime (I believe), so don't take that into a consideration.

Lifesteal helps with the issues that came from third parties swantoning when you were weak. I think that this could probably be increased to maybe 75? A body pump shot does 80/85 so it's not uncommon to take about that amount of damage vs any good player. 

I think a ""matsteal"" would round this all up and make this perfect if you could get 200/100/50 after a kill or something along those lines.

This would eliminate all the main arguments against glider redoploy while giving us an overall better experience, especially from a competitive standpoint. This would put comp fortnite in its best state ever, imo.

Read it and weep all you wanna be pro’s on here that in reality are just sweat lords that have made $0 off the game. These are real pros and they support glider redeploy. Will that help offset your brainwashing? Or will you continue to incoherently ramble about third partying? It’s a fucking battle royale game. Third partying is inevitable. You guys can enjoy your scenic walking tutorial with occasional gunfights. I refuse to play this shit until glider redeploy is back. Made the game fast paced and people actually took build battles. Now the low ground plebs who can’t build are back in power. Good job subreddit, good job.

I urge all administrators to do vod reviews before making drastic decisions.,"So my friend lands Lazy with his teammate as they always do. For some reason, a lot of other players decide to land there as well, and his teammate gets knocked almost instantly in the chaos. My friend leaves Lazy to run for the sand bunkers to get a weapon. He spots a guy running around alone in the open field and goes for the knock (Razzzero0os teammate was behind a hill, so it looked like the guy was alone). He was basically sandwiched between the people in lazy and Razz, so he decided to go for the surprise knock on the single guy in front of him. When he knocks him he sees that its Razz, and decides not to kill him as he's scared he'll get banned. You can even see in the clip that he's hesitating to kill him. If he was really after clout or trying to stream snipe, wouldn't he have finished Razz off? It's also pretty absurd that players should be scared of engaging players out of fear of it being an admin or pro player. My friend gets eliminated and after being accused of being a stream sniper and having a lot of insults thrown at him, he gets an immediate ban.   


I urge all administrators of discords to go over VOD reviews before banning people. A 30 second look at the vod would have made it obvious that my friend had no idea who he was engaging with. It sucks that aspiring competitive players are being kept away from good practice because of small things like this.  


This is nothing against Razz personally, I understand that it must be frustrating as hell to deal with stream snipers all the time. I also understand it would look sketchy from the POV of Razz being rushed by a single guy, but thats because he's not thinking about the circumstances (meaning my friend running away from lazy with no weapon and being sandwiched 1v2 between several teams and Razz who SEEMED to be all by himself.)

I would like to remind the community and epic that while the tournament system provides a very good possible solution for pro players constantly being bored of pubs, no below average or average player will likely ever get the opportunity to play consistently in lobbys filled with players of their own skill level.

It makes it difficult to ever improve your ability at this game, consigns many players to LTMs, and discourages new players from joining the game as you get repeatedly destroyed. Ultimately this freezes bad players out of the competitive community altogether, likely dissuading the players from ever following the esport in the way that a more traditional ranked system would not.

I play a shitload of skrims (or more or less nothing else atm) and the zones we have now are a bit problematic.



Why? Because the second moving zone is a total RNG death trap. 



It is intended to be a death trap with gliders.



Now without them it is litteraly the most random and crazy thing in the entire game killing people left and right even though they made no mistake the enitre game long.



I understand that RNG always has a certain amount of RNG in  it but this is just redicioules without gliders.



People who didnt find a grappler, rift to go, jumppad etc. just die now. 




The only reason why this was actually bearable was bc of gliders and their abilitie to rotate relativly fast. Even though dropping high was always a big loss in those zones. 



Also I wanna add that without glider redeploy the game is much slower now. And here comes the problem. 



Most competetive players are ADDICTED to speed and enjoy it, just look mongraals enthusiasm when playing fornite. He wants to be the fastet at everything. 


Speed is like a drug and if you increase the speed of an already addicting game it becomes better and you adjust to the speed. Now they took it out again it becomes way more boring.

But anyone that has played pubs today and landed on a roof with another player probably agrees with me that the 20 damage pick-axe is ridiculous. Consider the following situation, which I have experienced today more than once. Two people land on the roof of a house to break through for chest/guns. Assuming that you hit your circles, it will take 5 swings of the pick-axe to break through the roof. Now before this update, it would take 10 pick-axe swings to kill, meaning that if some oblivious default skin was annoyingly pickaxing you, you had plenty of time to break through, grab a gun and melt him. Now it only takes 5 pick-axe swings to kill, the same amount that it takes to get through the roof. This makes it a viable if not encouraged option for one to pick-axe the other to death before they can even break through the roof and get a gun. Personally I find it not only extremely annoying, but unhealthy for the game. Although realistically peaking this is probably just another noob-catering update to let little Timmy get a kill when someone beats him to the chest so who knows if it will ever get taken out.

The circle came on them so i had to move. There was no natural cover on my way. 

I had to constantly build to move to the Circle as both of them were sitting in their 2×2 base spraying me simultaneously with their turret.

I had a heavy sniper so i tried to take a shot multiple times but the angle was me looking upwards and i could not even see their heads with that turret in front of them .

U can see the head if u look straight but not from this angle.

I tagged them both on the feet as it was the only thing i could see.

its such a joke to see this video when u add to the fact that he was playing in a streamer tournament when hes suppose to be a pro player. Also he had a chance to play in the ""Real"" competitive tournament with his partner Hamlinz who was also playing in the tournament for Streamers. Everyone knows at this point that TSM has done pretty poor in the competitive tournaments that fortnite has hosted. And from what i can tell no one in TSM is committed to getting better at competitive fortnite besides Myth, he being the only member of TSM to scrim regularly. And the worst part about TSM, not being Competitve and trying to get better is that they are like one of the only Fortnite teams that have a team house. Oh and i forgot to add that they kicked a member out for not scrimming and playing the game enough.

So No guys TSM Myth is not back and i have a final question for you guys. How can anyone continue to call TSM a Pro Team. At this point they are just a team of Content Creators/ Streamers that live together ",FortniteCompetitive

These things are absolutely amazing against players that knock you down. You only need to pop one single balloon to be safe from any height. If you feel like you are getting knocked down, pull out one balloon and you will be safe from any falldmg.

The only negative is that you glide down slightly slower than usual fall.

To counteract that, you can pull out the balloon while falling. Once you start hearing the ""whizzing"" when falling down, you activate it and you wont take falldmg. Figuring out the heights will take some practice because I wasnt able to come up with fixed height from jumping down and popping it midair. It is important to actually jump up before going down, as it gives you more buffer for pulling the balloon

As a rule of thumb, pop the ballon at roughly half the height where you were jumping down from (so when 8 blocks up, activate the balloon at maybe 4,5 blocks above the ground). You will still be falling at a much faster speed, but wont take dmg and you can continue building the second you hit the ground.

As a prediction, players who want to play highground will have to run balloons, having 20 free falls is very good for that kind of playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

On another note, with the new glider deployment height after using rifts, you can only barely use the rift a second time, if you are not the one using a rift, you cannot glide down fast enough to use it again, giving the escaping party a significant advantage.

Also jump fatigue starts after 2 jumps, doing three 90s in a row is heavily edges inconsistency (you are literally getting phased up a lot for the third 90)",FortniteCompetitive

You will realise how much you miss re-deployment after a few days playing fortnite.,"Epic Games should have stood it’s ground with this mechanic. I know that 90% community at first didn’t like it at first, but after a few days it was actually more engaging to play. 

Yes I understand 3rd partying but I have never enjoyed it as much as I did. For the first time game play wasn’t a running simulator anymore and it was more fun and engaging. This mechanic made it so you had to think fast on your feet and got your twitches and reactions to being able to fend off multiple enemies under constant pressure. 

Epic has been trying to nerf building but this mechanic allowed us to have great builds. “At the cost of resources and 3rd partying” you would say but it was actually fun and it was a risk that you would take if you wanted to play. You can’t build like you did back in season 1 and 2 these days but this mechanic allowed us to do so but now that’s gone again. 

I’m a season 1 player and I quit 2 months ago but came back  and found re-deployment to be really great and engaging. You don’t realise it but the Re-deployment mechanic would actually help you at taking on 3-4 opponents at a time under extreme pressure and your would help raise your awareness during tough build offs.
Building is what separates fortnite to every other Battleroyal and I know this because I have Blackout and it’s pretty much just a battlefield FPS game but you only have 1 life = boring and no creativity. 

I think people are going to realise how much they miss the Re-deployment mechanic after a few days of playing fortnite again with the reverted settings. We really screwed this up as a community just like the double pumps and shotguns ",FortniteCompetitive

The speculative reason for this extension is because glider redeploy was first introduced during Fortnitemares, where the data collected was vastly skewed by dozens of zombies.

Now that they have had more than a week of testing without zombies, they are taking it away as it was just that, a test. Now with data from 2+ weeks they will continue to work on a feature in a competitive test environment that they are also making available for us to use! 

Seriously guys, it was never meant to be a permanent thing and was always going to get taken away for more internal tweaking before a full release.


TL;DR: GD was announced as a week-long test, extended due to the fortnitemares debacle, and is now being taken away as it was never meant to stay permanently hence the word “test.” ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

For months I have seen this subreddit criticizing decisions Epic has made in regards to competitive play/state of the game.  A lot of the criticisms are valid.  For instance, a lot of material nerf complaints were valid.  Drum gun complaints were valid.  The P90 complaints upon release were definitely valid.  Along with these valid complaints were the overwhelming sentiment that Epic needs to listen to the opinions of the pro players who agreed that these decisions were big problems for the state of the game....

&amp;#x200B;

Until the opinions of the masses and the pro players don't align.  Glider redeploy threw a big wrench in the works.  It's a very controversial change that seems to not have much support among this subreddit/FortniteBR.  Much like with previous controversial changes, there are posts every day which complain about the glider redeploy changes and how it ruins the game and the dynamics.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that pro/competitive players like the change.  Of course, there are a few pros that have unfavorable opinions on glider redeploy, but overall the large majority of pros are now in favor of glider redeploy as a mechanic.  And therein lies the issue for this subreddit...do we want Epic to listen to the pros or listen to the casual playerbase?

&amp;#x200B;

Like it or not, most readers/posters of this sub are a part of the casual playerbase.  It's not an insult, it's just the way it is.  Unless you are a member of the pro/player league discord or are signed to a team or getting paid to play this game, etc...you are a member of the casual playerbase.  There is a big difference between competitive play and the public matches that we play daily...you do not experience the changes from a competitive perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

But when a change that almost all pros argue is good for the competitive scene is reverted, there is an overwhelming favorable response to the revert.

&amp;#x200B;

So do we want Epic to listen to the pros opinions or the casual playerbase, because we cannot keep switching sides whenever it fits our needs...it takes away the credibility of this sub.  Healthy discussion and disagreement with decisions and patches is fine, but it is kind of messed up when the majority of the competitive subreddit disregards the opinions of the actual competitive players on the changes.",FortniteCompetitive

Firstly I am a console player. I have tried to use a mouse in other games such as CS:GO but I don’t have a PC currently at college so my Xbox gets the job done. 

Myth said that he was confused about why aim assist is in the game if console players are saying it doesn’t make a difference compared to a mouse. I believe that aim assist is in the game to close the gap between using a mouse and using a controller. Your hand and arm obviously has more stability compared to your thumbs which is why aim assist isn’t a thing with a mouse. To compensate for this precision aim assist is used so that console players can still hit a similar amount of shots. 

Does it give you a significant advantage shooting? Probably. Tracking is easier with aim assist for medium range. But using a mouse is still extremely advantageous compared to a controller. Unless you play on 10 sensitivity you can’t hit a 180 flick shot like you can with a mouse. With a controller you can’t shoot at one enemy and change directions to another who is 70 m apart. With a mouse you can. 

Tldr: Aim assist is used to close the gap between a controller and a mouse to allow controller players to compete and hit a similar amount of shots. ",FortniteCompetitive

The pros liked it (a lot agreed that it should be nerfed but most agreed it should stay to an extent)/ content creators didn't

It encouraged buildfights, and took away the option of bot third parties shooting them down because they couldn't build

It took away the RNG in scrims of late game circles

It also took away RNG of ping spikes messing up your builds so that you would(nt) fall to your death

Etc

In short, RIP redeploy: you will be missed. The vocal minority took away the best update for scrims this game has had just because, on the internet, being anti-something is easier than saying something should stay",FortniteCompetitive

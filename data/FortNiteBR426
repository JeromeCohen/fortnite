Only the cheater gets banned- not the friends of the cheater who reaped the *same* benefits of said cheating.

Few games ban players by association.  I'd like to see Fortnite BR be part of that list of games who have zero tolerance for *all* forms of cheating.

You'd have to be a clueless gamer to play frequently with a friend and not know they're cheating.  And in most cases when groups get caught, they always play dumb and pretend they didn't know.  It's not until it's clear their ban isn't getting lifted that they show their true colors and get hostile over getting caught and being dragged down with their trash tier cheating friend.

Edit:  To avoid any confusion, a player can **only** be considered ""associated"" with a cheater if they're on each other's friendlist and they play together while the cheating is going on **numerous** times.",FortNiteBR

First of all thanks for all of you who submitted your name and what was missing to me, that helped me track down a bug in my query that was pulling your stats. It was looking for a specific piece of data to calculate your placement but if you let the server time out and got kicked after your win, the server was never sending me that event. 


Luckily we have other ways to collect that data (so don't worry, it's not lost) and our process has been corrected.


Unfortunately, the fix will require another backfill of data which can only occur during downtime. Right now we are still working on the schedule of when our next downtime will be, but once we have it, I'll be able to insert all of your precious missing datas (which was about 10% of wins and all kills that occurred in those wins).


Sorry about that!

I woke up this morning and every time I try to get in a solo match I get kicked shortly after jumping out of the bus saying I'm permanently banned for cheating.  Super bummed as I definitely didn't cheat.  It doesn't seem coincidental this happens right after the addition of the report button; I was hiding in bushes most of the match and I know that play style rustles some jimmies but it was a legitimate win and I'm disappointed I'm banned because of this.  Is there any way to reverse this?  I know I can make another account but I was excited for the iron umbrella and to finally view all my stats.  Thanks

Edit: I don't care if you think I'm lying, I'm looking for legitimate help.  I want to know how to get epic to review my account, not that you think I should get fucked by the banhammer.   I emailed them but I thought this community might have a bit more insight on the issue

It's everything I need in a Battle Royale game. There is just one problem, being thrown into a random squad and being the victim of team killing. 

Now, apparently the Devs don't consider team killing a banable offense. I can't be the only person frustrated by this horrible aspect of the game. I don't want to have to avoid this match type just because of team killing. It's sad the Devs have done nothing about this or even batted an eye.

I would just like some answers on why this is aloud in squads.  Let alone the game itself. This should be a banable offense no ifs, ands, or buts. Better yet, just take it out of the game.

I know some people who don't really feel gratified with a win unless they've at least had their fair share of fights during a match, i.e. 3 or 4 kills minimum. When they make it to the top 10 ""by chance,"" never being in any real conflicts and maybe having no kills, it doesn't feel earned to them.

Some of my friends even go as far as to TALK SMACK on people who ""hide"" or avoid fights to make it to top 10, hoping they can weasel their way into a win.

What do you guys think? Of course there's no wrong way to play the game, but how do YOU feel towards these tactics?

I personally think a mix of both occasional avoidance and not being afraid of a fight is key. For example, when I see two people inevitably heading toward each other in a house, does it make me a coward to allow them to fight each other down, then immediately jump the winner as he is collecting the loot?

We all like to show off that tier 5 chestpiece in WoW or that golden weapon in overwatch. Hard to achieve status based cosmetics are fun and motivating. I don't really care about the achievements in overwatch for example because there is no good way to showcase them.

A good hybrid system that respects the F2P business model would be certain epic/legendary cosmetic items being achievement locked to equip but still need to be opened or bought with ingame credits.

**Example**

Achievement: Bolt Hero - Deal 500 damage with the bolt sniper rifle

Cosmetic: Golden Bolt Rifle (legendary) (achievement locked - Bolt Hero) - All bolt rifles you equip ingame are gold

* You can open the Golden Bolt Rifle and own it but it can't be equipped until you have the achievement.

* If you earn a rare achievement it might be motivation to use your saved up credits on the associated legendary cosmetic item.

* If you own a legendary cosmetic you might be super motivated to complete that achievement. You may have several items in your collection you can't equip because you haven't completed associated achievements.

* Some achievements / associated items are incredibly difficult and will end up as status symbols in the pregame lobbies (ie. 20 kill achievement)",FortNiteBR

In the ensuing shit show I got knocked down to like 20 HP but survived and went up to hide on the roof. Long story short, the building I was hiding in was somehow the EXACT center of the storm every time it closed, so I stayed on this roof and built a couple wood walls in my blind spots. Literally didn’t leave my roof (one stray bullet could kill me) as I watched several people murder each other in the distance and the player countdown slowly ticked down to 10. 

At this point bullets are whizzing past me from people taking cover but nobody is rushing the house (they prob think I’m armed up, still only 2 shitty guns). I drop down into the attic and watch the player count drop down to 3 as bullets ring out around me and rockets start blowing the shit out of other rooms. At this point I drop further down to the living room and hide behind a dining room table, figuring I’m finally screwed. In walks a dude and heart pumping as he aims at me, I pull the trigger, one shotting him in the head with my shitty grey shotgun as he explodes into a rain of not blood but of purple and blue gear. I imagine the long drawn out “fuuuuuuck” he is probably making wherever he is. I legit felt slightly bad. 

Well I got what was coming to me as the circle now ends up out on the lawn, and the last guy has built a huge-ass brick fort. My only option is to run out, guns blazing, as the guy pops out and lights me up from one of his many nooks. Anticlimactic end but my heart has never pounded so much in this game and I’ve never felt so lucky but terrible at the same time for what I did to the other guy. Love this game! ",FortNiteBR

But more and more streamers and players are proclaiming FP mode is superior and watching people play FPS mode just... is so boring.

But here in FBR, the 3rd person mode makes this game so much more interesting than FPS games for me, as someone who prefers TPS over FPS.

I have waited for nearly 6 years for a game to get off the FPS crazy and take to TPS because almost no one builds a TPS anymore. I mean there was Gears of War, but Epic skipped 2 and 3 on PC and the other versions... It was really a console game to be fair.  Anyways to keep from rambling forever, the last time I really got into a serious TPS game was S4League

Now that FBR is here that Itch of wanting to play a TPS game again has been scratched and by god do I fucking love it.

Please Epic, PLEASE, do not put FPS mode into this game, Please stay true to the TPS design. It makes me so happy to play a shooting game again that is hard focused on TPS mode and mechanics. FPS mode killed the specator experience of pub for me. ",FortNiteBR

It's fun action packed and more casual/chill than other BR's out there.

I have put over 30 hours into the game and feel the biggest issues are the shields and health.

Shields give you such an advantage its insane. There quick to use and give you such a boost in 1v1 scenarios that a guy with 100hp compared to one with 200hp the guy with 100 stands little chance of winning. 

The first way this needs to be looked at is visually. Right now you have no way of knowing if a player has a shield or not until you're shooting them. Lets take an example from PUBG. If i have a sniper and aim in on someones head if they have a level 1 or 2 helmet i know it will instantly kill then but if they have a level 3 i will know it won't and think is it worth the shot shooting this person.

Another thing PUBG does right (Which it does very little tbh) Is that the balance of armor is great. Level 3 isn't insanely better and everyone will have armor meaning the difference is always about the gun fights yes you may be able to take another shot but compare that to Fortnite where if someone has even just 50 shield that will be around 2 more AR shots. 4 if they have a hundred shield...

Now add on top health which i feel is to hard to obtain. If you drop, kill a few, have a ton of bandages but only have 75 health you're at such a huge disadvantage and the only way you can get full HP is a med kit. 

I don't know how to really change this issue but makes fights feel unfair to an extreme length. It feels so meh dying when you have 100HP and you were clearly better than your opponent who had 200 and you see them only at 20HP after the fight. The reason they lived? they had a shield.

TLDR: Shields and health need to be looked at. There needs to be more med kits and shields shouldn't give such an advantage and should have a visual design to. ",FortNiteBR

3. Transport. 
Maybe a hoverboard/bike that will fit in with the aesthetics of the game. Not too fast and not much armour making it fair.

This has happened before but fixed itself up until last night's CLIENT update. When I try to launch the game through the launcher the ""Launch"" button turns gray and says ""Busy"", after a couple minutes of that a timer pops up in replace of the button that says [""Waiting in line"" with a 2 minute timer](https://i.imgur.com/fRGnhuU.jpg), after that an [error message pops up with the code LS-0015.](https://i.imgur.com/k8QgBkr.png)

When I launch the game using the executable it opens the game quickly, but when I queue up I am [unable to connect to the matchmaking service](https://i.imgur.com/hZa9NYs.png).

I have tried verifying my game files, don't have a firewall enabled, and tried flushing my DNS. My brother is able to launch the game fine (without waiting in line) through the launcher and has no problems connecting to the matchmaking servers. It was working fine last night before the client was updated.

Simple suggestion, make it so you can't headshot with a shotgun. Sure I'll probably be downvoted for this, but it's logical and would be nice to use other weapons for close range.

Multiple times today I've had my team mate shooting at the person and instead of defending themselves they just try to full kill me before they die. Specifically with the shotgun, which is so prevent and powerful in the current meta, you can easily 2 if not 1 shot a downed person. I understand why you need to be able to kill downed people since maybe they're queueing with a fill that is on the other side of the map, but I really think it should be a little harder or at least give you a little more time for your teammates to respond.


the two ideas I had were: 

1. Invulnerable to damage for the first 25% of your health bleeding, but take away the ability to crawl away

2. armored hp, maybe 1/2 damage from everything but 1/3 from shot guns for the first 50% of your downed HP bar.

Let people who know how to aim on their own be able to do so. Nothing worse than aiming at someone while they are not moving only to have your crosshair jump when they move or someone runs by them. Skill for the shooting is removed at that point. It is just a positioning game. I know I am not the only one because it is ALL over the threads. That is why I am so shocked they did nothing about it. All I do now (since aiming is pointless) is run up scope in and shoot. Scope out then scope in and shoot. Literally no aiming at all. How am I killing people like that? Seems like a feature for offline. Sad days.",FortNiteBR

So the things already in place to kick idle players is the literal storm. Active players will stay in the eye while the idle players die outside. I hope that when the game says Idle they mean AFK and not trying to push players to run around the map even when they find a good hiding place.

*Being that this game is cartoony rather than realistic, it'd be fun if gunfights lasted a bit longer. Headshots should remain crucial, but many items can kill players quickly if they don't have armor even without a headshot.*

* Remove weapon bloom

*You can see that many modern day shooters use this mechanic and it's always the same, no one likes it. It doesn't do much but punish people who are skilled by forcing them to time their shots. This mechanic is so terrible in fortnite battle royal that it prevents you from aiming accurately while even standing. I would love the idea of shooting accurately while moving, standing, jumping, and pacing left to right. Bring back the old school Unreal Tournament mechanics you guys had. Don't fix a system that was never broken or add one that majority dislike.*

* Add dodge

*Another great thing that we had in Unreal Tournament is that we can dash. However nowadays new systems came out such as dodge. Would be pretty badass rolling on the ground and shooting up players at the same time. It would also be a great way of preventing a headshot.*

Right now the game tries to be realistic, while not being it at the same time. Break that barrier and give us some more action in gunfights. I believe it'll be perfect for a game like this. Just some feedback.",FortNiteBR

Doors:
Doors should be the first thing you pay attention to when approaching a building. Doors always start closed. If a door is open, someone has been there or is currently there. 
I typically close doors behind me and when leaving a building. This means if another player runs through the area they're more likely to waste time looking through a building I've already looted. 


Building:
Remember, there are actually several shapes and objects you can build. By holding circle while in the building UI you can edit whatever you're currently building. So if you're putting up a wall, ""deleting"" the two squares in the center creates a door. 
Make sure to experiment with the different shapes you can use, some are going to be more effective than others. 
Even if you're not interested in getting ""fancy"" with your builds, practice this portion. It WILL become part of any meta in the future and having the muscle memory and ability to quickly switch in and out of build mode will help you immensely. 


Map:
Learn the map. This one just takes time and experience. Learn the landmarks on the map so that you don't have to bring up your map to get an idea of where you're at.


Markers:
Use your markers! Even if you're dropping solo, use your markers. Placing a marker at the location you're heading to ensures you can easily track your direction and keep you from getting distracted and turned around


Pick your fights wisely:
You just saw an enemy running across a field. Should you engage? There's a lot of factors to consider. What weapon do they currently have out? Is it better range than what you've got? What's the terrain look like? Are you at an advantage for cover, height, etc.?
Just because you see someone doesn't mean you have to or even should engage. Don't blindly fire at everyone you run across. You're just going to wind up giving away your location more often than not. 


Relocate:
I know bushes tend to be real popular at the moment, but camping a single spot after shooting at someone typically isn't a great idea, with a few exceptions. It's not hard to locate other players based on sound in this game. It may not exactly pinpoint you, but it will draw attention to the cover areas in your vicinity making people more actively scan for you. You don't have to run across the map to relocate, but moving to another area in your general vicinity is much better than sitting in a single spot the entire time tactically. 


Traps:
There's a lot of... well let's just say not everyone agrees that they're useful. Me personally, I believe any item in the game that causes damage to an enemy opponent is useful. Use them. Place them in unexpected areas. I don't think, at least right now, they're very useful in late game, but early and mid game is where you can find some utility for them. Even if a trap doesn't secure a kill or knockdown, that still creates a situation where a player has to use healing items from the inventory. 


Barrier:
One popular tactic is to actually hang out outside of the barrier perimeter in mid and early games. You'll need a lot of bandages though. You should know the DPS of the barrier at your current stage. First = 1dps, Second = 2dps, and so on. Getting caught in the barrier isn't a death sentence and as long as you don't panic you'll have little to worry about most times. Unless you got distracted and are just too far to make it to the new area. Every round I see ""Downed by the storm"" a few times. Don't let this be you! (Remember to use those markers)


Early Game:
This is usually the most frantic portion of the game (with end of round being the exception sometimes) Learning and knowing the map is probably one of the most important things to do for early game. It allows you to know where to land, when to jump, what to expect, and where to start running after you hit the ground. You should be moving and collecting at this stage. Picking fights is entirely up to you at this point. This is what I consider the ""run and gun"" stage. 


Mid Game:
After the circle has been established and the timer has started ticking down it's time to start thinking about where you want to be when that circle closes. You should have a couple of your preferred weapons at this point. You want to try and make it to this point as unscathed as possible. This is where things start getting scarce and you're more likely to be drawn into firefights. The important thing to remember here is keeping an eye on the circle and timer. Know your area and how to get to the next one.


Late Game:
This is the point where hopefully you're running around stalking and being stalked by the last 20 players or so. At this point you're playing a more ""traditional"" FFA style game on a relatively small map (as the circle closes). Range starts becoming less of a factor as the circle size decreases. You should have at least 2 locations in your mind at this point inside the circle. 
This is where you'll need to start making decisions about fortifications. Do you build and defend? Do you run and gun? Do you camp and wait? Most of this is going to simply depend on your personal play style, skills, and situation at the time. 


This is not by ANY means a comprehensive list or deep strategies. Just some tips I think might help new players get acclimatized to the game, the mode, and the objective. Hopefully you'll find something useful to help you get that umbrella!",FortNiteBR

You could cancel the gliding at any height, fall damage applies.

There could easily be 5-6 placed around the map, giving people the ability to use them to travel faster to the circle as needed.

Pros:

* Faster Travel
* Fits with the lore/style of the game
* Requires no additional RNG of finding items or vehicles around the map
* Adds objective points around the map, creating objective points for more battles

Cons:

* Vulnerable while flying
* More I'm sure someone will think of!

The only reason to play this game any further after about 30 wins and 60Hrs playtime in BR is to push your statistics. 

so they said ""There will be stats and leaderboards soon"" and i'm like: **FINALLY ! YES!** 

no need to say how disappointed i was after i saw what they called ""stats"". 

We got like 6 numbers. That's what they call stats ?

* Longest Headshot

* Longest Kill streak

* Longest Win streak

* Walls/roofs placed

* Favourite gun

* Kills with gun X/Y

* Time camped

* Life lost

For those unfamiliar with the R6 or how the system works, it is directly aimed at punishing repeat TK offenders by kicking them from the match and preventing them from connecting to the servers for an initial 15 minute period and then the punishments gradually increase to 30 minutes, 1 hour, 24 hours etc until an inevitable ban hammer is dropped.

R6 usually triggers getting kicked from the game after the second or third team kill if you are first time offender. If you are a high volume offender and then it usually kicks in on the 1st team kill and your ban time increases.

The whole point of the system is that it allows for the occasional TK, which normally happens either on accident or when a squad regularly play together and they are messing about, but it shuts down the people that intentionally go out of there way to demolish the gameplay experience for others by tracking the over all amount of team kills they have along with the frequency.

Just a thought and obviously could be tweaked to suit this game better as accidentally team killing someone in Battle Royale is a lot less common.

I like how fast paced this game is and when we talk about body shots the TTK is really god in my opinion. It doesn't take ages to shred an opponent and when you are getting shot at you still have time to react. But when we take headshots and it's high multiplier (2.5x) into account it's a whole different story.

Due to the rng loot system you can find yourselfe often enough without a shield and only 75 hp. With the 2.5x multiplier a white assault rifle with a base damage of 32 will headshot you for 80 hp, one hit killing you right away. With the current state of bullet spread this just doesnt feel right in my opinion.

How often have i engaged someone from behind just to see him turn around and one hit kill me with a rifle. Aim should be rewarded for sure but with all the factors like not beeing able to full heal with bandages, rng availability of health packs and shield potions and the kinda rng based bullet spread on assault rifles, i feel like they could trim down the headshot multiplier a bit.

Maybe 1.75x or 2x?

What do you guys think about this?

**TL;DR**

Is the headshot multiplier too high and makes the ttk too short and rng based? Does it need adjustments or is everything ok?

This is very usefull for longrange kills with a rocketlauncher since your opponent will usually feel safe if there is only 1 rocket flying across his direction, especially if they have metal walls since they will anticipate the walls just tank the shot and hide inside.

**It works like this:** You pre-aim the opening of their base ( https://i.imgur.com/kZ9rJXw.png ) with the scope and since rockets go dead center in the middle of where you are aiming, you can just switch to the launcher and send them a nice little present

Really, they kinda feel like a placebo effect. I guess sometimes the Purple SCAR feels better. But all M4s feel the same. Same with all variants of the rest of the weapons. 

So I had some ideas to make them truly unique.

Tactical SMG - I saw someone say that the Tact SMGs should come with a suppressor. I think that would bring some stealth into the game. And as the variants go up, it should have more in the mag.

M4 - As the variants go up, it should have better accuracy. Strafing, crouching, etc. Just overall feel better.

Purple SCAR - Should have better accuracy and maybe damage to headshots? I don't know.

Yellow SCAR - Reload faster, do more damage to objects. Like built things, trees, etc.

Most pistols I can't really think of much. Or the normal SMGs.

Shotguns - Less spread as they go up. Pump shotgun should have slightly quicker pump action. 

I mean, this is all theoretical. Not like they'll listen to me. Leave you suggestions below so Epic can see them.

Snipers - At this point in time to my knowledge they only reload faster. They should have better velocity (faster bullet travel) or the bolt action should have more in the mag.

SMGs should be very good close range. They should tickle you from range, but devastate you close range. Like a shotgun, but not as much range.

Purple tactical does some pretty damage. But all the other SMGs I might as well be hitting someone with a pickaxe.

I think they need some more love. Most times I'd rather have a common pistol rather than a blue SMG. They should be so good when you're close to someone. And it's not like buffing them would change the game. It would just mean some people will choose an SMG over the shotty if they choose so.

And I'm not trying to argue this. From my personal experience &amp; with friends (8 different people) they've all agreed SMGs are weak. And whenever I get into a gunfight with someone who has one, I win 100% of the time.

I've won games without using bushes and I've won games with using them for occasional cover.  I think as bushes currently stand they are negatively effecting the game.

The first couple solo games I won were a ton of fun.  As it got down to the last 6 or so people you had everyone building forts, rotating around the map and trying to flank using trees as cover.  I've noticed now what tends to happen is one or two people will build a fort and the rest will take cover in a bush and wait until someone runs past or the other start fighting and take a couple shots.

I like the idea of some forms of stealth in this game but I think the main issue is the large bushes that basically cover the player model 100%.

Epic made a choice not to add the ability to lie prone in this game and I think initially it made the game a lot more fun.  It was more action oriented and players that kept moving to high ground and building cover tended to win.  The last few days this has changed.

I tend to enjoy skill games and dislike anything that allows RNG/luck to overcome skill.  As it is right now if you pick a bush that covers your player model and get luck enough to have the circle keep shrinking on you you have a HUGE advantage over other players.

What are your thoughts?

I think a simple solution would be to lower the largest bushes so that they can still work as cover but also allow anyone that give it a careful look to see your character model.

Current Build:

- Being able to move while looking in the inventory menu. Sometimes you want to rotate towards the next circle or town and you need to quickly reorganize your loot without having to stop because the storm is moving in. You don't want to get caught up in the storm with your pants down or your weapons unorganized once you reach that circle. 
- A way to unload ammo from weapons, just to be more efficient with ammo for weapons of the same type. suchs when you just reloaded a weapon and then you find a green of the same type, but your inventory is full. Damn now you're down 30 ammo of the 60 you had or you lose a previous weapon slot because you value that weapon type over others.
- A way to differentiate if a person is inside a building or not. I had a situation where it seemed like I was chasing a guy around a building, but they were indeed on the 2nd floor of a building. pubg solved this by adding hollow foot step sound inside buildings to help people improve the audio clarity of a person's location.
- Minimap (top right square on your screen, some people thought i was talking about the map that you open with 'M' the last time I brought this up) still gives an unwanted blind spot, especially when you're creeping into one of the last circles, I had a guy barely out of his FOV and completely inside my FOV be blocked by my minimap which nearly costed me the game because I couldn't see them behind the minimap. Either add a bit of transparency to it when crouched or give the option to control how transparent the minimap is in the options. I wouldn't mind completely moving the minimap either.

I have both a PC and PS4, I usually play different games on each and enjoy using MnK on PC and controller when playing on console.  It's extremely frustrating to play against MnK players on console.

I understand that it's a player choice and people who wish to use MnK in a game that allows it are free to do so, however it's not fair on those who wish to use the default controller and sit back, away from a desk and play.

It would be easier if it automatically was sucked into a player within a set radius.

""But then I'll have rpg ammo when my friend has the rpg""

Easy: When doing squad play the whole team shares an ammo &amp; resources cache. Weapons loaded with ammo do not count and each reload takes from the stockpile. 

The only way to get ammo is by eliminating a squad. All of the teams ammo &amp; resources will drop on the final players body. 

Pros: Easier ammo/ resource grabbing, sharing ammo means more ammo for all, team resources allows one player to build while others defend. 

Cons: only weapons drop from kills unless it is the final squad-mate. no drawbacks in solo play that I can see.

Thoughts? Comment below.

Edit: This could also allow for noobs to keep looting while the storms eye closes allowing them to sacrifice themselves to help supply their friends",FortNiteBR

So, i was playing last weekend and i got banned with no reason i'll attach a photo with the message i got that night, after that, i decided to sent an e-mail to their player support system, i got an answer telling me i was cheating so they had to ban me. This was amazing because obviously it was a mistake, after that i went here and i found so many people with the same issue as me, so i breath -ok,this isnt bad, im not the only one- i saw inmediately  response from EpicGames's staff here and i was impressed, its amazing the power of reddit and the community you can find here, anyways, since that i was refreshing different threads looking for news and maybe some solution for this, of course i got responses and stuff. Yesterday they announced ""Unbanning is complete. Sorry it took so long!"" -18 hours ago- i was very happy i was in the streets and very excited to arrive home and play some games but surprise surprise, my account was still banned. After that i left a messagge on the original thread -i'll link it later- and i saw a response but it disappeared, the message said "" i'll check it for you"", so i was waiting for a soon answer or something, checking reddit, gmail and also logging to the game with two accounts -i created another one because i was hoping i could play but i just realized my ip was banned- Anyways, i wrote all this to tell my situation to you guys, i hope im not the only with the issue, and if i am, it would be nice for an answer i know it was a mistake but since yesterday i feel ignored and i just want them to check the situation of my account, im being totally honest, im not a cheater, i'll never be one but again, an answer would be nice.

But I don't use it as much as many people think is ""necessary"" on this sub reddit.

And here's why.
I've played my fair share of H1Z1-kotk, in which I used to rush through the game and go after people I spotted. I kept playing like this after I switched to FortniteBR. I guess you can say it's an aggressive approach. 

Yesterday I won my very first solo game in Fortnitebr, with 10 kills. Now I thought that was quite a lot! Oh boy what a feeling... 
But I didn't build a single wall. once I was in the top 10, I kept sprinting and circling around the stormcircle. Once I spotted a ""safehouse"" I got the higher ground, without building stairs. Most of the times I spotted people peaking from the top of their safehouse. Just waited a moment with the bolt-action sniper and... BANG another kill. Then I continued walking around the outer lines of the playfield before people know were you are/where. I kept doing this until the last guy and I faced off in a shotgun battle. 

My point is, you can spot constructions from very far. As long as you stay focused on your position, and keep moving, you don't have to build your own little fort to be a sitting duck. This way I also kinda play around the many rockets flying around the map in late game. + You know where people didn't build their safespots.

tl/dr: I won a game without building, basically because everybody else was too busy playing worms from their own forts and I was sneaking past them, 1 at a time.

Started playing this genre when H1Z1:Kotk came out, then when PUBG came out I got that.

Just a little bit of history quickly, i live in South Africa- we don't have any local servers for games like this and the ones i mentioned above, only local servers we have are Dice Games, CSGO and Dota pretty much...okay lets continue.

In KOTK i got the FFTC Hoodie and a bunch of crazy items, been playing along time and i like to look nice :D I'm a Diamond/Master Rank player since P2,P3,P4,P5,P6 i think it is now, I say i think cause Ive finally stopped playing KOTK. Reason being the new update is absolute cancer and recoil is fucked. The learning curve is gone and GameBreak...uhmmm..sorry.. Daybreak have just gone to far and I will no longer support them or that game.

Now the PUBG part, pretty good at that game too but for me its abit to stale and slow, im sure some of you know what im talking about- its just too slow and movement is the worst ive seen in any game, it feels horrible.

RIGHT NOW FORTNITE!!!!
cool cool cool, if you've read this far thanks my dood, appreciate it :D
This game is absolutely amazing and i'm sad i never heard about it sooner. I started playing the day it became Free To Play, i wanted to see if i enjoyed the game before I hand over 39$ which in my currency is 13x that....work it out ;]
Right, so i played the game and fell in love with it!
The movement, ability to craft, the guns- everything feels fun and exciting!
I love the sounds of the game, chests opening- super rewarding, kills etc.
Basically I'd give this game a 8/10. 

Here's what needs to be fixed. A recoil pattern needs to be implemented or cone of fire decreased a little bit more, certain guns need buffing and some need nerfing, HACKERS NEED TO BE DEALT WITH- i cannot stress this enough. Ive won about 17 games since the FTP release, i've come about 20 times top 5 and died due to blatant obvious hackers- aimbot and or wallhacks.
ALSO VERY VERY IMPORTANT. A leader boards or stats page needs to be added ASAP as this will keep players grinding cause at the moment all our wins aren't counting for anything :(

Alright to conclude. I've finally found a game I can invest my time in again, im super happy with the team behind the game, they communicate with the players, they update often and i can see they are working with us to improve the game. Like i said earlier its not 100% perfect but im sure over the next couple months hackers will be dealt with and guns will be fixed. Please please don't f**k this game up EPIC, I often stream this game and want to really become good at it!

This is the only game I enjoy playing at the moment, please please don't mess it up!
Keep doing what you doing and this game should be a huge success!

I play this game for fun, but I feel that I would prefer for some stats to not be tracked, maybe I am the only one. 


Examples of things I would want tracked:
---
Kills

Wins

Wins this season

Objects built

Most Kills in a Game

Most health healed in a Game

Kills with/Favourite weapon

Longest life

Average life (based on past 100 games)

Average KDR (based on past 100 games)

Average position (based on past 100 games)



Examples of things I would NOT want tracked:
-----
Deaths

Accuracy

Average life (if based on all time)

Average KDR (if based on all time)

Average position (if based on all time)

Damage dealt to team mates

I feel in games like this, it is fun to track things like your longest life, favourite gun etc. 

However, if you start bringing things like KDR and accuracy into the equation, it makes you have to play in 'full competitive mode' all of the time, discouraging fun tactics such as rushing into combat at the start.

Another problem, which results in smurfing and creation of new accounts, some stats should be based on a reasonable history as opposed to all time. If you screw up your first 5 games, it shouldn't be counted towards your ranking/skill rating 500 games later.

A game that fell victim to too much stat tracking was CS:GO. At the end of a match, it was customary to shoot your gun in the air or knife fight your team mates. Once stats were introduced they started tracking your total damage (minus friendly fire) and accuracy. 

This meant everyone had to play super serious at all times, even when the match/round was already won and even discouraged viable tactics such as suppression spray, else you would be considered a noob when people looked your stats up. 

Even if you play well, the fact you sprayed 150 bullets from your machine gun for a couple of rounds 6 months ago, can still significantly impact your avg. accuracy.

I think positive stats should be tracked, but we shouldn't punish people long-term for messing around and having fun every now and then.

What are your thoughts?

**Defenders:** 50 players in the same team have 2 minutes to build their fortress (maybe to protect a treassure or something). Also they can pickup low tier loot around their zone.

**Attackers:** 50 players in the same team have 2 minutes to pick up weapons and loot items they find in their map zone. Also they can get resources to build, so they can access the fortress.

During the pre-match time, one team can't see the other.

This mode is an excuse to build cool structures. Right now in the battle royale mode you can't do much since the circle is always moving.

I myself come from a very competitive side of H1Z1: King of the Kill, and this game ( With a few minor fixes..) will become far more greater what that game has ever been or will ever be. 

I have put some really good hours in to Fortnite lately, and won a great couple of solos and duo squads. 

I would like to share my short list of things that I would really like to see in this game, nothing THAT major but a few things that I think will spice up the game a smidge. 

Here are four ""major"" things on my list; 

1 - Free look. With an hold of a button being able to look around without stirring up your movement and getting back stabbed in uncomfortable situations and being able to outsmart your opponent without losing mobility and be able to enhance you movement to a greater level is almost a must have in a ""BR"" game like this and many of its competitors. 

2 - Auto-run. It says itself it's just a great addition.

3 - Customizable crosshairs. Having a wide selection of different crosshairs or even creating your own crosshairs can define a player from another player, and create different play styles so players can feel more comfortable on the playing field.

4 - Helmet(s). Different rarities, or just a standard helmet that takes a shot or even multiple shots. 

I also have two bonus things that are just a big cherry on the cake.

Bonus 1 - Removal of bloom completely. This will create an even greater skill gap where skill wins over randomness which just says itself. 

Bonus 2 - Hoverboards. ( or other small vehicles) Speed and momentum can create a really fun and fast play style in this game. Nothing major or game breaking but just things that are there just so you can move from A to B much faster than walking without having an advantage over another player.

These four things and the two bonus things are just points out of my perspective that I would like to see in the game. Please let me know what you think and leave feedback on how I see on things.

Nonetheless this game is almost pitch perfect. It's actually insane.

Maybe a metropolitan complex like NYC but not as tall, maybe just blocks on blocks of 4/5 story buildings, with some Central Park greenery areas dotted around. Making a map like this would mean that the actual floor space of the new map could potentially be 1/3 of the original map, and would provide a whole different play experience.

Loot spawns on the train and players can get on the train and try to defend it from other people hopping on. Players can try to land on the train from the beginning and defend it as it goes around the map.

If you get hit by the train on the tracks then you die. 

If you are far from the safe zone and near train tracks then you make the decision to wait for the train or start running to the safe zone.

Thing is, I *hated* those games. Committing to building these massive structures was grindy as hell and took weeks. In Fortnite though, you can build up a fort in minutes. You and your buddies could pop in, wreck some cars, and have a decent little fort in no time at all. It'd be nice to be able to do this without worrying about the storm or being knocked out of the game.

Now, of course your fort would be gone when you log back in. It's super easy to bring down structures in Fortnite... But who cares? I'd love to drop in with a few friends, build up a base quickly, or assault someone else's and just blow off steam in a more ""open"" free roam mode without stressing too much about the storm or ""winning"".

After a bloody battle he is the only person left. He loots everyone and finds fifteen rockets between them, but nothing to shoot them with. On his way to the circle he is killed, and his killer picks up his ammo. The guy already has ten rockets, but also doesn't have anything to shoot them with, but he obviously takes them anyway.

The rocket stack keeps changing hands. Growing larger each time. When someone with a launcher finally finds it, its well over forty rockets high, letting him spam rockets to his hearts content.

The problem with these weapons is less the weapons themselves (barring some tweaks to rocket launcher reload speeds) and more their spam potential.

Here are a few ways I thought of to combat this problem:


* Less rocket ammo from ammo crates and more given with the drop of the weapon. 

* A cap on how much explosive ammo you can carry.

* More common explosive weapons with worse range/damage/reload speeds etc to let more people deplete rocket ammo in early/mid game fights.

Those are my suggestions. What do you think about the ammo situation, and do you have any suggestions of your own? Please comment below. ",FortNiteBR

Anyway, I came first for the first time! Woo! I've played maybe 20 matches. I never gave up when I lost a match. I jumped straight back into another and tried again and again. The best advice I can give anyone is to learn the game and improve your aim by diving into populated areas instead of diving into a farm house at the edge of the map. Don't be afraid to fight people. If you let someone live instead of engaging, they'll bite you in the ass later. 
E.g. You'll be fighting two enemies instead of one. 
Watch youtube videos of other people playing and adapt it into your play style. Learn which weapons you like and learn to use them correctly. Use all your weapons to your advantage. Never go for loot boxes.
Use your environment to your advantage. Always take high ground. 
If your on PC, increase your mouse sensitivity. You should be able to do a 360 turn with your character from the left side of your mouse pad to your right. 
Always use the rarest items if you can.

A friend talked me into giving this game a try. I have never played a BR game so I was coming in as green as green can be.
I think I did pretty good for my first foray into this genre, and had way more fun than expected. Some highlights:

My first game I died before I even found a gun. And yet I still got 70th place. I learned over the course of the weekend that this doesn't mean jack...but it still was an interesting ""good"" feeling to do nothing and not get dead last place my first game.

I continued, with varying success to jump into places with names, and get some kills. I was getting 25 - 50th most games (with the sporadic 80th place insta-death mixed in) and was feeling pretty good. Then I had my day 1 light bulb moment.

I landed at greasy grove and only 1 other person was there. We raced to a weapon, I won by a step, and soon I was all alone looting to my hearts content. Fully geared up I kept running to the circles and never saw another player until there were only 5 left. TOP 5. I was so pumped. I dashed into the middle of the circle with my full armor and weapon supply looking for these last 4 to do battle with and maybe get my first win. You know that eerie quiet in a horror movie right before something goes catastrophically wrong? Yea. There was a 3-5 second window where I was running and thinking ""why is no one else here? This seems odd."" 

As I disintegrated into a rainbow of supplies from the kind sniper who I'm sure was stunned at this fool prancing about in the open like a drunken bambi, I decided I should watch these final 4. And lo and behold...they were building structures during fights to get height and cover, etc. I had only used ramps to get places so this was kind of eye opening. I squirreled away this new info and went to bed. 

First game Sunday was my best. Landed in a populated area, won my fights, had loot, had building supplies (I now understood to get some lol) and was raring to go. Make it to top 5 again. I get into the last circle and my eyes light up. 2 of my opponents are having a gunfight in front of me and have no idea I'm there. Pop pop pop from my AR and now there are 3. As I'm picking up the loot I get hit from someone else who was watching and I quickly put up some walls And a ramp to see over them. I'm learning. 

While I'm trying to peek out and pick off this guy, I hear footsteps behind me. I 180 and unload right as his first bullet hits me. This dude probably thought I was cheating. I was insanely on target. I'm only an ok shot in any shooter so I legit surprised myself. Every bullet hit and this dude got melted. My best turn on someone of the weekend. 

Brimming with confidence I turn back to the final opponent from earlier and decide no more games. I'm a beast. I'm gonna hunt him down. I flip to my shotgun, jump over my walls and sneak around his hiding spot. I see him and let fly with my shotty.

To say I choked would be an incredible disservice to chokers everywhere. I miss three shells before he even fires back. His accuracy is also suspect and it takes him 4 shells to put me down. Which for you math wizards means I fired 7 shells in close quarters when I had the drop on him and couldn't secure the win. What a cluster. 

In any other game I've ever played that would have salted me out for a week. For some reason in this game I just thought ""wow....I'm really really bad"" and then got into my next game. I played for a long time after that placing anywhere from 3rd - 74th, and always having a good time. 

I still haven't won, but this game has me hooked. I can't wait to play more after work today. Even in losses I don't get salty which is interesting. Not sure what the formula is they've captured here, but for me, I like it. A lot. Great game design. Super fun. 10/10 would fail on final 1v1 again.",FortNiteBR

2)Similar to the button mapping suggestion, it is very frustrating building on console. I HATE circling trought my build options. and I wish my first option was the stairs, since they come most handy early game to reach chest, get better positioning and climb hills. Let us have an option with the button remapping to remap our build order as well. This would make the game less clunky. And let us delete builds that we dont want to use. I have NEVER EVER used the roof build, would love to just get rid of it and every time i miss my stairs click i have to deal with a dead option.

This game is super awesome, and I am loving every bit of it. I even got my girlfriend into playing it, and she managed to get first  once, no idea how, but she did, haha. Anyway, as a community, we have a big impact on what happens to the game, so by saying what the top 3 things you want to see done with the game, maybe the devs will get ideas, or even prioritize certain updates :)

I'll go first &lt;3

1 - Level up system / cosmetics. I believe the devs are working on both already, but I am still pumped to see this come to the game. I've had buddies say they don't care if they lose simply because it is nothing to be gained. It makes a lot of sense, but either way, game is still super fun, and I would love to see this added soon!

2 - As a console player, I would love to see the button layout improved. Once again, the devs are working on it, but none the less, I want this ASAP :D The community had a ton of great ideas, such as swapping guns with your directional pad. Hopefully the devs listens to the community to optimize the layout.

3 - Continue banning hackers. I play on Xbox so this is not an issue for me, but it would drive me nuts if I ran into it regularly. Just sharing some love to the PC players &lt;3

 - you have to be really lucky in the first seconds to at least find something to fight with - i like having 100 people on the map but its fells like the POI are really short on loot most of the time.

i know this RNG is part of games like this - but its too much in fortnite - its ok in solos most times but its crazy in squads / duos.

there is not enouth loot in one house so most of the time the first fight is not a fight at all. its pure luck on who grabs the only gun first -  And dont get me started on how sometimes ammo spaws without the gun so good luck fighting back. 

at least make sure all houses have a couple of pistols on top of the RNG loot so that its not certain death when you land second on a house ?

They also learn how to tweak game files to make their games playable. I was having an absolutely great time playing this game up until the update where this picture right here started occurring. Before I would play the game above 30fps at all times(which is playable to me) no problems at all having a GREAT time. I LOVE this game. that's why I'm making this post because I really want to play it again. Now whenever I load into a game its just, unplayable. The giant trees that you altered the textures on(and made much uglier, imo. The previous ones were vibrant and made the environment more lively, but im digressing.) These giant trees ruin my fps when I'm falling into an area. Even if there are no trees in the immediate area if they're close enough in render distance my fps will drop whenever I look in their direction. This makes playing the game pretty much pointless because in gunfights you need smooth crisp fps. Which I and others like me HAD before you did what you did. I believe it was removing dx10 support.

To preface (and I do mention a lot of this in my email to them, which is shown underneath their reply to me in the screenshot), my friend was recently randomly banned from the game. He was in a party with me and two other friends. None of us were cheating, and I was one of the first people dead in the game. After a large fire fight, my friend Arcus dropped a medkit for one of us who was injured and then just, disappeared from the game. He had randomly been banned for no apparent reason whatsoever. I told him it's fine and to just shoot them an email to clear this up, so he did. Mentioned how he had not been cheating and what had happened before the ban. A short bit later he gets [a reply](https://imgur.com/mrrt4nE). They don't even mention a reason for his ban. Since he was told that any further contact on the issue would be closed, I decided to step in.



A couple things I'd like to point out here. First of all, these replies from Epic were coming insanely quick. I usually expect a day from companies to reply to issues, but they got back to us in only around 30 minutes. Not damning by any means, but it's certainly something to think about. Seems a little quick to actually investigate why someone was banned. Also, I play on PS4. I've heard it's possible to hack on PS4, but I've never seen it and I certainly have no clue how to do it.

The huge thing here though is in Kat's response to me. You'll notice, I made it very clear I was talking about my friend being banned here, not me, because I wasn't banned obviously. However, Kat goes on to explain that *I've* been caught cheating to gain an advantage over other players and have been banned for it. This got me a little worried, because I then assumed that I had been falsely banned for contacting them. But I opened up the game and jumped into a party and sure enough I was able to play. I'm able to access my account on their website and everything. I am *not* banned, so why is Kat telling me that I've been cheating and have been banned for it then?

I then went to the official discord to see by any chance if I could actually speak with an employee (a longshot I know, but I'm covering my options). There I met another guy who was also falsely banned. He claimed there was a hacker inside the server, so they must've just did a mass ban. I can't verify whether he's telling the truth or not obviously, but it's worth mentioning that he received the exact same email as I did.

So here's what I gather from this. Epic did not read our emails. Epic did not investigate our cases. They simply read that our emails were about being banned (my email subject was ""random ban"") and fired off an auto response. They didn't look at our accounts to see if we actually did anything wrong, they just assumed their anti-cheat measure was correct, which is obviously bugged because I'm seeing a lot of posts here regarding false bans.

**Edit**: I should clarify that my friend was playing on PC, I was playing on PS4

**Edit 2**: Epic has made a statement saying that there have been false positives and that they're working to fix them. If anyone there is seeing this, I want to say thank you. This thread wasn't really about the bans themselves per se, but the fact that any sort of communication regarding the issue seemed to get instantly shut down without proper investigation. But you're taking the right steps now, and I can appreciate that.

**Edit 3**: To anyone saying he should just create a new account, it doesn't work. I don't know if it's an IP ban or hardware ban, but he did try to make a new account and he still couldn't play anymore.

**Edit 4**: We were playing in squad mode, we were not teaming up in solo queue. Also, I just want to say that I do understand this is a small team working on this game, and I can't possibly imagine how much work this all is, but think of this from our point of view for a second. We believe it's a false ban, and we see other people reporting false bans. We try to resolve the issue, but are immediately shut down and told not to contact them about the issue again. At this point, we have no way of knowing they are aware of false positives, so I decide to make it known and point out the shady customer service we received. It's like that bystander effect, sure we can just assume that others will report it and they'll figure it out while risking never playing the game again, or we can make our voices heard as well.

**Final Edit**: I deleted the last paragraph because Epic has taken the proper steps to fix this issue and that paragraph sounded a bit too angry, and I do apologize for that. I want to reinstate, my goal with this thread was to try and show that there was an unfair ban appeal process and that any attempts were just being hit with an instant autoreply. It **wasn't** a ""my friend was falsely banned so you all need to get angry with me and get him unbanned"" kind of thing. Epic has taken the proper steps to resolve this issue, and I'm very thankful to them, especially considering how quickly they ended up doing it with that small of a team! Please do note though that this thread came *before* their statement thread. At the time, there was no way to know that the false positives would ever get a case made for them.

On another note, my friend was confirmed to have been hit with a false positive and has been unbanned. So to everyone calling me or him a liar, there you go. It's pretty surprising seeing as I hacked that Pokemon game a year ago and made those two comments in r/3DSHacks, so obviously that means my friends and I use aimbot in every online game we play /s",FortNiteBR

**tl;dr**, Ok, many users are falling in this thread and don't know what is happening. Few hours ago, Epic Games released a new update and they probably implemented some ""anti-cheat"" (finally!), but the problem is: several players are being banned for no reason, including my brother. I know it looks like an ""excuse"", but its true and I sent a msg to support already, hope Epic can fix ASAP because there are many players reporting the same (and some players being banned LIVE on twitch).

There's threads there bragging about how blatant hacks aren't getting banned, and new hacks are being posted every day.

I know this subreddit is getting tired of hacker threads, so this is my last one. I'm done with this game. I can't spend my limited free time to have zero enjoyment. I know EPIC is ""working on it"" but how long are we supposed to wait. Weeks? Months? Like I said it's only going to get worse before it gets better. 

A couple days ago I was begging my friends to play with me, now I can't recommend this game to anyone. Shame, because EPIC is a great developer but they didn't predict this happening and now it's probably too late.

Now lets say for example you are shooting at a guy who has 150 Health (100 Health &amp; 50 Armor) and lets say you hit him in the head for 86. The 86 indicator will be Yellow on your screen. Now this is the issue. You are now under the assumption that this guy has 14 health left so for sake of argument, you rush him. Since the game doesn't show you that some of that was Armor you are actually going into a close range gunfight vs a guy that actually has 64 health instead of 14. This is a big difference depending on where you hit the person it will take most likely 2 shots when in your mind he is one shot.

I think an easy fix for this would be two indicators. So lets go back to the situation, now instead of showing 86 Damage in Yellow how about 50 Damage in Blue and also 36 in White/Yellow text. This will make the player get the correct amount of information they deserve so they can go about the engagement accordingly.

So i look up on the game when it was in CBT and really got hyped because i prefer this kinda art style over Pubg.Despite claims that its a clone or something i was never bothered with it since its has its own style and thing.Also to me thats what make games better when it has something to compete with example Cod/Battlefield,Dota/LoL,Gran Turismo/ Forza and many more.

Wanted to buy Fortnite right away just to play the BR mode but wasnt able to due to being tight on the budget.So i kinda just watch youtube videos and Twitch to get my fix,when i heard it was finally out and free i was assuming it was just for people who bought Fortnite base game but what a surprise when i found out it literally is free to play even for someone who doesnt own Fortnite base game.

First, thanks to Epic for this game, it's pretty addictive and so far the only Battle Royale game on PS4, so good job at securing the spot ahead of the competition.

Anyway, after playing for a couple of days I thought of a few tweaks that would enhance the gameplay in my opinion. Sorry if this was brought up before.

1) Add a weapon selection wheel, pressing triangle 4 times to get from weapon 1 to weapon 5 is very inconvenient.

2) So far the largest portion of my gameplay was running somewhere for a long time. So, add vehicles maybe? As vehicle physics could be difficult to implement, another solution would be adding a speed potion, that would increase the speed for a period of time, BUT prevent you from attacking, as having a gunfight with a super-fast enemy would be too frustrating.

3) I don't know what R1 is used for in the PvE mode, but assigning grenades to it in BR would be very handy.

4) The melee damage is currently too low, it's almost impossible to pickaxe somebody with full health and a ranged weapon. Increase that to 20 or even 25 hp per hit? Also adding different melee weapons could be fun.

5) Being able to zoom in on the map would be nice.

6) Add health regeneration up to a certain point, like 25 hp. If you barely overpower an enemy and are left with less than 10 hp with no health kits and bandages, you might as well just quit and not waste your time.

7) Not so much a gameplay suggestion, but still, currently there is just one sound of footsteps in this game, no matter the surface. Even running in the water sounds like ground, for a game in 2017 it's pretty lazy.",FortNiteBR

IMO, the worst part of just about any BR match is the first three or so minutes.  You land, pick up any crappy weapon you see, scurry around praying your squad mates don't get taken out, and prepare for a lengthy walk to the first circle. 

My question to you is this:  Is the early game the weakest part of any match?  If so, how could Epic remedy this problem?

Also, before any weird redditors bombard me with downvotes, I think FNBR is crazy good.  Epic had an opportunity to be making a game we're all still playing in three or four years.",FortNiteBR

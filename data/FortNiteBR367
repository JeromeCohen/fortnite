Shotgun damage should be placed into separate brackets depending on the approximate amount of pellets that hit as oppose to distributing the damage equally around the pellets. This change would match well with adjusting shotgun headshot damage to 2X. 

The outcome of this change will be that the skill gap of the shotgun will be increased, players who are accurate with most of their shots will get the highest damage bracket but those who only hit a few pellets won't be punished with ridiciulous damage numbers such as 7 or 9.

**Introduction:**

I haven't seen much posts like these around the subreddit, so I'm not sure whether it'll be something people are interested in, but I thought I'd create this anyway. A widespread discussion amongst the community for a very long time has been revolved around shotguns and their inconsistencies, lots of users remark upon the annoyance of shotguns sometimes doing 7 damage and at other times being able to kill someone in a single shot.

The main reason why these inconsistencies occur is because of the way the shotgun works from a design perspective. Each shotgun fires 10 pellets everytime you pull the trigger, each of these pellets account for 10% of the shotguns maximum damage output, this means that there are eleven different possibilities occurring when you fire at someone, ranging from a miss to the lowest damage output and the highest damage output. 

In this post, I will be explaining how the shotguns currently work in the game and why it causes so many inconsistencies, then I will provide data on my proposed solution and how it will affect the gameplay.

I will be using the uncommon pump shotgun as an example throughout this post.

**How the Pump Shotgun currently works:**

Pellets Hit |Damage| % increase
---|---|----
1|9|0
2|18|100
3|27|50
4|36|33.3
5|45|25
6|54|20
7|63|16.6
8|72|14.2
9|81|12.5
10|90|11.1

Lots of users will agree with this system, because it's essentially debated that the more accurate you are with your shots, the more damage your shotgun does, although due to circumstances such as latency, it's not always possible for a user to have their shots truly accounted for on every occasion. Many users have posted videos showing over the last few months showing this in place, where it seems that the shot was completely on target, but came back with the lowest possible damage output.

The solution which I feel would be best for this scenario is having damage brackets on shotguns. The way this works is simple, from a design perspective the shotguns would still fire 10 pellets although, instead of each pellet accounting for a distribution of the shotgun damage, the game calculates the number of pellets which hit and categories that into the preset bracket and outputs the stated damage. 

**My proposed Damage Bracket Solution:**

Pellets Hit|Damage|Processed Pellet Output|% increase
---|---|----|----
1 - 4|27|3|0
5 - 7|45|5|66.6
8 - 10|90|10|100

**Gameplay effects of my solution:**

Here's an illustration on how many shots it will take to kill a player with 200HP (this model assumes headshot damage is reduced to 2X for optimal balances in relation to the bracket changes). The illustration also assumes that either every pellet is a body shot or a headshot, obviously that won't always be the case in the game, and some pellets will be one or the other, but another bracket table could be created for that instance, this is just to prove the concept.

Damage Bracket|Body Shots to Kill|Head Shots to Kill
---|---|----
Bracket 1 (27 to body, 54 to head)|8|4
Bracket 2 (45 to body, 90 to head)|5|3
Bracket 3 (90 to body, 180 to head)|3|2

Now, some players will respond to this aruging that this change will significantly reduce the skill gap because it will remove higher shot requirements for shots that fell around the middle ranged of pellets, let me tell you why that won't be the case and actually the opposite is happening.

Let's look at how the current number of shots to kill is for the pump shotgun to the body:

Damage|Body Shots to Kill
---|---
9|12
18|6
27|4
36|3
45|3
54|2
63|2
72|2
81|2
90|2

As can be seen, once you consistently are able to hit 6 pellets, you achive the optimal minimum required shots to kill of 2 bullets. The way I have setup the damage bracket is that these shots which only hit about half of the pellets aren't treated the same as high pellet acquired shots, and therefore their damage is put into bracket 2. This means that the skill gap is increased because players will need to hit more pellets to reach bracket 3 which has the optimal shots to kill. Therefore, more shots on average will be in bracket 2, but players who are top-tier will still consistently achieve bracket 3.

As a result, the bracket system balances out inconsistencies. Players who fall short on pellets will be forgiven with a respectful but still significantly less damage output and in order to reach the highest damage output, players will need to perform even better than they are currently.

**Explanation**

So, why do I think that this proposed damage bracket solution will fix the inconsistencies of the shotgun, here are the three main significant reasons.

1: There are less possible damage outputs, but they are distributed to the extent of where the skill of aiming is still significant. Means the weapons are more consistent.

2: As humans, we don't count every pellet that comes out of the shotgun, nobody ever says ""I usually hit 5 pellets from my shotgun but wish I could hit 6."", this makes it so that we can assess our  shots on the basis of the range it falls into, as oppose to the directly on the number of pellets, an attribute of the weapon we cannot fully perceive. (hence all of the confused posts on shotgun damage.)

3: It gives us more control of shotgun damage. If we asked users to go out and play a challenge in where they only hit 6 pellets in every shotgun shot they fired, I doubt anyone would be able to do it during combat, although if a user was asked to try and only hit a specific damage bracket, it's a task which gives us more control, therefore players feel as if they are more responsible for their shots.


**Bracket Analysis**

**Bracket 1** - This is the minimum amount of damage your shotgun will do if you hit a pellet. The reason as to why this has been set at 27 is because it's a respectful output, the game rewards you for obtaining a hit with your shotgun and the damage is significant enough to hurt your opponent without making you feel that the shot might aswell have been missed (like when it did 7.) As demonstrated by the graph, the difference between the damage in this bracket and the next is at 66.6%, so although you are getting a decent damage output, the comparison of it to the next bracket is large.

**Bracket 2** - This sets the average amount of damage the shotgun does if the user has managed to accurately distribute a significant proportion of pellets onto the enemy, it's a stage of where you are getting a significantly higher output as oppose to someone who did a bad shot, but not as good as someone who hit all the pellets. 

**Bracket 3** - Provides the optimal kill-time as demonstrated by the tables above, rewards the highest level of players who hit a high proportion of their pellets.

**How this relates to how the game currently is.**

So, this system currently exists for most weapons as per the recent First Shot Accuracy changes in relation to the amount of damage the gun does depending on range. Instead of calculating specific damage based on the exact number of meters the users are from each-other, the game finds the distance and puts it into a damage bracket, all weapons inflicting damage upon that specified range do the same output.

**Conclusion**

This is just my suggestion on how shotguns should be altered to be more consistent in the game, I know this is a topic that a lot of people have strong opinions of and therefore I fully expect some detailed contrary responses. I put a lot of time into the post to make sure all my information was accurate and I was portraying the best image of the system which is in place in contrast to the system I am proposing.

They serve their purpose and give players another reason (as if we needed more lol) to play the game. Still, I can't shake the feeling that some items are cluttering the loot pool and could be vaulted in favor of something better. I'm pretty specific in stating that the loot pool for console could just some adjustments. Because items below are being used MORE on PC. 

* Boogie Bomb - it's fun .. sure, but is it really needed?
* Impulse Nade - talking about console here. I barely use it or see someone else use it.
* C4 - ""Great for bringing down bases"". Yeah, if you could toss it alot further!
* Silenced SMG - weapons that are hit by bloom the most. Terrible at ""long"" range, mediocre at medium range, outclassed by shotgun or TAC-SMG.
* Slurp Juice - could use a buff. No need in running around with these because of the existence of bandages, (mini) shields, Chug Jug.
* Crossbow - fires too slow, deals way too little damage. 
* Revolver - fires too slow, unforgiving when you miss. Always dropped in favor of something better.

With the Jet Pack, we could've had alot more engagements on a vertical level. I was looking forward to it ... and still am, to be honest. However, with the recent additions, I feel like the game isn't improving the battles ... When you are facing that last player/squad, they always carry the same stuff. 

* SCAR, Shotgun, RPG/Sniper, health/shield. 

And that's about it ... 

I'd love to see MORE variation in that part of the game. Some more variation in the weapons we have, or additions even. A legendary/epic Burst Rifle to ""spice"" things up when facing the last squad(s). A decoy grenade to ""distract"" the enemy team. A trophy-system to counter the enemy rocket-spamming your base? 

This is by no means a ""I hate your game EPIC"" post ... So I hope we can have a civilised discussion.

For those of you who have the Battle Pass, there was a challenge a few weeks ago that said

&gt;Eliminate Opponents in Tilted Towers 0/3

However, challenges carry over to the next week. They are more of ""seasonal"" challenges that are unlocked weekly, meaning I can complete a Week 4 challenge anytime between Week 4- End of Season.

There's no way they'll just eradicate an entire POI on April 18th. Either that, or the comet will crash after Season 3, because people are also talking about a new map, while plenty of challenges revolve around existing POIs, like eliminations in Shifty, Greasy, etc and plenty of Chest Openings.

The comet could probably bring a new POI, or maybe a zombie-infested mode all over the current map to promote Save the World. If not, maybe an entire new map without this one being chucked out. OR if something is gonna be destroyed, it will be a place that hasn't and won't be a part of any Weekly Challenges.

I don't think Tilted Towers will be destroyed in Season 3 at all.

**TL;DR** None of the POIs that are part of Weekly Challenges will be nuked/removed before Season 3 ends.

**EDIT:** Also remember that 1 tier is potentially 150 vbucks if Epic suddenly nukes Tilted. They won't make us spend anything just because of a surprise plan on their part to wipe out something that's part of the Weekly Challenges.",FortNiteBR

Back then, almost every post on the front page had an Epic flair. They didn't just comment on stupid memes and cool shots, they commented on suggestions and most importantly they actively communicated with us. Now it seems they're more concerned with releasing unbalanced content every week than listening to the community. As far as I've seen, they haven't replied to a single post about the guided missile. I feel as though they're trying to release new content in an attempt to distract us from all the bugs.. but the thing is that nobody is asking for new content. All we want is a stable game. Fortnite is honestly such an amazing game and I'd hate to see Epic run it into the ground like they did with Paragon. We need to stick together as a community to make Epic listen to us, as they have a reputation for not listening. I'm only saying this because I love the game so much.. but right now I don't think we're heading down a very good path.

EDIT: Another example of them not listening to us was during the Blitz LTM. The entire sub was filled with people talking about how much fun they were having and everyone loved the game type because of the increase in materials. So what did Epic do? They went against what the entire community was praising and lowered the amount of resources gained. Another thing I found fishy was the fact that they took roughly an hour to fix the V-bucks issue, yet they take weeks to fix game breaking bugs. Of course, the V-bucks issue may have been easier to resolve.. I'm not a video game developer but it's just a thought.",FortNiteBR

But I know enough and do enough to hold my own. I do call outs, I build, everything. I even give him tips. Lord please just let me vent. 

 Let me explain how this frustrates me on how he plays. He's not a new player. He's a slow looter.. But that's not the worst of it. When he gets shot at he WILL NOT BUILD. I tell him to and he's like ""nah, I got this"" Not even a wall to shield his ass.

 Nothing.

 Guided missle (anything explosive in that matter) incoming? Hopefully a rock will shield him. Launching a GM? Let's do this out in the open when the fucking Civil War is right next to him. 
Instantly downed.

 I'll warn him, and even build to shield us. But a lot of the time he needs to do it himself and won't. I'll be downed and I'm like ""TO YOUR RIGHT"", he looks left. He's not dyslexic. I'll be dead and he'll shoot at them close range with a fucking minigun... He won't jump when being shot at.. 

He blames all of his deaths and fails on his controller, that he can't jump... Or it won't shoot... The controller isn't even a year old yet, it's not broken. 

He blames his deaths and fails on lag... Or that the person was behind them when in reality they were in front of him. (This actually happened and I have it recorded, he's still in denial) 


Always hear the same thing from him when shit doesn't go well. ""Come onnnn, you stupid fucking piece of shit"" ""You stupid piece of shit' ""COME ON DUDEEEE"" ""Useless fairy"" 

All of our group of friends all see it and are like .... really? It gets boring playing with him sometimes because it's so predictable. 

I could make a drinking game of what he says or does in a night. I'd be shitfaced. 
I could even make a bingo card and play with our friends who play with us..

Nowadays, nearly every player who knocks me or my squad mates eliminate them instantly, without giving a chance to revive him, putting us down a player the rest of the match.  Even if its in the middle of a squad fight, even if the player is actually getting shot at or about to die, they ALWAYS instantly eliminate after getting a knock.

For me, this has got to be the most frustrating thing about this game.  This is especially frustrating when its not towards end-game, as if it's you getting eliminated, your forced to just spectate the rest of the match, or if it's your squadmate getting eliminated you have to play down the whole match.

In my opinion a freshly knocked player should be invincible for way longer than they are currently.  I'd say a delay to kill of around 5-8 seconds would help a lot.  It would make players who knock a player not just kill the player for loot, but move to try and find the other squad to kill them.  Also, it will help improve team play, as there is a huge incentive to rushing to a downed teammate to save him.  

In the games current state they might as well take out reviving because the only situation where me or my squadmates aren't immediately killed is when they are sniped or killed where a teammate is literally right next to them to build or kill the enemy.  And even then they still manage to eliminate. ",FortNiteBR

For example; Battlefield 4 was a mess for half a year. DICE would add in a feature or bug fix which either created new ones or broke the balances of other weapons or classes. Finally they announced the CTE servers which would be an ace to test new things that would be added to the game. This was genius on their part as it allowed them to fine tune additions to the game that would be coming. This has helped greatly with the games longevity, it’s even still played to this day with healthy numbers thanks in part to listening to player feedback. CTE was the best thing to happen to BF4.

One of the issues I see currently with Fortnite is the continuous release of new items and weapons without testing it in a live player environment to see how these additions will affect the flow or balance of the overall game. Imagine before Titled was added to the game, Epic did a community test server LTM to test out the new addition to the map to see how it changed the game and flow. A couple weeks of testing would reveal if there are some changes to be made to the game. I think it’s arguable that Titled changes up the mid game way too much, leading to half the server dying in the first few moments where’s is before the game had a much more evenly paced flow. 

Vending Machines would be another really good thing to test in a CTE. There has been a lot of resentment from players saying that it encourages for a more passive and camping play style, so why not test this ahead of time? Same with new weapons, guided missiles anyone? And for changes in the shooting mechanics, we already sort of have this with the shooting tests, why not expand on it? 

Just doing internal testing and then pushing out a new addition on the community without any real heads up is a recipe for some unbalanced and unintended gameplay. I think an ongoing CTE server would be a great addition to the game especially with the console side of the game. The game has serious lag issues for many console players, and being able to test if a new update will cause serious lag to one version of the game would be a huge plus for console gamers. Let’s say a new location adds some serious lag on the Xbox version of the game, it would be able to be caught ahead of time instead of just releasing it and then dealing with any consequences later. 

I think CTE servers would be a great addition to this game, I hope Epic has at least considered this. 


TL;DR: Epic should add a Community Test Environment Server for testing future weapons and game play changes before letting them go live.


Edit: To those saying that this is a beta and therefore we don't need one, I think despite this a CTE is still a good idea. Yes this is technically a beta, but you can still have a buffer server to test out things within your beta, some betas have done this in the past. Right now Epic keeps adding more and more additions without a community test which is leading to unwanted changes.",FortNiteBR

Bugs:

* Walking through stairs (Not sure if it works for walls or stairs): https://clips.twitch.tv/SolidObservantVelociraptorAliens

* Supply drops not falling after breaking a tree (don't have a video, I'll add one if I find one).

* Supply drops bugging out once you break a tree.

* Shotgun hit detection: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/89do6o/for_those_doubting_that_the_shotguns_are_bugged/
https://youtu.be/cb799uAsOW4

* Not being able to build (Not sure if this has been fix or not, but I've seen some videos of it. I will remove it if it has been.)

Epic you know we don't want anymore stuff added to the game till you fix all of the bugs. yet you still add stuff and don't listen to us? You're killing a great game. Just listen to us, please. Stop adding these useless things into the game, and take some time to fix all the issues in it. 

There was a post on here that say that Epic destroyed Paragon and they won't listen unless we all come together as a community and voice our opinions and concerns. He also recommended that we all make a post about it, so I did. I would link it, but I can't find it.

A good example of this is the bunny skin and its messed up ears or the recent in game lobby where the skin goes all over the place. Literally all Epic cares about is $$$ right now it seems.

If we all ban together and not purchase the in game items im sure they will start to actually fix the game instead of trying to shove new items down our throats. Plus we all know the items come back in store unless its a seasonal, Raptor came out in like December and goes through multiple rotations so any new skin they come out with you will be able to purchase once they actually fix their game.

Just my two cents, I love this game but hate the direction it is going.

I know that the whole meta these days ultimately ends up being close range shotgun fights. The higher you progress through the skill gap every fight pretty much ends in shotgun battles. In my opinion it's making the game stale and it makes me rage a lot becuase there's no point in using anything other than a pump or a tac in close fights. 

With good building you can close gaps relatively easy. Personally I consider myself a good player. I play tournaments and play almost everyday for hours and hours. In my experience the shotgun meta that's so apparent is getting annoying and frankly kind of toxic.

Up until the past month. This month, I have not had a single enjoyable experience with fortnite. There are way too many bugs that aren't being dealt with because the devs are just focused on shitting out broken content designed to make the game more about luck than about skill. (EG; guided missile / vending machines). When we still have issues with major lag that makes the game unplayable, incredibly inconsistent shotgun damage, building issues, the major problems console players are having, the list literally goes on and on. Devs need to focus more so on broken aspects that are ALREADY IN the game rather than adding more broken shit. 
I hate it because this game has gone from one that I would enjoy with my friends every time I played to one that I literally haven't played for over 30 minutes in a month. Maybe I wouldn't make such a big deal about the guided missile if the CORE aspects of the game weren't broken to shit, but they are. Shit needs fixing. Bad.",FortNiteBR

Taking fights from the left shoulder puts you at a severe disadvantage against someone peeking from their right. Don't understand why we don't have shoulder switching yet, as it's a basic feature in almost every third person shooter.

I know that this thread will seem pointless to many of you, given the in-game issues that plague the game ATM (especially console players), but this emote thing is just weird IMO. It also doesn't make sense business-wise; potential customers are discouraged from purchasing emotes.

I rarely survive gunfights because I can’t shoot for shit with opponents jumping around and I still can’t build anything to cover my lame ass quick enough. Most of the times I can’t even stay alive for two minutes after I land. My only victory royale is on 25-man squads. I’ve never been a good gamer but I’ve never been so bad on any other game.

You should at least have a bit more time to be able to survive.

I understand they don't want to make shotguns useless but then it would just come to using building to get close. They should increase the footstep distance enough so that shotguns won't be a one hit kill if you have full health but no shield so that there is at least a chance to survive against a decent player.

The devs have said that they want to keep triangle (again, PS4) as a quick switch to the pickaxe, so I think it makes sense that circle will always switch you to your weapons.

This is probably pretty minor, but it definitely comes into play when you get ambushed with your pickaxe out, panic build a fort, pop up to return fire and then realize you have your pickaxe out so you have to switch again.

So here I think it should be like, let’s say you get 5 kills the cost of materials would decrease, then 10 kills would make it decrease dramatically like the cost would be 250 materials then 15 kills would be the overall tier to making the vending machine “cheaper” .
15 kills could mean an RPG could cost 150 materials , maybe add little extra things like change the vending machine weapon choice , I think for extra benefits 20 kills would open up some “special”rewards like calling in the storm faster , controlling the game in that sense making the other players fear you and the other extra benefits would be calling in air drops or a Llama now.



for my other idea , sorry to anyone who’s ever came up with this idea , it’s something that I think every player would want so doubt I’m the only thinking of this.
Wins are what we go for but they don’t actually mean anything and I think it’s cool we have a leaderboards but isn’t something I care about , maybe if we had a system where winning meant something more , I Introduce you to credits or battle royale tokens  whatever the name people prefer anyway so let’s just talk about outfits and the costs , most outfits that look good are normally 2000 VBucks and that costs a lot over time spending that much will add up and it’s quite ridiculous that I’ve have spent over 150 probably 200 on battle royale so here’s the system that I think could help everyone and it would appeal to everyone and for people who don’t ever spend any money on outfits.




let’s say you win a game you earn 5 credits after reaching 30 wins you’d earn yourself 100 credits and outfits would cost around 500 to 750 credits , winning would mean a lot more , it also represent players skill and showing that they’re good and have knowledge of the game , they’d be Pacific outfits for winning in solo and then duos and squads would be together , some people would might get the idea that some players would get carried by their friends to getting the wins so having solo in there would help some people look good and showing their outfit off , seeing players with outfits that require 100 wins or a requirement of number of credits to get , it’s an Accomplishment to yourself, I apologise for the long paragraph but if you have come this far then thank you and let’s support fortnite as much as we can , we’re a community and helping and sharing our ideas can help epic games make fortnite even better.",FortNiteBR

So people who use double shots against me are no problem. If you were told to choose 1 swrd to fight people out of the three (lvl 10 or lvl 5 or lvl 5) what would you choose? Of course its the lvl 10 bcause its the strongest. Its pointless to make those 2 other swrds if the 3th will be stronger than the 2 other. That lvl 10 swrd is exactly the double shot and the other swrds are the other variations of shotguns in the game. It diminishes the other 2 guns and makethem pointless and useless.

There is nothing that you can do while a guided missile is roaming around but box yourself in, and if you don't box yourself in you're either dead or extremely vulnerable. This forces people to play far less aggressive and encourages a sort of camping.
You could argue that you can shoot down the missile or the player controlling the missile so it's therefore somewhat able to be defended against but these actions of defense are virtually impossible to do if other people are shooting at you and your walls, especially in squads where there are people to shoot at you and your walls while protecting the player controlling the missile. 
I think it should be modified to inflict less damage or something of that sort. It is just far too perfect to have in squads especially but also across all of the game modes.
Most of the people with whom I've talked about this agree that something needs to change about it.

Nothing happened between us, but this game has changed me for the better.","Hear me out, I'm not meme-ing. Posting this on both Fortnite subreddits to share my story.

There's this girl I liked for some time. She wanted a multiplayer game, and I didn't know of any others. I started looking for one just to interact with her more, etc (don't judge me). I was watching PTCGO on Twitch when I found Fortnite. I've always been a ""non-gamer"", never been into shooting and stuff despite being a guy.

Started BR, she lost interest quickly. However, I kept playing. I found more friends online, never looked back since. 

Talking with people from other countries, guys and girls, has largely improved my social anxiety. I was in the middle of all this, while working for a Youtuber's blog online (not gonna mention their name), when I used my first income from that blog to buy Save the World (got it for 20$, when it was on sale). I just wanted V-Bucks, to be able to afford the Battle Pass and get skins.

And that started a whole new thing.

1)I made 8500 Vbucks from Save the World in 35 days.

2)In the process, I equally fell in love with Save the World itself.

I'm super into both games now, and interacting with people more and being a part of both communities r/Fortnite and r/FortniteBR has largely helped me.

I've finally realized the fun in gaming, staying up late till night spamming Tilted Towers (BR city), and then jumping into Canny Valley (STW zone) to use my Ninja and Dragon Slash the shit out of husks.

The best part of this is that Fortnite feels like a family. Despite people complaining, Epic has done a great job with developing the game and creating an amazing, interactive community here. Even the content updates are amazing, I look forward to Thursdays and the following weekends. Having a total blast in here.

Thank you Epic, r/Fortnite and r/FortniteBR!

Hope both games last for a long time.

&gt; im just small twitch streamer, i started to stream because i got great place at leaderboard, to share what i usually do in-game

I researched (reddit, youtube, twitch) if someone already did this, **using door**, it doesnt exist before my post,

**if someone invented before me and shared, It would have spread out a long time ago 
(it spreads in 1 week after I post it)**

&gt; i watch fortnite highlights, many people watch too and knows that i love rocketride, if someone had created and share before my post, I certainly would have received and seen. but that not occured

I was always looking for learn how to self rocket and guide it, im main explosives and seeking be pro at it

i create the original idea at April 1st to self rocketride with steering using guided missile, that started to spread, and 98% of the new content using this new meta dont give me a single mention credits for this :/

its easy to replicate, but Reifel was needed to say what it takes to do this, create the idea, and i shared when i made it on April 1st https://redd.it/88ur3m

&gt; recently ShyperPK start to use it and dont mention my credits, its like he took my idea and claim it for himself, he pinned his clip on his twitter with no Reifel's credits there and anywhere

im glad that @likandoo mentioned my credits on this but he was the only one to do that

Please buddy, put Reifel's credits:

* on title clips, if you see someone doing that and want to clip it
* on description bellow, on video texts, commentaries, sharing to a friend...

I'm happy, proud, and glad to invent that for you guys, and Fortnite Community, 

its healthy recognize who invented mecanics, new meta, technics, styles... need creativity and work to do it for the first ever time

how to do it: place a wall, edit a door on it, climb on the edge of the door, launch guided missile and aiming for your foot (bottom up angle)

I participate in custom squad tournaments regularly since 3 months and also recently attended my first Fortnite LAN event in France (the GamersAssembly in Portiers). 

The **potential** for Fortnite as e-sports title is insane, since the playerbase is really big (50+ Million) and there is lots of hype about the game. So naturally people want to see the best players compete.
A big competitive scene secured the longevity of games like Counterstrike or League of Legends and leads to additional publicity for the game we love.


#SPECTATOR MODE

By far the most important thing will be the viewing experience. I know that Epic Games is already working on a [replaymode](https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/21/17147224/fortnite-battle-royale-replay-system-epic-games-unreal-engine-420) and hopefully a spectator mode is also included.
It will be important that the spectator mode is **easy to handle** so the observer doesn't miss the action during a game.
 
I think it would be very userfriendly to have a map overview where you can see all the different teams in own colors and you can just click on a player to jump into his POV. 

A **spectator HUD** that covers the important information and is easy to understand is also neccessary.


#POINT SYSTEM

Point Rewards for **Kills** are very important. Especially in solo games since you can easily get top 10 without even having to take a fight, whereas some players that land in contested areas have to spend time and ressources to stay alive. 
Each fight vs an equally strong enemy is a 50% chance to die, so those who come ahead must be heavily rewarded. The more players you have on a team the more strategic the gameplay will get. 
In squads you can't just sneak between enemys and hide with a fullsquad for top placements, 
also there are 4x the ammount of players per team that can score kills so mathematically you should get 1/4 points of what kills are worth in solos.

For viewers it would be best to have a simple point system that is easy to remember and understand. So with all the previous points mentioned I want to give you my suggestions for point system in Fortnite. 

**100 points** , should always be the reward for #1 place and then from there on you can scale down the other ranks  (for example 85 # 2 , 75 # 3 , 67 #4 , 60 #5 , 55 #6 etc...) 
It doesn't matter how you scale down the points and even if you do it different for each game mode, but having a number like 100 for the first place just makes the whole system easy to remember and overlook for viewers.


**Kill rewards** in Solos 10 , duos 6 , squads 3. Getting 10 kills in a Solo custom game is pretty much the highest I have seen and should defenitely be worth as many points as the victory. Depending on the lobbysize winning teams usually get 10-20 kills. These should weight less than Solo/Duo kills, since most of the time they are a byproduct of winning thanks to being in a good position and not due to aggressive gameplay.

To give you some recent examples: this is the point system from the [GamersAssembly](https://i.imgur.com/Fp0blI4.png) - also here on the top right you can see point system for an [online tournament](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaHoAy0WAAAq1gP.jpg:large)


#SCOREBOARDS

It would be really helpful to have a proper scoreboard at the end of a game that shows the placements and kills of all players/teams

- [Leaderboard](https://i.imgur.com/ZRSBFfM.png) **for Solos** 

- [Leaderboard](https://i.imgur.com/Fb1sk74.png) **for Squads** 

- For duos the same, just split in middle (I know my graphics suck, but hopefully it's enough to understand what I mean)

This would be easy to share for viewers, and also for players or tournament organizers to prove placments and points for kills


#LOBBYSIZE


100 player lobbys are horrible for competitive solo and squad games. Right now 80 is played mostly, but for my taste still too much, since the current map doesn't have enough landing locations for that ammount of players.

The current map offers ~16 good starting spots for teams if they split and doge each other at the start. (64 Players) 

At the Gamers Assembly we played with 12 teams per game, since the servers crashed with too many teams on them. For me as player this was good because forced early fights always have more rng.
However for spectators this a bit too boring, so I'd settle with the middle ground of 16-18 teams per game. This should offer a good flow of action where, you have some teamfights at the start and always something to watch.


#CUSTOM SERVER

First of all I hope we get custom servers for everyone soon, or at least give them to more people so that the competitive scene can grow. 
Right now you just enter a Key for custom games and then join, this has multiple problems:  People can leak keys and trolls or unwanted players join. Teams often miss the queue or their key isn't working. It's chaotic to organize.

So I'm hoping for a **lobby system** like in most other games, where just every team joins and when everyone is ready the host starts the game. [Similar to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ard9k/concept_for_a_fortnite_custom_games_menu/) which someone here recently suggested 

Being able to **toggle certain settings** would also be a good way of keeping the game balanced for competitive while not affecting the regular playerbase.




#BALANCE

As an ingame leader that loves the strategic aspect of this game I have to say that the RNG for the **first circle** is by far the biggest problem from a competitive point of view.
It would be a great oppotunity to add settings for the previously mentioned custom game lobby menu that change the circle. 

- option A: Show the first circle from the start of the game, so you can either risk going in the middle and fight more teams, or land safer on the outside but have a harder time getting in

- option B: always make the first circle more in the middle, so it's more predictable

imo option A should add more variety to the games and also give an interesting dynamic when it comes to decision making for landing spots, which rewards teams with flexible landings.


**Explosives** are simply overpowered. I think it would be even healthy for the game to put a limit of 12 rockets that you can carry (2x grenade launcher reload), but once again you could add these settings to the custom server menu so it doesnt affect the main game.

**Traps** are way too random, you can't always scout for them. The spikes from traps should be a tiny bit longer so you can actually see them if you pay enough attention without having to check 90° upwards everytime you enter a room or building.


#LAN EVENTS

Battle Royale games of course mean that you have way more people participating than in other games. But it would still be really nice to have  close to **1m desk space**. 

**Ghosting** is another problem, since you can easily locate the position of another team if you see their screen. Some Pubg events had nice [setups to prevent this](https://clips.twitch.tv/ApatheticImpartialSandwichANELE).

And of course **loud noise** is a no go. This was a big problem for me at the GA, since a big streamer called ""Gotaga"" played on a stage with loud speakers and an even [louder crowd](https://youtu.be/uXi9FZ3qjDg?t=4m13s), which were right next to all the other players. Communication is incredibly important in Fortnite, so it would be great if future tournament organizers keep this in mind.",FortNiteBR

As soon as it got to top 10-15 before, I'd start to feel the pressure and lacked the confidence to just make movements.

For example, if I was in a tower, with 10 left, and I saw a supply crate dropped nearby. Even if I had no shields, I'd feel too safe in the tower that I'd be scared to make a move for the supply crate. The difference now is I do go for the supply crate, and get that shield and whatever else. I just am more decision in my actions.

(Mini essay),"I know what you’re thinking before you even type it below. “Git gud” “You obviously don’t know how to play against shotties” “Blah blah you suck learn to build” or something among those lines. And while those are all super valid and well thought out responses I wanted to make a post highlighting why I think the pump genuinely needs to be eliminated. Let’s begin. 

Let’s start with what I think is the most compelling piece of evidence. 

Skill cap. Skill cap refers to how much skill a weapon requires to be effective with. If you’re looking for the gun with the *highest* skill cap the bolt action sniper fits this bill. It’s incredibly difficult to use, with users needing to track their target, account for bullet drop, and they’re up against opponents who move much more often than similar games. The movement style emphasizes on jumping and quick movement so naturally a weapon where you need to be precise at long distances is going to be difficult. 

The payout here is the bolt has very high damage potential, with headshots being instant kills from every rarity and doing a large amount of body damage. And that’s how it should be. Something that is difficult to use should reward players for skill right? 

This is **not** how the pump shotgun functions. The pump is the only close quarters weapon with a one hit kill headshot crit damage potential regardless of shield. With that hell of a hit doing 200+ damage consistently. 

The difference between the pump and the bolt is that the pump is not difficult to use. Yet it rewards players the same as the bolt does with one shot kills being easily obtainable even with newer players. In a game that emphasizes CQC, this is absurd. 

Except that’s only when the pump functions as it should. Which it doesn’t most the time. 

I mentioned the pump is the only CQC weapon that can do this consistently, and it is. But the pump also suffers from being inconsistent a majority of the time as well. Frequently, with players who are at point blank range who *should* be doing that 200+ headshot crit are instead hitting for 95 or around there. Other times, even on close quarters body shots, the pump will hit for inconsistent numbers. Anywhere from 9 to 90. This is mostly a result of bloom and the ridiculous shotgun spread but still. 

The other thing I wanted to look at was the other two shotguns in the game and how they function. The tac shotgun has a shorter range than the pump, a bigger spread, and does less damage. It’s benefit however, is firerate. If you have a tac and can land all your shots, you can put out a consistent 40-70 damage a hit. This still does not rival the one hit kill potential of the pump. Yet the tac is much more balanced from a gameplay standpoint. 

Same can be said of the heavy shotgun. With a tad bit slower fire rate, it hits players for 70 damage consistently. And that’s the key point, it’s consistent. And look at its rarity, Epic has decided that arguably the most balanced shotgun in the entire game should also be the rarest.

Now before I go I should mention that some heavy balance changes could keep the pump in a healthy state. Particularly that in its damage. If you want to make it the highest damage in the game, it should be balanced by having a shorter range and a larger spread. And having a headshot crit do **max** 150-175. Changing the rarity AND the spawn rate would also help balance this gun, as I think it should either be blue or purple or purple and gold with the heavy being blue purple and gold. 

One last thing. *The best meta* this game has EVER seen, was just two pump shotguns. That’s it. And the current meta still revolves around this thing, with it being pump-tac/tac smh or pump heavy.

to get this started, I want to share my stats, not to brag about them but more to show that I am not a casual player and that my skill is at least above average.

I have a win percentage of 30% with a 5 K/D ratio and a Fortnitetracker rating of 4,950+ in over 1.000 games on console and pc. I play since day one and therefore have seen every state the shotguns have been in since release.

The reason why I'm writing this is the current state of the shotgun, especially the pump. Not only is it completely random but it is also the strongest weapon in the game and at this point, the whole game of Fortnite is defined by shotguns. Every battle that you engage ends up in a shotgun battle, every weapon loadout ends up with a shotgun, the majority of the playerbase used to double pump and now uses pump+tac as an alternative. And I can't even blame them, since you have to win a ton of shotgun fights for a win.

The biggest problem is and has ever been (looking back to why people double pumped) the one hit potential of the pump but also of the other shotguns. Each and every player from 150-200 hp can be one shot by the tac and heavy (150-180hp) or by the pump (180-200hp). 

And you can't ""just build lol"" to avoid this. You can't disengage and try to range fight someone. In the current state of the game 90% of the playerbase will just rush over 150m just to end up in a shotgun fight. The players WANT to get the shotgun fight, they NEED to get the shotgun fight, because in a long range fight you have to use aim, skill and timing to win.

It's sad how often me and my duo's mate hit a duo down to like 30hp each and ended up getting one hit with 200hp each. It's sad how often I knew I was dead because the enemy had a shotgun and I didn't. It's sad how often I knew I was gonna win, because I had a shotgun and my enemy didn't.

WAY too many fights in this game are just defined by shotguns and pumpguns and the meta game is completely evolving to shotgun oriented, because that weapon can erase anyone while jumping and turning with full accuracy and 250% headshot multiplier (the only weapon in the game btw, except snipers).

It should not be possible that a player who got outplayed a whole fight and is down to be one shot, can still handle three shotgun hits because of its pure randomness and then turns around to give you a jumping 180° headshot and delete your whole account from the Epic database by just one click on his left mouse button.


In conclusion something needs to be done ASAP to balance the way the game is beeing played - in a way that allows you to use a loadout without shotguns and to win a game with medium to long range fights and not only because you had the lucky hand on your 15 shotgun fights - and the way shotguns behave.

I have some suggestions, which could work:

- Take away some of the base damage of shotguns. If you halve their damage, they are still one of the strongest weapon class in Fortnite with a headshot multiplier of 2.5.

- Take away the possibility to headshot. In the current state, where pump + tac or pump + smp are a thing, shotguns would still work if you just couldn't headshot with them. A body hit of 95 is still incredibly strong and can give you the upper hand easily, so you can finish off your opponent with two tac hits or a few smp hits.

- Lower the headshot multiplier to 1.5 but nerf pump + [anything] so you can still one shot players with up to 143 health, but need a second shot for 144+ health. The shooting test #1 with a headshot multiplier of 1.5 on shotguns (in the first week) was one of the best times I've had in a long time playing Fortnite.

There surely are many more ways to balance shotguns and I am no game designer, but I'm a concerned and dedicated player who wants the game to be balanced and skill based. 
I hope anyone at Epic sees and reads this.


Thanks for reading and I'm open for opinions, since I know that many players will not be my opinion.

Shotguns, in my opinion, should be nerfed just to the point where they don't insta-kill on headshot. I think they should still have fairly high damage like they do now, but maybe a mechanic where if you're full health (100 shields, 100 HP) then it should just only leave you with 1 HP. Only if you're full health, though! It makes no sense outside of snipers and rockets to me! At least with a sniper I know that effort went into the shot. 

I think this would give players a fighting change because nothing beats a blue pump, not even the heavy shotguns. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten top 2 with full everything and I still get oneshotted by a shotgun. 

While the netcode and hit registration are a completely different issue for shotguns, I think Epic Games should apply a fix like this. 

What do you guys think? Is there any way that we can get something along the lines of this? Shotguns are too strong in my opinion and they've got the game's balls held tight in the meta.


Edit: GenFooFoo, down below, had a better idea than mine.

Instead of 1HP, this would give you around the same amount of chance to win the fight and it still puts shotguns in a strong position. ",FortNiteBR

Right now, an average of 22 people drop Tilted.  Let's guess and say 4 out of those 22 people, on average, get killed without picking up a weapon.

Now, if Epic were to turn down the loot rate there, say 20 percent, that gunless death rate might jump up to 7 out of 22 people dying without a gun.

If 7 out of 22 people who jump Tilted, aren't finding a weapon before dying, very quickly less people are going to be inclined to drop Tilted.

Maybe only 18 people on average drop Tilted after that.

Long story short...If Epic takes out a big enough percentage of the loot from Tilted, fewer people are going to drop there.

Especially the Morse code and the numbers 418. I've heard of lots of people thinking about it meaning April 2018 as in April 1st. We obviously know at this point that nothing really happened. There's also a theory about the meteor shower that goes on from the 16th to the 22nd (or something close to those dates) and that it's going to land on the 18th. But the issue people have with that is that it's just randomly in the season so it doesn't make sense.

So here's my thought (I'm not sure if anyone has point this out or not yet. I haven't seen anything yet):

Today is April 8, 2018. There are 22 days left in season 3. Which means the season will end on April 30, 2018. The last day of April.  End of April. End of season. End of Tilted Towers. 

This is of course just me speculating. Personally I'd be fine with the removal of Tilted and I love the community conspiracy stuff. So feel free to let me know what you guys think of the idea. Have a great day!",FortNiteBR

It isn’t me whining about how it’s OP and I keep getting killed by it. I know how to build, I know how to counter it. With that being said, this addition has absolutely destroyed the flow of the game, and there are numerous situations where this gun is ridiculously unstoppable and/or totally disrupts the flow of the game and ruins fights. Let’s get into some of these situations:

1.) Trying to have a fight (whether it be 1v1, 2v2, etc)  while some guy 150 meters away is firing missiles at both you and your enemy the whole time, causing you to intermittently have to just box yourselves in and pause your fight. On top of this, in the heat of your own battle and gunfire, it can be easy to miss that there is a guided missile heading right for you, either killing you or majorly damaging you and forcing you to heal or be killed by your current opponent.

2.) Going against a duo/squad that has an extra man (i.e. 3v4, 1v3. etc). The player with the guided missile can sit back in his cozy little 1x1 and fire rockets at you while his teammates push you. So there’s 2 counters to the guided missile right? Either build, or shoot it down. Well, if you’re build, you’re allowing his teammates to push up and take high ground over you while guided missiles are continually spammed at you. If you try to shoot it down, you are most likely exposing yourself to the advancing enemies and will likely be shot/killed.

3.) Trying to get into zone when you are being fired at with guided missiles by a guy inside zone. Let’s go over the two options to counter it again. Build? Well not really an option since the life span of the missile is 15 seconds and they can just circle the rocket around you until it’s life span runs out, all the while you’re taking zone damage, not an option. You can  try and shoot it down, but once again this will slow you down and a couple misses can result in you taking a rocket to the face. Also, if you are already out of zone, it will be extremely difficult to accurately shoot the rocket until it also flies into the blue.

Overall, I think the guided missile is a weapon that can be countered in some situations, but in the hands of players who know what they’re doing, can be pretty close to unstoppable. It ruins the flow of the game and results in deaths that you never even had a chance to fight back. To be honest, I don’t want it balanced or changed,  I just want it out of the game. The literal only way it wouldn’t deter me from continuing to play this game is if they made it so like 10 damage to players and made the primary purpose of it to rocket ride. You don’t have to agree with me, but this is just my two cents on the matter. With that being said, what are your guys’ opinions? Would you rather see it balanced, or just gone altogether? Or left the way it is, I guess?",FortNiteBR

5,hayasakasthighs,1557103566,bl5dm6,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bl5dm6/given_the_choices_we_had_the_drum_gun_was/,1,"Given the choices we had, the drum gun was probably the best choice","Now before I explain lemme say first that I am NOT saying the drum gun is a balanced gun by any means. The reason I wanted it is because it is OP in my hands and it has the largest mag size. It‚Äôs just a fun gun to use in general with a nice sound to it.

It was obvious the drum would be chosen when it was first leaked but I really don‚Äôt think epic rigged it. 

To explain why first let‚Äôs assume epic 100% rigged it. So why? Simply to put the drum gun back in the game? They could do that anyway with a new patch. So maybe epic wanted a diversion using the event as a way to make everyone accept that the drum gun is back because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù voted for it and epic had purposely made the event fail for other servers. Well that failed because people are still angry at epic and don‚Äôt want to accept the drum gun. The last possible scenario I can think of is epic just wanted to make a cool event to persuade new players to join knowing that the drum gun is going to return anyways. This is disproven because again the event didn‚Äôt work for everybody. Lastly, epic compensated people who waited for the event to not work with a 1200 vbuck glider/refunds to those who already bought it. Epic didn‚Äôt rig the event, in fact they took an L and had to damage control. They had a net loss 

Now let me explain why the other unvault options were never likely to win.
1) the planes were hated by bots, average players, and pro players alike. This was the one thing everyone could agree was ruining the game for them
2) the sword isn‚Äôt as bad as planes and was actually fun to use. It was easy to counter just by using balloons but the problem is that there is no point to unvaulting it. It was a weapon that could only be used by 1 person in 1 lobby every game. 
3) The grappler is something that could be used really well for taking high ground or running away. It‚Äôs a fun item that could be used by everyone but having only 10 charges doesn‚Äôt seem appealing at all. When we have ballers as a  fortnite norm, what‚Äôs the point?
4) The tac smg is a blast of nostalgia for older fortnite players and would be fun to use and hear again however the tac smg is simply just a p90 2.0 We already have the silenced smg, the p90 and a minigun/turrets to break down builds and laser people with. If drum gun wasn‚Äôt an option then tac smg for sure would‚Äôve been unvaulted. 
5) Bouncers are a very helpful tool for taking high ground are just simply rotating, but we already have so many rotation options. The problem with bouncers is that we would have 5 traps to rotate through(4 assuming most people drop turrets). Even rotating through 3 traps gets annoying at times. Not to mention a lot of newer players don‚Äôt even know how to place traps down or it takes them forever to do so. However if we had a pick 2 option I would‚Äôve definitely chosen bouncers. (Not that I was even there for the event anyways)

The drum gun however is fun because it‚Äôs OP. This gun is essentially the same as having an Ar combined with an smg with 50 shots per magazine. It‚Äôs incredibly fun to use and I‚Äôm prepared to get destroyed by them in early game by other people who get lucky. If any one of you voted for the drum gun and are now complaining that you‚Äôre losing when it‚Äôs not in your hands then that‚Äôs tough luck. You reap what you sow. 

Finally, all of this being said epic may not have rigged the event but they definitely influenced the drum gun being chosen either intentionally are unintentionally. Epic put dumbass options like grapplers or planes which would definitely not get chosen instead of something more viable such as shockwaves or heavy shotguns which would‚Äôve actually been able to compete against the drum gun. ESPECIALLY the heavy shotgun. If that was in there I‚Äôm pretty sure it would‚Äôve won no doubt. 

TLDR; like I said in the beginning given the choices we had, the drum gun is probably the best choice. Epic didn‚Äôt give enough appealing options to even consider. I would‚Äôve thought about shockwaves, heavy shotgun, or even the shockwaves",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôll also like to include that (at least my lobby) when the vault opened and players were allowed to go in, everyone was exploring and I was the first to try hitting the pillar of the drum gun. This caused the rest of the lobby to realize that the pillar I was hitting was the one belonging to the drum gun and they all bombarded it. I don‚Äôt feel like everyone knew exactly what they were doing and just wanted to see something go down. Also when the drum gun pillar began to crack everyone stopped voting for their preferred option and just rushed the drum gun one. Again, they just wanted to see what would happen.

Compare that amount of weapons to light ammo types, you have the suppressed, compact, and minigun. (Epic I will forgive you for your sins if you add a burst smg like the daemon.)

The issue with the medium ammo weapon types is that many of them serve the same purpose. Aks and infantry are for tap firing, the scoped revolver and thermal are extremely similar, the normal ar and scoped are used for spraying at range, and drum gun is anything you want.

I believe the scoped revolver and suppressed ar should be vaulted. The scoped revolver is between a sniper and scoped ar, dealing more damage and having a slower fire rate. But at the end of the day no one will pick it up because it has less dps than a scoped ar and doesn‚Äôt deal enough to pick it over a sniper.

To what degree, we don‚Äôt know.  Yes, the average skill level has increased **dramatically** but thousands of new players are starting this game every day.  Yet, we never see them in our games.   Nearly every player you run into is a capable player.  Shouldn‚Äôt be possible.  Here are some reasons you know SBMM is in the game.

1. Foreign players in your lobbies no matter what server you‚Äôre in.  
-We‚Äôve all queued up into matches and there‚Äôs always Spanish speaking players in our lobbies.  How are these players accessing NA-East lobbies for example?  SBMM.

2. Free game, yet everyone has a skin.
-Fortnite no longer has defaults running around in-game.  Yes, there‚Äôs pressure to buy skins but you‚Äôre telling me 99% of players in solo matches purchased skins?

3. Arena Mode already proves it‚Äôs possible.
-Arena mode already shows that Epic is capable of sorting players by skill level.  The same is done in public matches as well.

4.  New created accounts = easier experience
-Many streamers and players alike have done experiments where they create new accounts and the players are completely different.  No building, terrible gunplay, etc.

Now, let‚Äôs move onto WHY Epic has kept this a secret.  The reason is public perception.  Epic NEEDS new players to start up Fortnite and have an enjoyable experience.  If these new players joined and it was truly a random matchmaking experience they‚Äôd never stand a chance.

In terms of what we had to choose from, I‚Äôll give you a description of each one and you‚Äôll know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.

One give you an Insane amount of health and shield and destroys everything it touches

One gives you the ability to regain highground very quickly

One helps you regain highground slower, but can also send others flying if done correctly

One allows you to carry a full squad, almost as high as you want, destroys builds, and has guns on it.

One sprays 35 bullets in .73 seconds (humor)

And the last is a high round, low damage, build breaking bullet sneaking noob loving piece of trash

You get my point. No matter what was chosen, no one would be happy. I feel that this is more of a message from epic games the more I think about it.

Epic games removes Syphon settings -&gt; players are unhappy, saying you can‚Äôt protect noobs -&gt; after spamming r√®v√®rt for weeks, players feel epic doesn‚Äôt listen to the community -&gt; epic games added an event that allows people to vote, giving them a voice -&gt; players are given a choice of 6 vaulted items (vaulted for a good reason) = epic games stepping in to vault the dr√ºm g√ºn, and stating that THEY know what is best for the game, not the community.

Thank goodness Mordhau just came out or I might actually care.

Thanks, I guess?

I'm no sweat, mind you. I'm lucky if I keep a 1.0 K/D average and I usually spend like 10 minutes farming just to die in either my first or second fight. If I survive those, it's heart-rate-pounding time for another 10 minutes while I try to survive.

I loved Tilted because it was the fy\_iceworld of fortnite. If you're not familiar with the classic community counterstrike map, fy\_iceworld is basically two spawn points with three SHORT lanes and literally nothing else. All of the weapons are on the ground so as soon as the round starts, you grab a weapon and get to shooting.

So on top of all of the above waiting to farm and waiting to find enemies, I still have to go back to the minute-long wait to requeue, the minute-long wait to fill the lobby, the minute-long wait to drop from the bus, the minute-long wait to LAND.... it's just ridiculous.

The least you could have done was save this for the day you have an ""insta-requeue"" button, but no... PS Mordhau somehow has that feature in their BR mode...

So, yeah.

What did you think you were doing to the people who love Tilted? Do you just not care?

I hope to see the rebuilt tilted back and same as ever with updated graphics well within the month. I just can't imagine how the biggest game in the world thinks that destroying their most popular landing spot is a good idea.

Woooo ""the meteor finally hit"" what an Epic (TM) day.

This really makes me scratch my head, because when it was vaulted in the v5.4 content update, everyone knew it was because it was too overpowering against the individual and his building. 

Now, I know it was brought back due to popular vote, and that‚Äôs all on us, the community. But Epic didn‚Äôt do their part, which was actually balancing the damn thing. I mean, why bring back something that previously was vaulted due to being overpowered, just to bring it back in the same form without making even the most minor of changes.

Anyway, to the point, here‚Äôs my idea on how it could change.


*Current rarity*: Green/Blue
*Concept rarity*: Blue/Purple

*Current base damage (in order of green to blue)*: 26/27
*Concept base damage*: 25/26

Changed drum gun could have a bit bit more bloom, a little more recoil and a mag size of 45

Here's the thing kids, if this event proves anything is that the people who are really good at this game are the minority here, hence why the drum gun was chosen. The people that play this for a living or spend multiple hours in creative mastering build battles are the minority. Out of the millions of players who play this game, the casual player who just logs in 1 maybe 2 hours a day outnumber the ""sweats"" by a significant margin, hence why Epic will never cater to you. It would be bad business for Epic to bring back siphon because it would cater to the 1 percent and would drive the 99 percent away, their data showed that and they're not just making this up.

Those items weren't vaulted because epic thought just to do it randomly. They were affecting the meta too much and made the game repetitive and so were removed. But to bring them back like this makes no sense. At this point, Epic cares little about the gameplay of the game, if they bring stuff back that they vaulted due to balances.

For example, the drum gun wasn't vaulted for no reason. It was vaulted as when it came out, everybody had them, and the last few fights were just those. Another example, Planes. They were an option to be brought back, but the reason they were removed was due to complaining and how it makes other aspects of the game obsolete. Now if those were brought back, the complaining would start again, and many would say it would ruin the game again. There was less BS with the drum gun compared to the plane, however, but I'd expect players will get sick of it soon.

IMO, the volcano event itself was good enough by itself, and it didn't need ""The Unvaulting"".",FortNiteBR

2. They always change things before a big event, even if it‚Äôs the most healthy thing in the game and everybody enjoys it?

3. WHY. The unvaulted event was the worst event so far because the majority of players are young children who will just go with the crowd and it is now easy for them to play because of this drum gun

4. Just fix the game and make a balanced meta, one that requires aiming and building in one, nerf building damage on SMG‚Äôs and bring back siphon and the game is now balanced. That‚Äôs how simple it is",FortNiteBR

However, I think there is some changes that can be done to it to balance it more. As is, IMO the blue suppressed SMG is the better weapon over the compact SMG (P90). Its more accurate and has higher DPS. Also, IMO the drum gun is better than the blue smg and P90, as it does way more damage and has a 50 round magazine.

The drum gun is too powerful for a green/blue weapon, and I really think the first balancing adjustment it should get is to move it up to epic/legendary. This would essentially replace the P90, which should just be vaulted or made grey/green/blue because its worse anyway.

Also, another adjustment could be to decrease the magazine size, or add an overheating mechanic similar to how the minigun works. This would prevent people from sitting and spraying builds with it, which I think is the main problem with this gun. When someone is spraying your wall with the drum gun, there are very few counters, and I think it needs to be balanced.",FortNiteBR

The weapon: the LMG.

The LMG has first shot accuracy and a 100 clip magazine. With a gun like that, you would think it is insanely OP, but the gun had horrendous bloom and wasn‚Äôt that strong on structures/the environment. If there was ever any complaint about the LMG, it was that the magazine was way too high. 

By making the Drum Gun exactly the same as the LMG but with a 50 clip magazine, it will be perfectly balanced. Increased reloading time, decreased damage, decreased accuracy, weaker damage to builds/environments and same fire rate. Keeping the first shot accuracy removed from the Drum Gun will also help to ensure the weapon stays balanced. 

If these changes are made, the weapon will also be more comparable/balanced with the other SMGs in the game, except with a longer firing range.",FortNiteBR

This is the main reason why they took siphon away from public matches. With an MMR system, this problem could be solved.

   A hidden MMR system works similarly to a ranked system, but is hidden and applies to all types of matches. Let me explain.

   The better you play, the more your MMR increases. MMR is a hidden rating, unique to all players. Players with similar MMR are matched against each other. In League of Legends, for example, both the ranked and unranked modes use MMR, but ranked puts limitations on it. I.E silver players cannot play against diamond tier players. In unranked games (commonly known as normal games), this limitation does not apply.
 
   So how can this be applied to Fortnite and why is it useful? Well, let me name a few reasons;

   - The MMR rating would probably be determined with the pop-up style system, taking into account placement and eliminations.

   - After enough time with the system, good players will only be placed against other good players, which means bad players can start having fun again.

   - Since it does not take your rank into account, a division 1 player with god tier pub stomping skills would only play with other good players.

   - If this system proves to be healthy for the game, siphon settings could be added again, as the community as a whole enjoyed playing with them.

   The only downside I see with this system is that it would increase queue times across the board, but if after implementation the queue times are not that bad, it could be a good fix to our problem.",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm not throwing my toys out of the pram because my beloved grappler didn‚Äôt win, but I am so angered about the drum gun being back. I have played a decent number of games today and have came to the same conclusion I did when the tommy was last in the game, which was- the gun is absolutely ridiculous. 50 mag size, insane DPS, can be used as an smg, for breaking builds, as a close to mid AR and worst of all, drops as a COMMON and RARE item, the same rarities as a green pistol or an impulse grenade (not that these are bad items, but compare the Tommy‚Äôs to them items). They should drop in epic and legendary, with the damage slightly reduced if you wish to keep the large mag size. The rate of fire should possibly be altered also. The gun takes absolute zero talent to use and makes the game extremely annoying. If you‚Äôre in a one by one and getting sprayed by the gun either side, you‚Äôll know what I mean. Please, for the sake of the game, just nerf it big time or get rid of it. It‚Äôs way too powerful and hurts the game majorly. I‚Äôm not complaining or moaning, but I really do think the gun just isn‚Äôt made for the game, it‚Äôs way too good and requires no skill to use. It‚Äôs too versatile and powerful to be common and rare also, I‚Äôm sure many people can agree with me here.",FortNiteBR

Epic‚Äôs response to that is to give everyone who loaded in a **free glider** and **refund** people who already spent vbucks on it. 

My thing is, Epic, why?

What about those who spent vbucks and missed the LTM altogether? They didn‚Äôt specify whether or not they‚Äôd still get refunded so I assume they do. Epic saw monetary value in the event and as such see people *missing it* as their problem to correct. It only makes sense to give the glider to everyone at this point, **just make it a challenge reward for viewing the event replay** (or whatever their solution to that is).

Giving everyone* the glider and not **everyone** will only result in more whining and complaints, contributing to the ‚Äútoxic community‚Äù reputation. IMO Epic has fostered this community to be this way so it may as well be everyone that‚Äôs happy.",FortNiteBR

Hey Everyone, You might not know me but Im just here to say that i will be having a break from Fortnite and this subreddit for a while. This is mostly down to Fortnite causing me to get enraged very easily, and personally i feel like my mental health with go down to the absolute low if i keep playing. This isnt because of the recent event, no, but infact that I have to do atleast 6 hours of training each day to even be decent in division 6, or even in the normal game modes. I honestly feel like my happiness with the state of the game has been drained these last 2 seasons, mostly thanks to an unbelieveable amount of toxic soccer skins who jump to conclusions and say either ""get gud lul"" or "" Just Build lol."" Make Sure that you are still having fun with the game, and not taking it too seriously like i did. It you do take it seriously, just make sure you keep your self esteem high, and not get angered easily.

I almost have to applaud them,"So I don‚Äôt know if mods are removing posts about this topic because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a hot debate so I won‚Äôt say directly what I‚Äôm referring too, but it has to do with the smg that got reintroduced today. You know, the extremely broken smg. The most broken weapon in Fortnite history is now back in the game because you the player voted on it. Epic truly knew what they were doing. Like Dr. Lupo said on stream as it was happening, there was never any chance any of the other items got reintroduced. Epic chose items that couldn‚Äôt rival said smg. They wanted to bring it back to help out bad players even more without any of the repercussion. Now whenever people like myself complain, all they have to say is ‚Äúyou the community made this decision, it‚Äôs not our fault‚Äù although none of those other items were clearly going to win. 

So Epic lets have another poll and let the community decide if Siphon or double pump should return. It‚Äôs funny that this is the first thing you ever let us decide. We won‚Äôt ever get a pill to bring back siphon or double pump because both of those benefit the good players more than the bad players. Truly some of the shadiest stuff I‚Äôve seen in a very long while. It just amplified my desire for the day this game dies. Probably won‚Äôt be any time soon, but you won‚Äôt have a community once the masses leave. The hardcore audience will be the first to go. Well everyone, have fun abusing the broken gun. I want everyone to abuse it. Run 4 or 5 at a time and hold no remorse. W key your opponent all day every day with said gun. Will be laughably fun and overall terrible for the health of the game, which already is far from healthy. GGs Epic, you just played us all and technically it‚Äôs not your fault and I‚Äôm fully expecting y‚Äôall to use that as an argument as this gun receives more and more hate. ‚ÄúYa‚Äôll made the decision, not us‚Äù lmfao",FortNiteBR

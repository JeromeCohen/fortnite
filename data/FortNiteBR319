Good players are being punished. I'm by no means amazing but I feel like I'm good enough to hold my own against most players. But this all started with shotgun delay update. The quick edit plays were made near enough impossible and still are harder to pull of than they used to be. 

The port-a-fort is also something that bugs me, I know a lot of people don't really have a problem with it but I hate the fact you can out build someone and then just throw down one of those things and instantly be above you. 

Jet pack is by far the most irritating thing added to the game so far. I get that it's a limited time item but it doesn't have a place in a game like fortnite. If someone falls when they've been out-built they shouldn't be allowed to just fly to survive. Same as when someone can just instantly fly above and have height advantage.

I get that Epic doesn't want to make fortnite unappealing to new players and therefore want to help them out but when a lot of people first started none of these things were in the game. The only way to get better was by failing. But now as long as you've got a jet pack and a port-a-fort you can survive and be above everyone just by holding space bar",FortNiteBR

The reason this is the meta is because **good** players know how to **build**.  You are lucky if you can get one or two AR shots on someone who can react fast enough. Then after that there is no reason to try to AR them.

This game’s skillgap comes from building. Unless they take that away, good players will always win against bad players because of that.

It doesnt matter if they have two pumps, one pump, pump tac, pump heavy, any combination of guns. If they can outbuild you, then its gonna be over.

If they take out double pump then pump tac will rise again. It is important to good players that they use double shotgun because you only have split seconds to shoot another builder. It will **always** be the meta because of the way the skillgap works in this game.",FortNiteBR

I suggest making the llamma drop:

- 200 wood, brick and metal in solos
- 350 wood, brick and metal in duos
- 500 wood, brick and metal in squads

Building is the only mechanic this game has that puts it above the rest, why are you continuously nerfing the amount of mats you get from floor stacks, certain trees and e.t.c. And now Llamas. Everytime I get into a good building battle with someone where we both have at least 1000 collective mats we end it with both of us at barely 200. Now the winner has to go gather mats mid game and if he gets in another fight he will most likely lose because of it. I remember back in the when the small green tress used to give you anywhere between 40-60 wood. Or the big swamp trees scathered through the map, which had low hp but gave a lot of mats. Now they have 600 and barely give 40 wood despite there not being many scattered across the map anyway. Please stop nerfing material gathering after this point. Why should someone have to stop mid game or end game to farm materials because everyone has such a limited amount. It doesn't add a skill gap or anything, it is just tedious.

Please sign my moveon.org petition:

1. Epic please remove all rockets, rocket ammo, grenades, or actually any type of guns. These only cause division among the player base. 

2. Make llamas similar to vending machines. You have to sacrifice 500 of each material to have the joy of seeing the confetti come out of the llama. However, please make sure the llamas do not drop ANYTHING in return.

3. Since there are no weapons in the game, people will have to use their GUILE and SMARTS to make it to the final circle. To do so... all floor loot is changed to TRAPS. While each of these traps will have to be nerfed to do 1 damage to ensure the game is balanced, supply drops will include portaforts. Imagine the sick clips that Nick Eh 30 will pull off by stacking 4 portaforts and lining all four sides with traps all the way down.

4. To ensure the game is balanced, no more mats in floor loot, chests, or supply drops. Instead, you can farm for mats. However, we as a team decided that all mat harvesting had to be reduced by 90%, for our servers sake. Cant handle all those damn mats.

maybe because im on console, i dont see it often, but i mean how are you getting hit by 2 shotguns? you get hit, build. you must be a bad player, this reminds me of destiny ""it killed me nerf it"", instead of learning to counter it(building)

its like getting double bodied by a sniper, what are you doing that lets you get hit, twice, by a sniper(yes i know you have to be accurate, time travel, bulley drop).

sorry but i can only assume the noobs/people who cant build are whining, in which, you are the problem, not the shotgun, i mean what more do you want to do to them?

delay, inconsistent(spread/damage), sometimes you need two lol, i can tell you there are moments where one shot does sub 50 damage, next one does 100\+

""pump one shotting op"" you're kidding, you mean a shotgun, a cqc high damage weapon is one shotting you? JFL, so now i cant just one shot and forget? i have to follow up with another shot or switch to another weapon? this will do nothing but get more people killed, then people getting one\-pumped

sadly, epic will listen to the trashcans and probably end up nerfing shotguns because people cant counter it and just want something they die to nerfed, just like destiny, dont adapt, just whine and get your way gg",FortNiteBR

I currently can get all the pieces but that is due having lots of free time. Some individuals do not have free time. Some individuals might have bought all the tiers because they don’t have time to grind for 100 tiers.

The llama nerf is nonsensical and stupid: there are only THREE llamas in the ENTIRE MAP per match. THREE. Only THREE players would be able to get the mats from them. Finding those llamas is such a ridiculously low possibility already that it baffles me how Epic considered it to need nerfs.

The floor loot nerf is also infuriating. Materials are already boring enough to farm and stacks of 30 wood were already useless and a very low amount to begin with. Why reduce it? In fact, you should've INCREASED it. Gathering materials is a slow and tedious process as it is and it's the main reason why everyone loves Blitz.

And even though I understand the concern for rocket spamming late-game, the explosive ammo nerf won't do absolutely anything to prevent it. Gathering rockets was also very hard as it is. Each ammo box you opened had a *chance* to get a stack of only **two** rockets. Yes, that's right. **Two**. Rocket spam only happens at late-game because you can quickly gather a good amount of explosive ammo by looting it from other players. It doesn't have anything to do with the chances of actually finding explosive ammo to begin with. This change just makes the explosive weapons less useful at early game, but they will still be very much spammable mid to late-game.

I honestly can't understand these changes, *specially* the llamas and materials nerfs. No one ever complained about any of it. Please, just revert the changes.",FortNiteBR

Every day each ""tile"" would have a uncommon, rare, epic or legendary item in it. (Different for every player)

Uncommon: 50% chance

Rare: 25% chance

Epic: 10%

Legendary: 1% chance

For instance, my daily items tommorow could have 3 uncommons, 2 rares and 1 epic.


-Some more ideas:

No more than 3 uncommons per reset

Some tiles would have a small chance of being a free 100 v bucks 

Skins or items you already own would NOT be randomly chosen. If you refunded a skin there will always be an option to buy it again. (so you don't have to wait if you change your mind.)

New items would have their own section, and featured items would stay the same.

New loading screens, sprays, and stickers could be sold as a pack of 5 in the uncommon rarity.

There would always be at least 1 of each item type (emote, harvesting tool, skin, glider)

There would be NO duplicates in the same reset



-The pros of having this system would be 

1: more variety in items people have
2: have a fun ""loot box"" system WITHOUT paying
3: people would stop asking ""please add back X item"" on Twitter
4: cool videos on YouTube where someone got all legendaries

-The cons of having this system would be

1: people hate change
2: it might be too similar to a loot box system

However, when things goes wrong, the community gets upset in a very understanding way just to get Epic attentions to keep the players happy.
  Like, players begging to remove jetpacks because they thought it will kill (or damage I'm guessing) to game (didn't Epic *supposedly* scrapped the jetpack idea when it first announced months ago?) 

But that's not what I'm posting this for. I'm posting this because of the recent update about the Llama's nerf (community heavily downvoted Epic's post for the very first time in the subreddit). Will Epic ever going to do a hotfix after listening to the players' complaints later on or just leave the nerf alone?",FortNiteBR

Only downside is this game boils my blood and brings a rage inducing state that has led me to punching a hole in my wall. I am fairly good and progression rank had been no issue, but I have to stop playing before I end up breaking things. As soon as I start doing bad and dying early or losing to stupid shit (jetpack double pump and rocket that goes through wall lol how) I lose it and have to close the game.

I can't get back on either because once my anger has begun, my mood and attitude towards the game is set for the day. Sometimes I can't even play the next day because it pisses me off so much. I love it though, I want to play more because when I'm winning or getting a lot of kills I'm enjoying myself.

1) They are in a way, easy\-mode impulse grenades. Those impulse plays where you fly across the map towards your enemy or up into a fort? Now it's much easier to pull off PLUS you don't take any risk of fall damage even if you mess up and completely miss the mark. But impulse grenade plays were also cool because they had some difficulty and were risky, and they took up a slot in the inventory. High\-risk high\-reward, but now these pads are low\-risk high\-reward.  


2) They don't take up a slot, you can have a ton of them without sacrificing another weapon/item. Yesterday in a game that I won, I ended up with a stack of 18 of these. It's not rare at all. In a few days, you will deal with these all the time. Think Jump Rocks were lame? Now you can carry em' around all the time.   


3) Stair\-rushing is effective but you still have to suffer the difficulty of going from low\-ground to high\-ground. A decent player in a fort can burst you down with an AR as you're coming up, spam your stairs down or use explosives to destroy it. Now they can just bounce up into your fort after a stair or two from a further distance. And these pads are so easily available that you will deal with this scenario very often. You think you've secured some sort of highground advantage in your 3\-story high fort? It'll be gone in a second and it won't even be hard for them.  


4) Now, massive build battles have almost no risk. In a build battle, players had to take into account the possibilty of going too high and taking fall damage if you're not careful.  Now it's not even a concern, just jump off using a bounce pad. There is absolutely no risk in mindlessly building up, you don't even have to consider the pros and cons anymore. ",FortNiteBR

Lately are a lot of comments complaining about farming, and the time it takes and about why is the most boring part of the match. But farming for me is great. Is like farming in League of Legends. Imagine LOL without farming, and only 5vs5 PVP all the match. 

Farming add a balance of the game and one of the most important mechanics of a competitive game: The decision making. Why? Because when you are farming, you have to expend time of the match doing that and not doing other thing. And that results in priorities, and advantages/disadvantages about your choices.

How many matchs you lose because you ran out of materials? Well, the reason behind that is clearly because you make bad decision in the early or mid game or because you decided to prioritize other aspects before farming. So, in a competitive game, that kind of decisions are great, because your result in the end depends on those small decisions.

Yes, for the casual average player is a boring thing, but for the quality and good enviroment of a competitive game it is a necessary mechanic that adds balance and priorities in game.

You nerfed how many materials we can get from furniture, yet no one asked for this change. 

And now, both Llamas and floor loot? What was the problem? 
with 3 Llamas per game I honestly don't think anyone had a problem that 3 random players saved a few minutes by not having to harvest materials. Specially considering how rare it ism 

With all due respect, can you stop messing with things we think are fine ans start with things we think are broken?

Sorry if I came out disrespectful, its just my way of putting things.

Now, epic is nerfing mats AGAIN. They’re making the mats drop in stacks of 20, not 30. Also, they’re decreasing the chance of mats spawning. 

To make things worse they’ve merged llamas to give 200 of each mat, not 500, and they’ve also removed damage fall off to player made structures

I would expect with the good feedback from blitz, epic would buff mats, but it seems they did just the opposite.

They keep going in the direction of materials being nerfed. It doesn’t make sense. The reason people enjoy blitz so much is because they can gain materials quicker and it’s faster paced, which equals more action. 

It simply adds up to the fact that Epic needs to make Blitz a permanent mode. Solo, duo, and squads.

I think the best solution to this is to change the way shotguns shoot: after the player presses the button to fire, the character pumps the shotgun before firing. Now, instead of being able to one-shot some poor soul the moment he rounds a corner, you would have to keep the crosshairs on him for half a second, something that would take serious skill to do. In addition, you can't shoot someone the moment they peek out of their base, giving more if a reason to use other weapons that instantly fire in close-range combat such as SMGs and tacs. Not only would this shift up the meta, it would turn the pump shotgun from the gun every noskin without an ounce of skill wins fights with to a weapon that is hard to master but destructive once you do. 

TLDR: Giving the shotgun a delay before firing would make it a more skill based weapon and balance in out against other close-range options.

The biggest problem with the phasing in my opinion is that it typically in my experience from playing and watching streams and videos is it punishes the better player, usually the quicker builder or better player gets the high ground on someone and the other player just jumps directly through their ramp/wall or shoots them through it as if it was never there.

Personally, I used mouse button bindings for Ramps and walls since December, but I've recently switched to using keyboard bindings such as Q, X, C and V, due to the amount of keyboard builders I've seen.

I had two ideas of how this could work:

One was that it you drink it like a shield and you have a bar that can fill you 100 or so and before you take damage to your actual health you would first take damage from that, similar to how shields work.

The other way is that it could still be a consumable like shields but instead of it just absorbing the damage it makes you completely immune to fall damage, maybe it could have like a certain number of uses for each one that you drink. Like if you drink it then you can fall from a distance where you would normally take fall damage but it absorbs it and after it runs out you take damage or you can consume another one.

This would however mostly help skilled players especially when they are in build fights. Imagine you being in a build fight and the other guy/girl decides to shoot you down, this way you will be able to not take fall damage and actually have a gun fight with somebody. 

I was thinking that it could be like a purple or blue rarity and maybe it drops similar to a slurp, drops one at a time and you can carry a max of two.

Please feel free to provide some CONSTRUCTIVE criticism in the comments

TL;DR A new shield type consumable that reduces or removes fall damage that can be carried in stacks of two and they drop in stacks of one.",FortNiteBR

**What**

The Chat Team at Reddit reached out to us recently to test a new feature they’ve been developing: subreddit chat rooms \(see their [r/modnews](https://new.reddit.com/r/modnews) post\). Admins and mods have been wanting to create an open dialogue and closer partnership so that features being developed on Reddit are specifically designed for our communities and our use cases.

**Why**

The reason the admins want to work closely with us to enable chat rooms is the feature is still early and there’s still a lot of work to be done \- but enabling chat rooms on real communities with real users will allow all of us \(mods &amp; admins\) to learn what works, what doesn’t, and will help shape the future of this chat product on Reddit.

We know not everyone wants to chat \- that’s fine, nobody will be forced to use this feature. We know that the posts/comments are a core part of our community \- it will stay that way. We see chat rooms as a way to supplement and enhance a lot of the things we’re already doing.

A lot of users on this thread when posting to team up are usually done playing by the time they get a response. We're hoping this new feature will allow users to quickly find teammates so they can get some wins!

**How does it work**

*  **Access** ***will roll out throughout the day, you may not have access right away but will soon!***
* You can access chat rooms in our sidebar \(redesign only\) or you can open chat \(you will have a chat icon next to your mail icon at the top of the page\) and you will have a new “Rooms” tab which will allow you to view and join our rooms.
* Our subreddit rules still apply \- if you break our rules in chat you will face the same consequences as breaking the rules anywhere else on the sub. This also means bans work both ways within the chat room and subreddit so please be respectful and mature on both platforms.
* Chat rooms have moderation capabilities for mods to make sure the chat rooms stay civil, respectful, and on topic. Remember, chat is real time and in many ways more personal \- please be kind and good to each other. Don’t say anything you wouldn’t say publicly in a comment.
* This is only available on web, but a mobile version will be coming in June\^TM
* Don’t be alarmed if room disappears as we're using today as a day to test the new rooms for LFG within the subreddit, with hopes that this can be a permanent addition to the sub.

**Give feedback**

Your feedback about subreddit chat rooms is just as important to admins as the feedback we will be giving as mods. Please send your feedback on the chatroom to our modmail, or submit your feedback in [r/community\_chat](https://new.reddit.com/r/community_chat) directly. We are working closely with the admins because we believe this feature could be good for our community and for many other communities like ours \- we have the opportunity to shape this feature into something that belongs on Reddit. Thanks for your time \- and we’re looking forward to chatting.",FortNiteBR

I am 28 and work 10 hours a day, with busy weekends. I am able to play at least 2 hours after work of fornite. Usually play with friends and family and the game has been super fun and enjoyable. I am around level 31 and tier 49, have finished the first 3 weeks of the battle pass and almost done with week 4 and 5. There are around 30 days left on the season and i honestly dont see how i can rack up enough game time to reach level 80 and finish the OMEGA skin challenge. I 100% understand rewarding a player for their time and commitment towards a game, but some of us cant push out 6+ hours a day on a game to reach these goals, and i feel this excludes a large amount of the players base from being able to obtain these rewards. Especially rewards they put behind a paywall. If fornite is going to reward players based on level and time committed to the game then this should be done through the Free Pass Challenges tiers not through the paywall of the battle pass. We are already investing money to support the game with the battle pass and feel the rewards should be obtainable for both the casual and hardcore gamer. I feel like i will be able to get tier 100 by the end of the season for the OMEGA skin but i dont see how i will be to get enough levels to complete the skin. Then if you try and use this incomplete skin, the hardcore players will just make fun of the OMEGA skin because its not complete, so as a casual player why would never use that skin. At the very least they should convert the challenges to carry over to next season and allow the player to complete them over time and not constrain them to that single season. Sorry for the long rant, all in all i dont mind putting in the time i can to obtain the stuff i want, just its unfair to some of the player base who would like to have a completed skin. 

TL:DR Fornite makes it impossible to complete OMEGA Skin challenges for casual players. Level and time commitment rewards should not be included behind paywalls and should be take of the Free Pass Challenge. ",FortNiteBR

The game mode is brilliant, adding to the already fast paced game play. However the end game \(where the storm just collapses in on itself\) needs to be changed in my opinion. 

Too often it feels like a very random end to the game with a number of players just hiding, building, scrambling for survival. I feel if Epic were to have the very end of the game finish how it does in standard games, then it would be far more rewarding and fun to play.

I get it, for the new players who are just starting to get in on the hype of BR its frustrating. Majority of the players are going to be way more skilled than you and your going to be one pumped in the face in your default skin trying to shoot him with an smg. But you will get better at the game the more you play it. Stick with the game, learn how to build and fire your weapons and the game will start to feel natural to you.  Its not going to happen overnight. You’ll get the hang of it and start to get better every game. 

The LTM mode will destroy the process of the game. Why should one player be able to master building in one day of sandbox mode where other players took hundreds of games to learn. Same goes with shooting. 

Another reason the sandbox mode isn’t going to benefit anyone is because its not live action gameplay, your not going to become a better player unless you hop into solo and land tilted and mess people up. Playing against other people will improve your skills and strategy. 

I just think the whole idea is bad for the game in general. I love the fact that the only way to play this game is to jump into BR and compete. Nothing would take away that competition like sandbox. ",FortNiteBR

#**Shotguns shouldn’t be removed, but something needs done.**

I’ve noticed a lot lately that everything in this game is about shotguns. I’m on an average skill level, but shotguns bug me even when I hit my shots. It’s just something about having to carry two shotguns every game just to have a chance at survival. I loved Solid Gold because of no shotguns except a rare heavy in v2. I think EPIC should figure something out with it, here are a few ideas.

#**Possible Fixes**

##Add a new gamemode.

A new gamemode be shotgun-less^? would be great

##Add Back Solid Gold

Solid Gold was great for an alternative cool down to the base game.

##Sniper Shootout v3

Sniper shootout was a fun gamemode, seeing people at point blank range missing all their shots. Sniper shout out was fun.

With it, the exclusive battle pass skins and challenges with it. However, two items, the Carbide and Omega skin have level challenged which require you to spend a rather large amount of time playing. Time which a lot of players don't have. \\

The question is what is going to happen to players who are halfway through or at the last part of the Omega and Carbide challenged and the season ends. Money, and time wasted with the ultimate goal lost.

My suggestion is that when the season ends, you don't get locked away from that final skin upgrade. Instead you have the challenges replaced with a Victory Royale meter.

1 Win For the first

5 Wins for the second

10 Wins For the third

20 Wins For the fourth

40 WinsFor the 5th

LTM Wins count towards this

This way, players are not locked away from a half finished skin.

I know this goes back to the 'Should I be given the ending for purchasing the game/pack' argument, but time gating something important in a game such as the Tier100 skin upgrades away behind time that some players, like students, just don't have seems unfair, and I would only expect this to drive players away.

The skin upgrade system is a fantastic idea, and should defiantly be implemented more in the future. However, you can't run from the question forever.",FortNiteBR

Epic, what is your plan with the pump? First you had double pump, then you removed it, and now it's back and better than ever with even more potential. Or the fact that it is still the most inconsistent weapon in the game capable of one shotting any player no matter the skill, building, or player using it. Epic, at this point I just want a response. Tell us if you're working on adjustments or you're just gonna leave it as is. Tell us what your plans are with the pump or what we can expect from it. Tell us that you have read and considered all of our feedback about it. Tell us anything. ",FortNiteBR

___________________________________

1. Press g.

2. Click out the squares you'd like to edit.

3. Press g to confirm.

**My suggestion would be this: (of course it would be toggleable, like turbobuilding)**

1. Press g to activate editing.

2. Press mouse button down, hold it and cut out squares.

3. When u let go of the mouse button it confirms the edit.

Can we not make a challenge where i have to have 3 other friends follow me to dance on a pad. Maybe on the first 2 days everyone was nice and danced but now it's just one or two getting slaughtered or me having to kill them while trying to dance on the freaking pad. I don't really squad up now that i am older. I love this game (PC) and like doing the challenges but forcing me to squad to complete is silly. All other squad challenges i would just go to squad and not fill. It wouldn't even be fair for me to join a squad because sometimes my kid or wife need something and i will leave the game because i will put them first. Just my thoughts. I am sure i will get many who disagree and i understand that as well.,FortNiteBR

481,MegapellicanOne,1528167494,8onf3f,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8onf3f/picking_my_brain/,0,Picking my brain,"Just for starters, I think this build battle stuff is annoying, repetitive, takes little skill, and just not fun. But, building is part of the game and that’s fine if some people enjoy it. Whatever floats your boat. 

For the record, I play on console so everything I’m about to say is based off of watching other players play on PC. 

It seems like PC players don’t react to buildings. I’m not saying all PC players don’t react, but some of the players just seem helpless when someone starts building on them. I was watching a stream where this dude was literally building in the sky, and could’ve easily been shot down but the opponent just tried to build up to him. Don’t just tell me he’s stupid or has bad plays, because I see it happen quite often. I see some building/build battles, and I also see some people who just don’t seem like they know what to do. PC seems easier. More people play PC, so there’s a higher chance for newer/worse players. I get that. 

I understand I’ll get hate for my “attacks” on the PC community. I’m just legitimately trying to figure out why some of these players look like bots. You start building up on them on console and they’ll just pop out and shoot you down. Doesn’t seem to happen on PC. But it’s the same building styles and everything. 

PC players: Am I missing something? I understand there are differences in the scenes but it just seems way easier to play PC when you’ve mastered the controls of PC. It just seems, from what I’ve played and seen, that console players have more building smarts. 

Thanks for the information. ",FortNiteBR

I'm thinking of maybe 25-50% faster on each one who revives, not too much, but enough to make a difference in fights.

I have been tryharding solo squads and lost **every single** game but this is the most amount of fun ive had on Fortnite in a LONG TIME.

-	**Increased loot around the map** = Less RNG, which means more chance of surviving early game.

-	**More resource materials** = **Build battles galore**. &lt; Main reason why I play this game.

-	**Circle spawns before players jump** = Midgame is action packed.

This mode heavily favours the aggressive player and there is hardly any dull moments such as farming or spending minutes looking for the best loot.

All these features along with redeploy-able gliders makes the fun unparalleled to any other game I have played.

Blitz overall is a more enjoyable / balanced version of fortnite and should be the **staple** for this game and the competitive scene.

**Please make Blitz a permanent mode.**

But I thought I’d explain why that is, just for your sanity.

Console players severely underestimate the amount that aim assist helps. Turn off aim assist and you won’t get any kills at all.

No, you haven’t suddenly gotten worse at the game. A couple months ago, a significant change to aim assist was made in an attempt to fix an abuse of the mechanic. Some people would constantly re-aim or spam ADS at close ranges to become extremely accurate with sub machine guns. In order to fix this, a change was made to weaken aim assist on these weapons. It wasn’t in the patch notes but it was pretty clear when it happened (/r/fortnitecompetitive noticed it immediately).

I’m not saying to buff the sub machine guns to their former glory, I’m just explaining this to people who don’t know about it. So if you’re still using sub machine guns because you “used to be really good with them”, keep this is mind.

So many posts on reddit that suggests double pump back but with a slight nerf. But people say double pump was a glitch. In fact the removed double pump twice and added it back twice before the huge nerf to pumps in season 4. And if you say double pump was a glitch that means that you are a new player that did not get the satisfaction of double pump.
       In order to solve this problem, Epic should add another shooting test where you could use double pump and add recoil pattern. That helps new players and encourage them to not go with spray meta.

TL/DR: What did you think when you first played Fortnite? Comment and Tell me!
 
Im a CoD and halo guy, and everyone seemed to love this free game back in September/October of last year. I finally convinced myself to get it in October 2017.

Personally, I had NEVER  played a third person shooter game in my life,  nor had I seen gameplay of this game or any other battle royale game. The thing that interested me about it was that Fortnite was like the Hunger Games, in a way. And so I started my Fortnite journey.

Since I came from CoD and Halo, Fortnite was so freakin quiet. The map was big, unlike any I had seen before.

Anyway, since no one at all knew how to build, weapons were the name of the game, and silence. I don’t know if I was taught wrong, but the people who I played with told me that you needed to be extra quite and sneak around, because it was dangerous if anyone found you or you were caught out in the open. I remember my first game, following a friend, hiding in houses, running under trees. We didn’t see anyone in a duo game until they killed us and we placed 7th. Man it was intense.

It was weird because there might have been 100 people, but I never dropped at popular places and never heard anyone until they were right on me. Back then, even breaking a car or shooting one was super dangerous and it felt like the noise could be heard around for miles.

Also, I didn’t know how much damage the storm did. All I was told was that it meant *death*. I was so scared of the storm I made sure I got to that circle. Hell, I didn’t die to the storm even once until sometime In January.

Anyway, because the storm moving in was so important, the sound of the timer going off, and the sound signifying the storm moving on was kind of scary too.

And the sound of that electric trap.  That was something cool too.

I remember that Anarchy Acers was a place of death, that you shouldn’t go to until after everyone had left it. I always died at Tomato town, so after playing 30 games or so, i never dropped there again until middle of season 2.  Flush factory was definitely a cool place to go.

Also, friendly fire was on. Now that was a pain in squads. It seemed like a quarter of the games involved one or more teammates waiting until you got good loot, then they killed you.  The very first high explosives game was especially frustrating as  trolls would blow you up then pick you up just to kill you again. I remember seeing all the Reddit clips of instant karma where the team killer got killed instead. Good times.

Then there was dancing! I had t bagging in other games, but seeing dancing in a game definitely interested me. Of course there was only one dance at the time, but it added to the game and made it super fun.

Oh yeah, and remember when you saw a black knight in mid season 2? Now that was some scary shit. 
If you had a black knight coming to fight you, you were a dead man. Much respect was given to black knight.

No one has really figured out a meta, weapon wise, and everything was used, although the rocket launcher was better because not many people built much to protect themselves. Also, getting a gold or purple weapon always was exciting because of how rare they were.

Anyway, yeah, being from the kind of games I played, Fortnite was so unusual and cool, and so fun, even though I barely ever won.

Yeah, I wish we could go back to those times to relive how awesome it was, but the game is great now too. Just always cool to think about and remember where it started.

If you read this, thanks for doing so. 
I’d love to hear your story! Tell me about when you first started and your thoughts

Crashes into the fortnite island, with the visitor inside. The visitor awakens and finds himself here and has to find a way to return home. He escapes the divot, uses the hop rocks (as they are most likely from his home world / asteroid) to power the rocket from the movie set at the villain base. He uses it to escape. Up to here it’s pretty simple, past the rocket launch is where it gets hard to decipher. The rocket either went wrong or right for the visitor. He either failed and caused those inter-dimensional rifts and is now lost in oblivion, or he succeeded and the rifts are just a byproduct of him returning home. Either way, rifts are spawned, causing worlds to collide (Season 5) durr burger, noms, motel and the lonely lodge sign all disappear into the rifts, while a Viking village, Easter island heads, and other things come from our world into the fortnite world. 

The rifts slowly start to disappear and energy is expelled from the main one in the sky. This eventually spawns the cube as the big rift fades away. The cube is a living energy being, it is sentient. It knows it where to find energy and I think it was trying to gather more energy on the way to return through the rift. The runes Kevin left were most likely him recharging / having a rest (hence the 24hrs between movements during a rune printing). Kevin then made his way into the lake and dissolved, finding another resting spot under the house to recharge. Season 6 rolls around, darkness rises. 
The cube rises from the lake and floats around the island, Max energy, recollects the energy from the runes he left and eventually goes back to loot lake, with the runes now left useless near salty. 

This is where my theory comes in, I believe the rifts have these sentient being inside them, those being the butterflies. These butterflies restore order in the different dimensions of the fortnite universe. When the cube was dripping it’s energy into the vortex below it, during the event, I believe the cube was going to explode causing max destruction, until BAM the rift butterflies save everyone on the island and teleports them to the “in-between” this saves them and the island. 
The cube was stopping from exploding and in turn the butterflies used that energy to make loot lake beautiful again. This also works now that the runes are clearing up and grass is growing again. 

That’s my theory, it’s not fact, this is just what I have come up with. I’d love to hear what you guys think 

(Quick note on the enforcers; I agree with the theory they’re some sort of space police, they brought the motel sign back from wherever its ended up) ",FortNiteBR

This gun is insane. It is meta-changing its so good. This gun has shifted the game back toward accuracy and precision over spraying and praying.

When a player picks up a mini gun or a p90 and lets loose, he opens himself up to a couple clean headshots from this gun. This gun will help encourage building and accuracy over the previous meta. 

Now, granted, I think the game is pretty much perfect where it is right now. It is challenging but no gun is game breaking. There are (finally) multiple strategies to play with and each of them have their positives and negatives. I’m so glad that the homing missile, semi-sniper, and dual pistols are finally gone and before, they really messed with the pro strategies. Now, you can build and be aggressive, or snipe and play passive, you can camp, you can hide, you can even float around in the air with balloons. Each of these strategies are part of what makes this game so fun. Each of them work, they don’t dominate each other, and they can all be used to place well or earn a victory.

Some of the things I would like to change about this gun are not super bad and, I think, would benefit the game. Firstly, lower the drop of this gun. I get at least 3 every game. Everybody has one. A lower drop chance would mean that this gun isn’t so OP and would make it more sought after. Secondly, reduce the long ranged damage. I keep getting “sniped” in the face with this gun from 150m+ it has a really long range and if it was shorter, it would be a lot more balanced (similar to the suppressed AR). 

Aside from these few simple changes, Epic please, don’t blast this gun down into the pit that shotguns were blasted down into. It is a really cool meta-changing gun. It has the nicest gun sounds in the game. 

I’m open for discussion. What are your thoughts and opinions on this gun? Feedback would be appreciated.

What lead me to think that something is wrong is when you see people play kb+m for the first time. A while back, Ceeday posted a video of trying keyboard and mouse. He got more kills than I have ever gotten in a normal game. One of my friends (that I can beat in a 1v1) got 10 KILLS IN A SQUADS GAME. And he was new to kb+m.

(Peaceful and Happy) as opposed to the other timeline which we were in which was full of darkness and evil. (The cube and runes.( Loved kevin though.)) the bad timeline ultimately stops at the cubes explosion and gives the animation of the butterfly. The butterfly effect kicks in when our players touched the butterfly. As the butterfly effect by chaos theory states “It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly’s wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.” The player touching the butterfly animation takes place in the beam above the villains base, and like said before represents the splitting of the timelime.

There are also a lot of players who I think are very good, who are maybe overlooked or havent done a lot of competitive play. For example, 100T Kenith, Hamlinz, and High Distortion

Epic, many people are saying that there are too many ARs in the game, and that you would vault one (possibly) So, if this is true, PLEASE don’t vault the bursts. (TLDR below)

~OTHER CHOICES~
If your reasoning is to keep the game fresh and alive, then why don’t you vault an AR that literally is another AR, but with a silencer. IMO, the silenced AR is a silenced scar, but with more bloom and less damage. The scar has been a perfectly balanced gun for a long time (excluding 98 dmg headshots) that’s been favorited by many players. I can probably say on the behalf of all players, the scar is probably the best weapon in the game, or at least in the top 3. So when you get a balanced gun, that shouldn’t be altered in any way, and when you make a new form of it, it wouldn’t be as good. Sure many players prefers silenced (sc)ARs over regular scars, and if you do then answer this. Would your end game, or your game in general be changed if you had a scar instead of a silenced (sc)AR? Especially the model, the silenced is really just a copy in paste, and the bloom on it is triggering, so if you’re going to remove one of many to keep this game fresh, why not remove the one that’s literally another weapon, silenced.

~WHY ELSE~
If we want to keep this game fresh and not repetitive, then why try to remove such a limited weapon type? We have many automatic firing weapons (season 5 is a good example), we have many semi-auto weapons like the new, Heavy AR, and many single firing weapons, but the burst? We only have it in AR form. We have the FAMAS and the standard grey, green, and blue one. They are just in AR form. Removing them also removes a whole new play style. I run Pump/Heavy + Burst, so I don’t really pick up SMGS, but they weren’t put to be a backup weapon, but an assault rifle. They are a new form of play style. Epic, many people run Automatic AR, Shotgun, SMG, and heals. With the exception of splodes or sniper. But other people change that, they choose a style they want to run, and removing the burst only hurts those people. This all does already seem biased, but I am one of those people. So to limit our options to something we don’t really like working with or something that just doesn’t suit us and to call that making this game fresh? There are other things to add and/or remove, and maybe ARs should just be left alone in that case. Now the Heavy AR just came so we can’t really have to many opinions influenced or made, but maybe that’s a stopping point, or at least a break on touching the AR department ya’ know? 

~CONCLUSION AND TLDR~
Removing the burst won’t keep this game fresh. Remove repetitive or more unused weapons. You should be tweaking more with the pistols in the game like the grey and green standard ones. From last season to this season, you’ve removed so many machine guns and spray weapons as well as high ground tactics to better “fix” your game epic, instead of trying to fix the worse problems already present, but you just did simple nerfs and moved on. I don’t want to be salty and say “Im QuItInG nOw”, but I just came to at least make you think again, IF you remove an AR, because 1 person isn’t enough to make a business decision.

TLDR: Keep bursts and look at other weapon departments, and also the silenced (sc)AR if you’re trying to keep the game fresh. It’s a different type of play style that you don’t commonly see and I truly believe bursts should be kept because they do make the game newer to other people that want a game changer instead of using the standard meta.

I saw this one guy write that he wants to use the new skin with a black shield. He got downvoted to hell and accused of a sweaty. Like seriously guys, grow up. I'll tell you a couple of reasons why sweaty skins aren't bad and why people buy them.

1. ""Sweaty skins"" make you confident. Yes you heard right. I bought plenty of blue and green skins because I feel more confident playing them knowing that people may be more scared of me than if I would use DJ Yonder. Also many pro players use them and if you are a fan of Faze Cloak, for example, then you'll sure are more likely to buy commando knowing that he uses it often.

2. Most of them are pretty cheap and since almost all sweaty skins have the base model of a female character, and males are *usually* attracted to females, so they prefer using them. Also they have a smaller player model and aren't as clunky as for example Raven, Wukong, Musha, etc... 

Also people still get shitted on here for playing stretched. Everyone who is even a tad bit competitve hss probably considered, if not already, playing stretched. It gives you a competitve advantage and you just don't want to miss out on that. If it's hurting your eyes then stop lying because it isn't. A 15 second clip of somebody playing on stretched isn't getting you killed.

1) Fading through builds.

2) Re-deployment

3) Explosives in general

4) Reverting Back to old Material amount

5) Guns/Items not being added to the game every week 

These are just a few of the changes that came to mind when thinking of how good this game actually was when it was actually fun. Even if these are permanent changes (hopefully they will be) just add them to a separate playlist so the people who actually read your game can enjoy it again.

I like the game just the way it is, new additions are always welcomed, like the grappler, silenced AR's, etc. But we need some balance for christ sake.

If you have a 100 shield and get 1 tapped by that thing you are forced to use a full shield otherwise you can get 2 tapped because a headshot does 90 freaking damage.

It homogonizes travel.  All previous modes of transportation had a certain value prior to the implementation of glider re-deploy.  Their value was, for the most part, pretty balanced and fit in the context of the game.  Why is this important?  Because entering engagements against a variety of players is the strength of this game.  Variety is the backbone of any good BR game.

Reason # 2.  It homogonizes team fights.  Before glider redeploy, fighting opponents would infold in a wide variety of ways.  Now all team fights end with either your squad flying in on an opposing team, or you getting dropped on by an opposing team.  Glider redeploy has greatly diminished the variety of how team fights to play out.

Sure, there are more reasons but I think Glider Re-deploy brings many more cons and pros and thus must be taken out of the game.",FortNiteBR

And one thing that almost never gets mentioned: the tick speed for your health when you're downed is doubled. Why?? Who has EVER thought to themselves ""you know what would make this game great? If I died quicker!"" or ""I wish the final circle was more rng than it already is!"" (I don't even need to speak for the glider) 

The only purpose these changes seem to have is to make everyone as uncomfortable as possible while playing. To make sure you never feel like you KNOW the game. That's not 'fun' it's FRUSTRATING. Especially since these changes are being done often against what the community wants again and again.

I can't count how many final circles I've been in that land BEHIND the other player. Or how many duos matches have ended with me playing solo.

It fundamentally changes the game in such a huge way, entirely for the worse. The meta had already become too build-dependent, and then this change comes along and exacerbates the problem to new extreme.

The idea of building without consequence completely destroys so much of the strategy and positioning in this game. Couple that with all the items that have been added over the last few months to make people more airborne, and you have a recipe for disaster.

I can't count how many times I was shafted by bad RNG and having to skip some loot and run inside the circle is not funny at all, thanks to the redeploy mechanic I can catch up and use some of that saved time to find loot or harvest some mats. 

Also I like this addition because gliders are no longer limited to just landing, you can enjoy them anywhere now. I like this because I have the Frostwing glider and although it's too loud for my taste, I enjoy using it as many times as I please.

Although I really like this mechanic, I'm not going to deny it has some serious problems, for example now it's really hard to kill someone in a tower with fall damage. As many of you agreed before, the best solution for this problem would be that you need to jump to be able to open the glider.

Frankly now that we have redeployable gliders I feel that if EPIC wants to add storm damage to structures again to prevent sky bases, I wouldn't mind because you would be more likely to die while airborne than dying of fall damage.

(Please no hate.),"Ever since the ""goof"" that happened in Fortnitemares, Many people got a running start to get to the end of the battlepass weeks earlier than normal. I understand that this idea would cost Epic many dollars in revenue, but for all those people that missed out on the 35 tiers, doesn't it seem fair enough to just give 10 more to the people who missed out on the oppertunity? Just a reminder: this is my personal opinion. Please don't be angry. Just an idea I though would help ease some minds.",FortNiteBR

Let's count a few reason:

* You could get a good amount of XP in Disco Domination no matter you've lost or won (900 XP guaranteed no matter you lose or won)
* You could re-spawn, It means you could do as you want, For example, Do your challenges, Have fun and most importantly you had no stress of getting killed
* You could get pretty good loot
* You could focus on combat or dancing or both, You could re-spawn easily
* You could practice and improve your skills, You might say you can do the same in playgrounds but in Disco Domination you were playing against real people and it could be way more better

Not let's see why **Team Terror** is really bad: (At least compared to Disco Domination)

* Bad loot, You get really bad loot and I don't even need to talk about it
* Really low amount of XP, If you go AFK in a solo match you'll get more XP!
* Some players will just spam RPG, Boom Boom and you're dead, Back to lobby
* It's normal squads, Just more players in 1 team + Less XP + Useless monsters (You won't get anything from them but minigun or thermal AR)
* You can't re-spawn, Then all you can and must do is focus on staying alive, It's stressful and you won't be able to be creative because someone might spam RPG and send you back to lobby!

I hope Epic listens and brings back one of the best (If not the best) modes I've ever played, **Disco Domination**.

I know epic is trying to create new modes for us but I think most of the people will agree on this: Disco Domination &gt; Team Terror &gt; Soaring 50's

What do you guys think about this?",FortNiteBR

(No Meds/Shields/Guns),"With the ""Clinger"" sticky explosives coming to the game and with the recent addition of the Port-A-Fort I feel we're due for 1 Utilities/Grenades slot.    

(Default Key = G)    

Currently most usable mid-late game just aren't worth dropping your guns/meds for. Sure there are some instances, but more often than not you'll leave those usables right where you found them unless you have nothin in a slot, which by the way you'll likely replace the minute you find another solid gun or med type for your loadout.    

Items that I feel could be slotted into the Utilities/Grenade would be    

-Grenades    
-Impulse Grenades    
-Remote Explosives (C4)    
-Boogie Bomb    
-Port-A-Fort    
-Clinger (Sticky Nade)

I play on consoles so it might be different with pc players. There is no way they did not implement skilled base or rank base matchmaking in the game. 

Every time I get into top 10 I get killed by someone with 9+ kills. I now also find myself having the most insane build battles. I can’t win a solo now to save my life and I know my stats are going down. I used to win at least 1 out of 5 games play. Now it’s impossible for me to win. I doubt I just woke up one day and couldn’t play.


Sad thing is now I wait till my bad friends get online and I’ll play duos or squads and the game becomes way too easy. I can solo duos if my friend is hosting. But if I’m hosting me and my friends are having a horrible time.

Again I’m not saying I’m the best or I’m getting worst but seriously while I play with my friends I play against people who can’t build well... I feel like I’m the most inconsistent player in the game.

20,CertainlyJB,1524522028,8efi00,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8efi00/idea_expanding_on_the_possible_season_4_option_to/,1,Idea: expanding on the possible Season 4 option to select from several different skins as the tier 100 reward (skill-challenge based skins),"So, [this idea](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8e6b5i/season_4_tier_100_there_should_be_like_5/) was posted the other day. The idea pretty much entails that instead of having the tier 100 reward be 1 skin, there should be several skins that you can choose 1 from, in order to prevent everyone from getting the same skin.

I thought about this, and decided maybe this idea could be expanded on further. What if there were 5 different skins, and each skin entailed 1 challenge in order to obtain it. Each skin would have a challenge of varying difficulty, from extremely easy to extremely hard. You can only choose ONE challenge, and you cannot change your selection after it is made. So, you will only be able to obtain one of the six possible skins.

For example:

Tier 100 skin 1 (extremely easy): get a kill.

Tier 100 skin 2 (easy): win a game

Tier 100 skin 3 (medium): get 10 or more kills in a game.

Tier 100 skin 4 (hard): win 3 consecutive solo games

Tier 100 skin 5 (extremely hard): Win a game with 20 or more kills

Tier 100 failure skin: Skin for those who did not complete their challenge.

You would have 2 weeks to complete the challenge from the time you reach tier 100, even if you hit tier 100 at the end of the season. If you failed to complete your challenge, there would be a “failure” skin so you won’t be left empty handed for reaching tier 100. This way, there would actually be some exclusive skins that required skill to complete, and weren’t as meaningless as John Wick. You wont see any bad players walking around with a skin that requires you to get 20 kills in a game.

What do you guys think of this idea? Let me know! If you would make any changes, feel free to also let me know how you would change it.

Also, those challenges are just examples, not concrete on what the actual challenges would be. The levels of difficulty should be about equivalent to them, though.

Edit: some clarification and grammar fixes.

Personally I think the reason that event was so big was because it was centered around Ninja and Myth, and without them it would have gathered only limited attention and perhaps much more criticism. But that’s just how I see it.

First off, battle royale games are inherently random. Which to the average player, or even at the higher tier levels, doesn’t really matter because there is nothing on the line. You can run around, be flashy and entertaining, and if you get one pumped then hey you can find another game in 30 seconds. But when it comes to events and “pro” players, I can’t think of a scenario more frustrating for them. I mean imagine flying out to a LAN, participating in 3 heats only to get killed off the start or have terrible loot luck and have the entire event be all for nothing. I think this creates an environment too dependent on randomness and luck, which when it comes to eSports is usually limited as much as possible.

Secondly, the gameplay at events is undoubtedly more stale and bland. The thing that sets Fortnite apart from other games is the fact that you can play it how you want and be successful in your own right. Ninja rushes, Myth builds both are successful because they are at the top of their craft. In other eSports, players and skill sets are pigeonholed into one form, where you’re either skilled enough or you aren’t. It seems at the event level of Fortnite, these skills are limited in their effectiveness and usefulness as even Ninja was “camping” at the event. Better players means better shots and strategies, so rushing is all but out the window. Kills become more long range/snipes/splodes which again, decreases the skill ceiling and increases the randomness and luck. 

The last event was the intro to what could be, I understand that. But the principles and playstyles that were showcased will remain, especially if it branches out into Duos/Squads. I think the success was largely based on the entertainer presence and less on the gameplay. What if Ninja doesn’t participate in the eSports scene other than as a personality like he’s mentioned he might do? Will that detract from the viewer base and the success of the eSport? And do you think Fortnite eSports will have success, it’s a large game with amazing potential but that doesn’t always mean it should be played at a pro level.",FortNiteBR

So 3 days ago I took upon the challenge of a fellow redditter when i posted that I can't get to tier 100 if i buy the battle pass with 10 days left in the season. (That was in a post I did to ask if I can make it to 100 in such a short notice since am new).

Now i got it, I got to tier 72 in 3 days, but I am already done with all the challenges and am kind of stuck to how am going to get to tier 100. 

So my question here is, since am just lvl 55, how to get lvl 100 fast since its my only hope to get tier 100 (in addition to week 10 challenges)

Appreciate any help.

And btw if my fellow redditter who said I can't do it, please show up since my old thread was deleted because I didn't flair it or smthn like that :3.",FortNiteBR

Why I want it? Is because I have a bad PC and I'm a PC player, so I would like to play on my XBOX One with my keyboard and mouse, because it has more ""power"" in it.

I know it's a huge advantage against console players, but why not make it that you go to PC lobby? I know that PS4 can detect that you're using mouse and keyboard, so why not drop them into PC lobby.

I know that there will be those ""smart"" people who will go into a game with their controller and then plug the keyboard and mouse.

My point is that I want to know if Fortnite will support keyboard and mouse on XBOX One (if not just going to trade for PS4). (This question has been asked multiple times few months ago)

Whether fortnite implements a systen like H1Z1 where your top 10 games gives you a seasonal rank or (the less likely system) that would be a seperate mode that matches you up with players directly in your skill group. This idea has a couple of issues that go alosg with it however such as long queue times in higher ranks.

The storm moves from the ground upward. Making mountains and high buildings safe havens, you have to constantly be moving up. I believe a slowly moving storm that moves constantly would work, i.e. the storm from 50 v 50 v2 or a storm that moves in intervals, giving a light purple tint over the areas that will soon be covered on your map. 

Now at some point you would need a storm like the normal storm slowly moving in to keep players from building on the opposite sides of the map and just sitting there.

This would have to happen for season 5 now but could the rewards in the battle pass be chosen and once you choose your first one, you set on a path of earning that set of rewards for your chosen side which you represent with the skins.

The best example I could think of was with the dinosaurs. You have Canivores (Rex) vs Herbivores (Tricera Ops). When you buy the battle pass, rather than being given the base season skin, you chose one of two and then the side you havent chose is locked for you. So if i was to pick the herbivore side, I would get the base Herbivore skin and then every tier a new skin is unlocked I get the same style.

I saw people saying they wanted options for the final skin, but this gives them that at the start and then creates a sort of in-game rivalry, essentially red vs blue but with a skin theme rather than colour",FortNiteBR

Dude get there before me, see another 2 already at the motel area.. I couldnt get a gun.  Somehow managed to hide in a bush on the way to the Minecraft looking pickaxe thing with all the rocks.  Go down there, and hear someone hacking away the wood.  Hid behind a rock.  Guy comes running out of where the chest spawns, and immediately gets a rocket in the face from someone.  Guy loots the body and runs off.  Does not see me either.. its like 5 minutes into the game and i still dont have a gun.  Went and picked up what the rocket guy left.  Grenades, a white pistol, bandages and c4.  While i am down there, I hear another chest.  The guy didnt even open the other hidden chest.  open it up.. and got a gold scar.  Circle is closing in on Pleasant, I slowly make my way there picking off stragglers as they come out of the circle.  Made it to circle with 7 people left, and I have Gold Scar, Gold silenced pistol, Blue Tac, a chug jug, and 2 full heals.. a fuckton of mats and 200 health.  I built a base in the first house in the circle. I hear someone else in the same house.  Boom, they dead.. 5 people left, i have 5 kills at this time.  I have to move..  Go to another house that is in the circle.  down to 3 players and one guy is across from my house.. the 2nd guy is building a base on the house i am inside..  I hear the other 2 sniping at each other and i zig zag ramp up the back of my guys tower, jump in and shot gun him in one hit.  Base starts taking rockets.. I rebuild quick and tall but i took a sniper shot so i had to use the chug.. while chugging i see last guy pop 2 insta forts on top of his already impressive base, I get hit again.  Circle moves in my favor, literally my fort is all that is in the circle..   But i built smart.  Every level of my tower, 2 rooms per level, has either a door, or a hole to drop through.  I hear him ramping over and shot his bridge but he was able to jump into the top of my base.  I laid the only trap i had.. It would have never got him, i just wanted him to hear it.  I got to the bottom and started hacking away all the walls.  Some of the walls were out of the circle.. but i just happened to see grenades laying on the ground.  blew the walls.. and dude fell right next to me and popped.  First Victory Royale!

TL:DR - game started bad, no gun, 5 mins.  Ended with 7 kills.  Blew the bottom out of my own base to win.

Edit: - also won 2 other games that night but they were kind of standard.  I did manage to get a 150+ snipe with the purple crossbow though.. somehow.",FortNiteBR

Mouse and Keyboard provides a giant advantage over players using a controller. It is a lot easier to aim using MKB and you can actually flick using it. Not only does MKB naturally provide an aiming advantage, it also allows MKB users to dominate controller users in building battles. Controller users have to switch one box at a time between the buildings, making it a lot slower trying to build fast. But on MKB you can use keybinds to instantly switch from wall to stairs. So MKB can construct bases a lot faster than controller users

Sometimes it feels stupid when you shoot at someone to have them build a 5 storey base in a second that is simply just not possible using a controller.

——————————-MAIN POINT OF POST———————————

I suggest letting console users use MKB. BUT when they do they can only play on PC servers. So now they get to play against other MKBs and it is fair. And us controller users can get a break from getting 2nd each time to a MKB user",FortNiteBR

It is multiple teases EPIC is giving us for the next battle pass. Season 4 will be the time that came after the meteor during the Cretaceous period. 

The meteor is EPIC's way of changing the current map. There will be a massive scar where the meteor actually impacts, water levels will rise, ocean sands will be displaced. Fossils will be scattered around the map. The impact will be so strong that it causes landslides and shifts mountains, knocks down trees. If you played
World of Warcraft, think how Deathwing split the Azeroth. It brings fresh life into the map.

Reward wise in S4 we will have different sorts of skins. The cavemen/neanderthals that have fossils dating back to the origin of archaic humans. The caveman's outfit and a club pickaxe as rewards. They could even include a taunt of your character hitting himself in the head with a club. As the tiers get higher there will be a tribal outfit, tribe mask and outfits. A tribal taunt with drum music that would be perfect to have your squad use around a campfire.

The meteor marks the start of the fourth season's battlepass. The dinosaur skins they have recently included is also a hint as to what's to come after it hits.

This is EPIC's way of changing the old map, in a way that creates a sort of story. It also creates a theme for a whole season.

some of you may be thinking ""*huh?*""
yes, it is unfair and in some ways... unbalanced.

&amp;nbsp;

If you're attacking with a right-side view via cover, You have the advantage over another player attacking with a left-side view due to the way the third person camera works (currently)


&amp;nbsp;

Let me show you what i mean.

**(Right side camera view)**

https://i.imgur.com/bf6lgAp.gifv

**(Left side camera view)**

https://i.imgur.com/0DR3W1E.gifv

&amp;nbsp;
As you can see, if you're attacking with a right-side view, you can take shots without risking too much of your hitbox so less risk for you while from the other side (Left-side view) you have to walk out of cover and reveal your full hitbox on show basically putting you at a big disadvantage.

&amp;nbsp;

**So how would you fix this?**

Implementing a camera/sholder switch button.

Having the ability to switch shoulders will allow you to switch on the move and not be at a disadvantage if you're attacking with a left-side view as you can just switch camera/shoulders

&amp;nbsp;

Here is an example from a game called APB:Reloaded.



**Shoulder Switching**

If you take the concept that APB:Reloaded has used (and other titles) and implement it into FortniteBR it will help the combat become more fluid and fair (in my opinion)

As a fairly new player to Fortnite (120~ matches) who's loving the game after coming from BUG P (PUBG), I would like to know from other player's experience how often they see this.

Yesterday I played some matches and no kidding, I found three different duos on SOLO mode which totally destroyed everyone in the match. Unfortunately I forgot to record video for one of them, but I did get the other two on record and reported them to the Fortnite team on their website.

I find it weird how people rarely ever mention this issue, considering how surprisingly often it happens and I am actually constantly questioning myself when there are only 3 or 4 players left, ""are they teaming up? Why isn't no one killing each other?"" It's almost like a trauma or something lol

Anyway just wanted to get this off my chest. It's frustrating to lose to a duo on Solo, and the community seems to hate people who camp on bushes more than people who team up to get an advantage over other players. Just wanted to know your thoughts on the matter, how often you see these, if you reported anyone and if it worked, etc.

I ended up solving it myself and got her account linked so she can play her account on her iPhone and PC. Several weeks later, today, Epic Games emailed me this:

I don't want to break the news to my girlfriend that I somehow screwed up her account. She loves this game and community so much. This seems unusually cruel and unfair when she has done nothing and all I tried to do was help. Can anybody help?

Edit: We don't account share. It was an idea and I responsibly emailed Epic Games AHEAD of time to ask them about this. They are assuming we account share because I said her account is on my ps4. Of course it is, we live together and she owns no consoles. I've played maybe &lt;10 games on my own pc account.",FortNiteBR

The amount of skills and instincts required to win the a game is incredible, I've had countless great times with my friends in this game.

 That is until a week ago when they bought the Save The World edition. That's when they turned their back on me basically, Any attempts to contact them asking for a game of Battle Royale turned down because they were having a blast in Save the World. Not to be cliche, but I've never felt so alone. I looked up gameplay for it and it does certainly seem like a blast. I want to play it and delve into the story and lore of the base game, Battle Royale just seems like the surface of a much bigger game that's overshadowed by the Battle Royale mode.

And with that, I'll get to the point, if there is any kind soul that is able to gift me a copy of this game, I'll love you forever and we'll play together side by side!

Why don’t Epic implement an ammo cap on rockets and make the respective weapons consumable. 8 rockets for RPGs, 12 rocket ammo for grenade launchers. Once this ammo has been depleted, the weapon will just disappear from your inventory similar to that of a shield potion once you’ve used it. 
This will stop players just hoarding rockets until the final circle and unleashing “Kim Jong Un” furious hell upon you.

When I finnally got it working the day after the skin wasn't it the shop anymore. That really annoyed me because I worked hard for it and in the end couldn't buy it.
This is why I think this is good idea.
Basically the way it would work is there would be an extra tab in the game, called shop or something like that. When you click on it you have to select what platform you play on and what your IGN (In game name) is. Then you will see pictures of different skins and pickaxes that you can buy. When you select one it just comes up with a generic checkout, you know.
For prices you can either do how much the vbucks would cost or ho much the skin is worth.

I've posted this a couple of times now so some of you might have already seen it. I'm reposting this because those are bugs that make the gameplay on console feel clunky and less enjoyable, especially the first one that I explain in depth. Furthermore Epic has not listed these bugs on their Trello so they are very likey not aware of them. Hopefully this gets their attention.*


**Bug/ Issue**

Since the addition of builder pro i noticed many inconsistencies regarding building on console.
What happened is that i tried to block some shots by placing down walls. For some reason it didn't do so and i ended up catching those bullets with my face even though i pressed circle and held down R2. 
It actually happens pretty frequently to me, also with other building pieces too. What happens there, is that when i want to select another building piece, the first button press wont't register and it wouldn't let me switch to the building piece i want, i would have to press that button another time to make it work.

Since this is quite an annoying bug and makes the gameplay feel clunky I tried to replicate this and found out that it is really easy to replicate:

**Replication on PS4**

 - Press Circle to enter build mode
 - Press or Hold R2 *immediately/ as fast as possible* after pressing circle 

Normally you should have placed a Wall, but you did not.

*The same goes with selecting/placing other building pieces:*

- Press Circle to enter build mode 
- Press L2 *immediately or as fast as possible* after pressing circle 
- Press L2 again 

Normally you should've now built a set of stairs, which is not the case If you've done the first two steps correctly/ fast enough. Instead you still have walls selected at step 2 and stairs selected at step 3. Thus you would have to add another step to actually place your set of stairs, which should already have been the case in step 3.

**Noticable things while doing these steps**

After doing those steps to replicate the bug over and over again i noticed a couple of things: 

 - if I want to place down a wall, my gun would shoot even after pressing circle. 

 - if I want to select/ place down stairs with L2 (after pressing circle)  sometimes my Screen would zoom in and out quickly  as if I was aiming down sights.

 - if i want to select a floor with R1, the game still registers it as swapping weapons as you can still see that selection slot moving to the right while the selection bar in the HUD gets smaller in order to make space for the build-menu.

**Conclusion/ Explanation**
 
I'm pretty sure you already saw that there is some kind of pattern behind this, but before
I jump to the conclusion I'd like to explain some terms that I'll use to illustrate the problem: 

 - **Build mode**: All the things you do after pressing circle, pretty self-explanatory

 - **Combat mode**: Things you do outside of build mode, for example ads, shooting, switching weapons.

So basically after you press CIRCLE to enter **build mode** there is a *really, really* short delay where your actions are still executed in **combat mode**. 

This also goes hand in hand with an already known issue of the builder pro layout that i'll list at the end of this post: 

 - *selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting*

This problem can be explained with the conclusion that i just made. 
What's causing you to stop sprinting is that you've pressed L2 (which is ADS in **combat-mode**) in that specific time window where your actions are still executed in **Combat mode**. Thus you were aiming down sights for a really short amount of time which was enough to stop your character from sprinting.

Actually looking back at this, maybe this isn't just a builder pro issue. It could be possible that this problem transfers to the other Control schemes, too. 

**Other (known/ new) issues**

So I think we are all aware of the current bugs/issues that the new Builder Pro layout comes with: 

- Selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting. 

- Full-auto weapons will stop firing  when aiming down sights while firing. (Already in their Trello

- **NEW**: Spamming the button to select/place traps will sometimes result in changing your traps instead of placing them. Unfortunately i don't know how to replicate this bug yet. But i'll look into it.


Finally, i would really appreciate it if you upvote to get this post some attention, so the devs can see it and look into it. 
(I really don't care about internet points, but i do care about bugs getting fixed to guarantee a better experience for everyone.)

Anyways thanks for reading and I'm sorry if anything of this is hard to understand because English isn't my native language heh.

TL;DR is at the end of the post. Main reasons to uninstall:

- Too much RNG based game, not enough skill based like all competitive games should be based on. Get the best weapon at start due RNG thing and you're most likely to win.

- Building process is sometimes buggy, sometimes when ambushed you want to put a wall up, you click like crazy on a flat terrain and the wall would just not build, in the meantime, you get killed because of that.

- Rocket launchers are too powerful and do not inflict team of self damage. Players that come in luck with RNG and get the rocket launchers can just blast you up with spamming rockets at close range. You get killed and they don't suffer any damage from their own rockets. Sure, you can build if you're not faced with a build bug and counter the rockets, but that's usually only effective when you're 1 vs 1 and longer range than CQB. Close range, duos or squad you get rekt by rockets almost everytime. I accept that, what I don't accept is no self or team damage from your own rocket.

- Feels like cheating when you can see a player from above and he can't see you (3rd person thing)

Fix this and I'm willing to play and also support the game again. Games should be a joy to play, to relax, not to be frustrated by them. I don't mind being killed by a more skilled player, I mind being killed by pure luck, mostly attributed to RNG and bugs. I'll check back in a few months to see if any changes were being made, If not, I'll just play other games. It just feels bad, because this game has a huge potential. And I know some salty people will comment ""noob"", ""learn to play"", ""buildddddd"", ""get rekt"", ""counter rockets"" and many other useless, counter productive comments. What I'd like to see is your view (not in a salty way) about my issues with the game and what are other issues you get most annoyed by other than some random kids shouting ""rocket ride, please, rocket ride"".

3) Do I aim for the head or body.

4) Common sense when I say rarity needs to be considered.

If you are warmed up, and don’t get nervous when your in final moments of the games engagements, by all means take the Pump. If you get nervous and prefer to stay with the Low Risk option, take the Tac

Above all my recommendation is to drop one or both of your shotguns for a heavy (any rarity) as the heavy shotgun is dominant over both.

Any additional information would be greatly appreciated.",FortNiteBR

On Xbox there are multiple users streaming themselves going into games at which they freeze/lag everyone on the Battle Bus island which after a few minutes results in everyone getting kicked meaning they get the win. I've also been in a game when this has happened at which your game restarts.

If you want proof of this just watch a guy on xbox under the gamertag 'judp', he is streaming himself doing it right now - also have in mind this glitch isn't 100% consistant and I've seen him not been able to kick everyone but the majority.

Soooo, I’ve been grinding the game extremely hard and have abt 600 wins. I haven’t played a single other game since i downloaded fortnite.

Ever since they’ve added weapon swap delay, first shot accuracy and damage drop-off, I have not been enjoying the game at all. The skill gap HAS been significantly diminished and I find myself dying to BS every other game. I think I’m going to quit playing the game until they revert the weapon swap delay or add an update that creates some more skill gap because every time I play, I end up getting so angry that I just have to quit. The pace of play has seemed to slow to a crawl and all anyone wants to do is sit in 1 by 1s and AR spam me from the mountain that they positioned themselves on at the beginning of the game. People play like complete pansies and when you do have a shotgun fight it feels absolutely terrible. Absolutely hate these new updates and it seems like most everyone else does.

 Like, maybe if you hover over someone’s name on the “Epic Friends” tab you would be able to push a button that would say “Request Trade.” 

 After you click that, it would pull up a screen showing both your skins and the player your interested to trade with skins. And you would be able click a button on your controller or mouse that would be able to select the skins you would want to trade and what you want in return from the other player.

 And maybe not just skins. Maybe do the same with Harvesting Tools, Gliders, contrails, loading screens and dances/emotes.

I thinks this would be really cool because like me I am really trying to get the skull trooper skin because I started around December wasnt  here for the release of the skin. There is many people on social media trading account but that is fishy and easily could be scammed for my whole account and I don’t want to trade all my skins for it because I have a lot. By adding the feature of trading bar you would not have to worry about being scammed and losing your account.

  And if you don’t want to get trades there could be a tab that says “Turn trade requests off/on” and you would be able to choose on or off.

  Also, maybe if your friend can not afford a skin, or dosent want to spend money on the game you could give them skins that you don’t use anymore like skins from the battle pass. Also if you are a YouTube it would be so much easier to do giveaways for skins.

 That is why I think a trading feature in Fortnite Battle Royale would dope. Reply on what you think and make sure to thumbs up or thumbs down if you like the idea or don’t.",FortNiteBR

Every update the game feels slightly different.  I pride myself in figuring it out as i try to adjust to the new nuances of the game.

After the last big update ive had the hardest time figuring out all the changes and why the game felt so different and why i was playing so much worse save for the random hot streaks here and there Im no ninja but up until the last update i won atleast once every hour

From what Ive gathered it seems my opponents seem to be better all around from their skins to how they play, fight, build loot, and move around strategically

With so many gaming companies being so short sighted that they manipulate games to force equality of outcome in order to keep low performing players playing to drive microtransactions did fortnite finally follow that trend?  (Streetfighter, Any EA game, Gears of War) They wanted to implement it a few months ago but were met with huge outcry.  That might only stop them from implementing it publicly.

Am i crazy and a sore loser or does anyone else share my experiences/thoughts?

Tl:DR Last update feels like they secretly put in skill based matchmaking, im probably wrong but if they did that goes against the spirit of the game and would a very dishonest move from a company that has previously had such great communication",FortNiteBR

  The ambush happened soon after. 4 guys rushed me, and I knocked one but weakened the others. They knocked me. Then you came in, with a fucking rocket launcher. (Did you use a vending machine?) You literally killed all those kids. Just as I was about to die, you came and revived me. I was convinced that we cleared all of Tilted, but one remained. He got me, but you killed him. And then you revived me. Again. Throughout all this excitement, the storm was closing in. 
  I checked the map, and I think you did as well, and I looked at you. You looked at me. I got a good glimpse of the goddess (god?) you were. All of a sudden, you built a stair and two platforms. I saw in your hands, the rocket launcher. I knew what was about to happen. 
  I jumped, and I rode my way out of the storm. You weren’t lucky. When I got off and in to the circle, I desperately searched for a launchpad, and the hope I could save you. If you die, I die with you. 
  I couldn’t save you. I’m sorry. I failed you, Elite Agent. And in your description it states “Failure is not an option”, it was in this case. You saved me three times. The only thing I did was just down someone. 
  With your help, we went on to win the game. But, the sweet “Victory Royale!” wasn’t enough to fill the hole in my heart. 

  Elite Agent, wherever you are, thank you. I love you dearly. May you get more Victory Royales in the future, or at least, help others get them. 

  Elite Agent, my friend, my ally, my rescuer, my 8 minute companion. Goodbye.

1- Just remove the air drops. It ends up being a group of 10 members of the same team shooting each other down. Looks ridiculous and isn't fun. There's gotta be another way to distribute loot.  I just ignore them because what's the point.  

2- Increase loot even more on the ground or have more vending machines. But make the circle move in quicker. A lot of players spend so much time on the outer rims collecting loot that a good chunk of the teams are down by the time everyone is actually in the circle.  

*Probably because if you're closer, you get harassed by your own team when trying to open chests.  One guy on my team just boogie bombed me so he could open the chest before I did. To get a measly grey AR.  

3- Remove team members being able to shoot each other's builds down.  Can't tell you how many times I went to use a launch pad and someone shot me down to take my loot before I even got to put the pad down. 

4-. Add some sort of reward system for revives. But limit it so it can't be abused. There's no reason to revive a team mate now unless your just a decent/nice player.  

If anyone else has anything to add on feel free to contribute. I just feel like all these things going on are detrimental to the game. Even if there's gonna be more modes beyond 50v50 these things should be considered for those as well.

I would do it myself but do not have the time currently because of college classes... As of right now, I wouldn't be able to pay you \(I would Love to\), this will be a long term partnership that when I have the means to pay you I will \(if the stream keeps growing, YouTube channel grows, get donations and add revenue, etc!\). I think this would be an awesome way to meet you guys with such skills and help grow the channel tremendously!

If you are looking for experience with video editing or want to help out please comment below or message me privately! I value all of your times for reading this and I know there's no incentive money wise! But I would of course give you full credit for editing my videos on my YouTube!

Thank you so much again for even taking a look at this and I hope to be in contact with you soon!

Other times his teammates' aren't nearby and thirsting is a quick way to loot him and leave. 

BUT, far too many times I've had this stupid situation in duos/squads. My team gets in a fight. My teammate goes down, and I down one of their teammates. The score is even at this point. I have one of your teammates down on me, you have one of mine on you. And then someone, usually a pleb in a Rust Lord skin, sprints over to finish off my teammate instead of finishing the fight with me.

Here is my argument: You finishing my teammate just means I am going to finish yours.

I think the sound engineering in Fortnite is pretty garbage compared to other games. 

There is some spatial audio going on where you can kinda discern things like footsteps but have you noticed how faint something like footsteps above you are compared to below you, or to the left or to the right?

The distinction between footsteps above you and outside are really minimal even though footsteps above you should be very obvious. Good luck discerning between footsteps in the room next to you vs. footsteps that are downstairs.

I really hope Fortnite can spend some time on this as it'll improve the game quite a bit for everyone.

So what I'm suggesting is that there should always be a 50v50 gamemode, maybe even a gamemode with respawning, to give players a more casual, laid back mode to enjoy with their friends. Just my 50 cents, hope you're having a good day. ",FortNiteBR

Do you remember the last time you didn't get killed by a shotgun? Or the other way round, how often do you kill people with shotguns?
I am sick,frustrated and bored of them because their concept even when effective most of the time is anti-fun.
 
Who enjoys getting 1 pumped without a chance to fight back? Hitting the enemy for a mere 7-15 damage when you were sure you hit?

SMG's offer high dps too but the damage isn't instant like with shotguns which make them sub-optimal to use if the enemy is capable of handling a gun. Most of the other close range weapons are not even worth talking about which is sad because there is such a big variety and if you want to win the only time you take these weapons is to challenge yourself which is a nice thing to do to change things up once in a while.

But how can we change shotguns so they are still viable while being toned down? I don't have an answer for that either except ideas which lead to dead ends in terms of balancing.

But what do you think of the suggestion of taking shotguns completely out of the game for a while and see how players try to create a new way to fight in close quarters and strive away from the staleness of double pump.

I cant group up with other people because they  wont let me join them when I say something like ""Hey im new to the game, yeah i haven't gotten any wins- Oh okay I was immediately kicked out?"" And so far thats the whole appeal of the game, its the old ""Your not good, don't play with us loser."" Like wtf? Even league acknowledges skill based on the information YOU know as a player and not based on random chances. And there are SO many guides, forums, 1:1 examples of how to counter something or even how to handle a certain situation. But for this game, the skill goes right out the window and no one wants to teach anyone because they would rather keep the knowledge to themselves. its almost like when the old doom players would not want to show off the tips and tricks for everyone and thus we now never know any from them.

And it feels like me and others are in a loop of losing, like we/im are never going to get any better at this game or cant join with anyone to TEACH me/us the skills to get better. And thats just straight up bullshit, like Id love to teach someone how to play this game if only i knew myself. Its like there are no friendly people to show me the way of how I can win and maybe in the process develop my own way of how i like to play. All if not most social aspects boil down to: ""MUST BE NINJA/GOD THE GAME WITH KD OF 1000.00 AND 5000 WINS AND IN THE TOP 10 PLAYERS."" Thats just fucking dumb and alienates the people who just want to play for fun and maybe learn the game mechanics.

so what im saying is, this game isnt right for me and its just feels like a waste of my time and to a extent others time because i lack the ""skill"" in this RNG based Battle royal game.

Have 2 playlists, casual and competitive.. put the pump shotgun in the competitive playlist and keep it out of the casual playlist. Reason being it's simply giving amazing players capable of head shot locking an instant one hit kill with no way to counter it if you are below the skill gap of that player. Fair play to those players, I bow my head to you as I will never be able to head shot lock as fast as you guys.

I do ok for a casual, 2+ K/D and 6% win rate, garbage compared to the godly players I know but I'm happy with it and have I think around 90ish wins... so I'm not asking for epic to hand us wins or anything, I'm fine how it is.. but that pump... in my hands I land a good shot and it does bugger all damage, my opponent one shots me with full 200 health :(

If I switch the game off it's mainly because of this, honestly I am probably not the only one, if they keep the pump as it is then potentially more and more people will just switch off which is a shame. It's a fun casual game. I'm now starting to play this game less mainly because of constant deaths to one bloody gun.

So my suggestion, don't nerf these things, for the people loving the pump give them a competitive playlist and for us casuals give us a playlist that this beastly gun doesn't wreck

Why it’s the best:
• He is the mascot for the pizza restaurant in Tomato Town. (who wouldn’t love the skin?)
• The pizza delivery back bling is phenomenal to me. 
• He is obviously delivering pizzas in the middle of a 100 man fight. (dedicated pizza delivery boy)

The Questions:
• How did the mascot get there? How did he get involved in the battle royale?
• Where are the pizzas headed to? There are 2-3 pizzas in the back bling. 
• Will the pizzas ever be delivered?

Conclusion:
• Tomato Head is obviously the best skin in Fortnite. He’s literally a pizza delivery boy that’s dedicated to deliver the pizzas. He’s on the way to make sure the pizzas get delivered &amp; on the way to that, he is caught in a 100 man battle royale. He is willing to risk dying to deliver those pizzas. He is a hero in my eyes. 

EDIT: What kind of pizzas are in the bag? Only a question EPIC could answer.

Whenever I try to run the app I get an error saying “OpenGL not supported” and that I needed something called “Metal.” Does anyone know how to fix this or a work around? I’d really love to play on it. ,FortNiteBR

God even the thought of mentioning of saying that there is someone in this world better than ninja will get you a barrage of downvotes which is ridiculous lol. I personally don’t like him he’s very cringy for me but he appeals more to the kids, he’s a great PUBS player but there are a lot of people better than him. Also keep in mind that he literally plays a lot of mobile players or just clueless pc players. Everyone can have their own opinion on crinja y’all kids got to stop down voting people because they have a different view on your favorite STREAMER than you ! ",FortNiteBR

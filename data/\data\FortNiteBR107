They look a lot more sleek and graceful in game, meanwhile males are kinda clunky. I also feel like most female skins are better designed than their male counterparts imo.

And finally, it’s because I am a female, and would prefer to play as one. There are exceptions (Rogue Agent, Zenith, and First Strike Specialist are males I like)

From the [nomination thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ahgtay/rfortnitebr_1_million_subscriber_celebration/eeeg65z/):

When it comes to being an elite builder Pencils of Promise has serious building skills, and schools kids everyday like we all wish we could. Seriously, this charity builds schools in places like Ghana, Guatemala and Laos and allows kids to get education.

### [Here is the link to our CrowdRise donation page!](https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/fortnitebr1million)

### Mods vs. Community Event

We had issues overall yesterday, but we've smoothed things out for Day 2. If you haven't already, join the [/r/FortniteBR discord](https://discord.gg/FortniteBR) and follow the server rules to assign yourself the Player role, then watch for pings in the NA/EU 1 million lobby channels to know when to join matches. Priority in matches goes to new players, but returning players may join if there are vacancies. You can only win a main prize one time, and a second, smaller prize for a second victory. No prizes will be awarded for winning more than twice.

The maps will be free-for-all maps, with winners decided by most eliminations. Tiebreaker can be determined by a 1v1 in a smaller map if necessary. 

Listen to the host. Don't talk over them, don't prematurely start a mini game. We had issues with that yesterday and will forfeit prizes if it happens again today. 

**Once you are in the VC:** Wait for the host to tell you you may join, and then **join their creative server.** Do not join their party. The host must enter the Creative Hub solo. 

After the game, leave the VC so the mods can prepare for the next match and send out a ping. Any questions can be directed to the host, or the mods who are around in support. Utilize the discussion channels and the !event command if necessary. Do not ping Discord staff unless it is urgent.

We will have two lobby VCs: NA and EU.

Game prize winners will be contacted early this week.

### Prizes

We have Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins for the games. SteelSeries has also returned to donate prizes for charity donations!

### Prize Breakdown

**For Games**

Epic-themed prizes: 15 swag packs, each containing a hat, shirt, and a pin

Reddit Coins: Silver, Gold, and Platinum

**For Charity**

SteelSeries: 3 packs containing [Arctis 5](https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-5), [Rival 310](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-310), [QcK+](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-plus-limited), [M750 TKL](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-m750-tkl)

[Delivery restrictions for SteelSeries](https://imgur.com/a/8vdwkSP)

### How to Win

The Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins will be awarded for the Mods vs. Community games.

For **every $1 USD** donated to our Pencils of Promise charity drive between now and 2/1, 12:00am EST, you will receive 1 entry into the drawing. The drawing will be recorded and posted with the winners approximately 1 week after the charity drive ends. We will be reaching out to the winners no later than February 15th, and they must confirm response within 48 hours of being contacted or the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Contact will be made through the email provided when donating to the charity drive. All 3 SteelSeries prize packs will be in this drawing.

*You may only win a donated prize one time. In the event a winner is chosen and they do not meet the delivery requirements of a prize they won, we will first work with them to attempt to have the prize shipped to a valid delivery address. We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option. Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.*

It was the game's 1 year anniversary, and there was a giant crack in the sky. It was the Cube's prime time, as it was spawned in Season 5.

Some of us have embarrassing names or just want to advertise channels to grow. 

If the main reason that is holding Epic back from doing this is the Xbox/PlayStation policies for reporting a user if they harass you/break a rule, just make a ""view profile"" button when you look at the menu to see who is on your team. I do not understand why it cannot already be done considering they already allow streamer mode on console, which lets you hide your username!

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I want to start a YouTube channel- but I do not want to keep my embarrassing username. I also do not want to pay 10 dollars to change it, considering PC players get it free. Please, consider this suggestion. I am almost positive that I am supported by the majority of console players.",FortNiteBR

I hear the argument, “you can just change your Epic name.” But at least do it to the console player. We are stuck with the name we chose earlier.

At some times the game is borderline unplayable because of the massive fps drops. The issue is not that the game on console is capped at 60 frames per second, but it’s that the game nowadays can barely manage to maintain that 60 fps. 
We are now in season 7 of Fortnite and console still has not gotten an option to tweak graphical settings nor the option to change the resolution in in-game settings. Console players can probably never keep up with the PC players, but it would be good if Epic Games could optimize Fortnite on console so the game could run at it’s fullest potential.

But why? Back in the days I’d log into Fortnite and it felt like a realy special game. I was also so hyped about my first skin and emote. I guess I will list up a few thing that ruined Fortnite a little bit.

• Transportation: Yeah, so many people wanted new ways to Transportation and when we first got it we got hyped,  even with just a shopping cart. Now, it just ruins the Point of the storm almost. We have so much to get away with. It was usualy just a launch pad that would help. 

• Too much weapons: Now, this might be a weird one but honestly, we have too much. We dont realy need more than 2 types of AR’s and 3 types of shotguns. And why, just Why is there so many SMG’s? We never asked for it

• SMG’s: Just as season 4 started people started with the spray and pray meta and in season 5 people started using SMG’s. Epic added 2 SMG’s in just 4 weeks. SMG’s got way to overpowered and it almost ruined the Point of having a shotgun

• The Tryhards(Dont take this seriously as it has nothing with Epic to do) : 
While this dont count for everyone, I gotta say with all these tryhards it kinda ruins the charm of the game a little bit. In season 4 when TFue got more popular people looked up to three people, Ninja, Tfue and Myth. They would say to their friend they are better than those streamers. Now, 25% of the lobby is tryhards. It has even gone to the point that you cant even dance to people in a building if you dont have loot.

If you read all that, thank you for taking your time. Also, let’s get a list in the comments of other things",FortNiteBR

2-Laser Gun-SMG alike gun with slower fire rate and less damage,but infinite ammo,I guess only useful in early game-Rarity Uncommon and Rare

3-Awm or Awp(basically Bolt Action) with advanced scope,unlike other snipers this gun uses higher scope,longer range,to make it intersting there should be only Legendary variant

4-Flame thrower-Throws spray of flame only on close to medium range,the closer you are,the more damage,and it leaves you burning for couple of seconds doing bleeding damage,just like smoke grenades,Epic and Legendary variants

5-Uzi-Supressed or not-pistol like Smg,they removed like 5 SMG’s(LMG,tommy gun,tactical smg,original SMG,supressed SMG)so it is time to bring one back,Common,uncommon and rare,and maybe Epic variant of this gun

I think there should be a test with zero bloom on weapons and no items that build for you or break the skill barrier within the game I.E boomboxes.. i think glider redeploy is fine as an item and believe Epic took the right step into pleasing everyone with it being an item and not a game mechanic. But whats really hurting the game is bloom, ridiculous server shot registrations (have you ever shot someone with a pump in the head from two feet away and see that the shot hit but no damage actually happened) and the fact that they went from making the game fun to pleasing casuals.. what made this game so popular was everyone competing to be a great builder and watching streamers so we can learn from them on how to be better... i know casuals bring a decent amount of money because not everyone wants to be a lro but they should bring back double pump (unpopular opinion) remove any item that builds for you.. and get rid of the boombox it really kills the fun in the game theres probably a few things i missed but that would be a great start haha let me know what you guys think :)",FortNiteBR

I know I've been rambling, so I'll get to the point. What is it that makes you like this game? do you legitimately like the gameplay? is it the developer? is it because it's free and you can't afford new games? is it because it's popular?

 I've been trying to make sense of this trend for a while, and whenever I ask someone IRL, I just get the common, ""It's a gud game for people who aren't lame"", ""Sorry, I don't speak nerd"", etc responses.

While I may not agree with your opinion/taste in games, I would simply like to know your thought process. If you can give me an answer, it would be greatly appreciated. do not take this as me trying to hate on/make fun of your hobby, but simply trying to get a glimpse into your world.

I hope I didn't go on for too long, and hope you get a lot of future... ""Wins?"", ""Victory Royales?"", I don't know

-Planes- The reason why is because people can camp in the air the whole game and get in the top 10 without any effort.

-Boom Boxes and Dynamite- They should remove the items because a lot of people can destroy build battles and small buildings very easily and get easy kills.

-Turrets- Turrets should be removed because they can be very annoying when trying to build against it then get destroyed because of somebody with a spammy item.

-Fog- I can barely see or hit my shots when the whole map is filled with fog.

-Redeploy Item- I think it should get removed so people can't just get out of fights easily.

-Explosives- I feel like they should remove all the epic and rare explosives and only find legendary versions in supply drops.

Things that Should be Added back...

-Double Pump- I think since a lot of players are smarter now and can learn things themselves then I feel like we would all be able to learn how to use Double Pump if its added back.

-Drum Gun- Even though this gun can be very spammy I think It should be added back because it was overall a really fun gun to use.

-Tac SMG- This was probably one of my favorite SMG besides Drum Gun and it should be nerfed a tiny bit.

-Rare Scars- They should make it so Assault Rifles that are Epic and Legendary should have a lower spawn rate on ground and on chests like how it was in Season 2.

I don’t get it, how hard is it to just make it a separate mode? this is insane. all the backlash from the community and top streamers and you still don’t give a shit. it’s a shame really, when I first started playing back in march, your player base took pride in how you listen to the community’s opinion. now it just seems that you’ve made all the money in the world and you just don’t care about how we feel about the game.",FortNiteBR

Issues/requests regarding cosmetics:

1. Max Ragnarok armor interferes with sight when aiming down sights.
2. Lynx's ponytail looks ugly. Add an option to remove it please?
3. Omega pickaxe should be able to change color, like Lynx's, and, before anyone says ""they want to make money so players will buy pickaxes to go with omega"", keep in mind that A) Lynx's pickaxe changes color, and B) Epic is worth over a MILLION dollars.
4. Add an option to make a ""set"" with cosmetics, so players wouldn't have to change out picks/gliders/backblings whenever we switch to a different skin.

Suggestions for smoother gameplay:

1. Push to edit; release to confirm.
2. Hold to toggle the minimap.
3. Hold to crouch.

Other Suggestions:

1. Put boomboxes underneath the ""traps"" category.
2. bring the revolver back as common, uncommon, and rare variants of the Hand Cannon.

Best,

**Least Controversial**

- Damage to planes should reduce their mobility.
Imo a good solution to the problems of planes.

- Chug jugs should be have 2 uses of 100 health/shield that take slightly longer than medkits to use.
Usually players won’t carry chug jugs (unless in squads), so this would just make them more viable in solos/duos. I’ve seen posts about chug jugs all over the internet, so I have no idea who came up with the idea of changing them first, but the 2 use 100 hp is something I had the idea of.

- Presents should stay in the game.
I’m assuming presents are going to be removed by the end of season 7 because they’re Christmas themed, but I think if they would only drop non-explosive guns, presents would be a fine item. They’re a fun way to trap people too.

- Players should be able to turn boomboxes off and on.
Stay near it and hold interact for maybe 1 or 2 seconds. However, they can be re-enabled too, so watch out.

- Grenades should make a noise within 1 second of exploding.
From my understanding they’re supposed to be stealthy, but when they soar through the air and don’t bounce once it’s literally impossible for you react.

- Players should be able to carry at most 6 rockets.
This may seem like too little in squads but don’t forget that your teammates can carry extra rockets for you. This would also encourage players to use rockets strategically rather than spam.

(I’m was not sure if this one would be a good edition but I put it in here anyway.)
- Horizontal bounce pads from Creative should be added to BR.
The speed should not be insanely good, and shouldn’t be changeable. It has nice mobility, but would make skirmishes less entertaining to watch because rotating would need less of the skill of tunneling.

- The Guided Missile should be unvaulted.
The speed should be much faster and it should have unlimited duration, but it should only do 30 damage to players and maybe a grenade’s worth of explosive damage. This would make it more focused on scouting and rocket riding rather than attacking players.

- All pistols should have extremely good accuracy when jumping, when strafing, and when hip firing.
It’s already more difficult to aim when clicking 7 times a second, and furthermore  
pistols only do 23 - 26 damage. I understand it’s a low tier weapon, but it shouldn’t be completely useless.

- All pumps variants should decrease by 5 damage.
This is just for consistency. Usually a re-skin of guns means significantly better — scars can 3 shot but regular ARs can’t, suppressed pistols can 4 shot but regular pistols cant. This would allow SPASs to one tap while pumps can’t.

- Hitting one shotgun pellet should not be as powerful has hitting 3.
I’m tired of people blaming 7 damage shots on the game, rather than their aim. I understand that ping can factor in to this, but tripling your shotgun’s damage for a lackluster shot is far from a good way to solve this. Maybe everyone forgot that in season 5 all shotguns became 100% consistent.

- Tactical shotguns should have a 2.25x headshot multiplier.
The gun is just not very rewarding compared to pumps. Most players drop a blue tactical over a green pump, and to be honest most would still do that after this change, but I believe that tacs and pumps shouldn’t have a massive difference in viability.

- The Double Barreled should be unvaulted.
It should be buffed to 130/135 damage. It was a great, balanced gun that players failed to see the potential of. Maybe make shotguns do only 50% damage to builds to balance it a bit, because during ~~the era of spraying~~ season 5 its biggest problem was being able to break through fully built wood with one shot.

- Hand Cannons should not deal 150 damage to builds.
If we’re being honest here, other than actually shooting enemies, the gun takes 0 skill to use. If you think breaking builds with one shot is a fun way to play the game we already have the heavy sniper. It’s much more balanced because it can’t spam 7 shots and reload practically instantly. Ok, not instantly, but unlike snipers, double barreled shotguns, and explosives, you’ll have a very good chance of having a time to reload hand cannons mid fight. I’m pretty sure this buff to the hand cannon during Fortnitemares was to counter turtling, but don’t forget we have stink bombs.

### Mods vs. Community Event

Using community-created maps from our sister sub /r/FortniteCreative, we will pit the /r/FortniteBR subscribers against the moderators on January 26th and 27th in Creative Mode. Starting at noon EST on both days, we’ll use the [/r/FortniteBR discord](https://discord.gg/FortniteBR) to coordinate matches. Users will compete against the mods on team deathmatch or free-for-all maps, and we’ll rotate users in and out along with participating mods. 

###Dates

January 26th and 27th

### Times

Starting at noon EST, with end time around 3 or 4 PM EST each day.

### Servers

We will have two lobby VCs: NA and EU

### How it Works

### How to Win

The Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins will be selected from a pool of users who participate in Mods vs. Community matches over the weekend, as well as the winners of those matches. 

For every $1 USD donated to our Pencils of Promise charity drive between now and 2/1, 12:00am EST, you will receive 1 entry into the drawing. The drawing will be recorded and posted with the winners approximately 1 week after the charity drive ends. We will be reaching out to the winners no later than February 15th, and they must confirm response within 48 hours of being contacted or the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Contact will be made through the email provided when donating to the charity drive. All 3 SteelSeries prize packs will be in this drawing.
You may only win a donated prize one time. In the event a winner is chosen and they do not meet the delivery requirements of a prize they won, we will first work with them to attempt to have the prize shipped to a valid delivery address. We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option. Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.

360,matheusamr,1548520548,ak2dkj,90,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ak2dkj/zombies_psychology_and_you/,1,"Zombies, Psychology and You","Hello everyone,

Other than a Fortnite enthusiast, in my everyday life I'm also a Psychologist. More specifically, I'm a Gestalt-Therapist. I study this kind of therapy since 2012 and I've been practicing it since 2015. 

When I play videogames, I end up automatically ""analyzing"" them. I will notice how some aspects of gameplay will interact with the player and how that affects his experience. 

I should say: it amazes me how well made Fortnite is, psychologically speaking. It's not a coincidence it's so addicting, fun and interesting. The game is well ""tuned"" with multiple aspects of human excitement. 

Fortnite thrives on survival instincts; it's important to gameplay that you care wheter you die or not. This is the reason the game is not unceasing action. One might think ""action is the fun part of the game - why don't we remove the boring looting and farming, give everyone infinite materials and good weapons right at the start of the game, and make the initial circle smaller?"". Should this happen, the game would be pure action. You would die and just come back right in for the next game, not really frustrated, because each game doesn't matter. This has already happened in other games that have auto respawn options - it really becomes unimportant chaos, and you quickly get tired of playing. 

This shows us something: purpose comes from tension. In order for you to actually care if you die or not, you have to feel like there's something to lose: all this time I spent farming, all this loot that was difficult to find, all the right rotating I had to do to get here. This makes your life, each round, so important. That is why we can play so many games in a day and still be frustrated when we die: because we care, because we invest ourselves each time, time and time again. When you finally find another player, it's a climax moment: all the tension, all the investment, it all depends on staying alive. Kill or be killed. It matters. 

The game has a rhythm: like a song, it builds up for the climax. But it can't be climax all the time - it can't be action all the time, because if it is, the action loses it's sense of importancy. The lack of action in the game - let's now call it ""build-up tension"" - is not a issue you have to adress, Epic. It's part of the tissue that mantains the very soul of your game. 

Well, Zombies ruin build-up tension. 

I know they are supposed to be fun. I know they're supposed to add something. But sometimes, too much of something can disrupt gaming experience. Contemporary philosopher Byung-Chul Han believes ""at a certain point, too much information becomes disinformation"". This can be translated to Fortnite: action all the time actually makes the game crowded, polluted, noisy. The game loses its rhythm. There's less build-up tension. This means each round has less purpose and is more stressfull. You can't breathe. 

I have been experiencing this: since zombies came back, I've played each day less and less, because I don't seem to be able to have fun on Fortnite while they're around. 

Gestalt Psychology #1 principle: we don't perceive the world as multiple individual stimuli, we tend to form global wholes.  This is what gives meaning to action. 

When you add Zombies, you are adding exactly... individual stimuli. You are going the opposite way of how the human mind works. They're uninteresting. You don't need skill to kill them. You shoot them, they are dead, they come again. 

Adding Zombies underestimate who we players are. Fortnite's players have learned to play this game so well, with amazing build battles, quick edits, mind games... a game so complex, so intricate, with so much space to learning, developing skills, going against good players... 

We don't need pointless NPC's. You can add as many zombies as you want. Sometimes, more is less.

Least Controversial

- Damage to planes should reduce their mobility.
Imo a good solution to the problems of planes.

- Chug jugs should be have 2 uses of 100 health/shield that take slightly longer than medkits to use.
Usually players won’t carry chug jugs (unless in squads), so this would just make them more viable in solos/duos. I’ve seen ideas like this everywhere, so I don’t know who came up with it first.

- Presents should stay in the game.
I’m assuming presents are being removed because they’re Christmas themed, but I think if they could only drop non-explosives, they’d be a fine item. They’re a fun way to trap people too.

- Players should be able to turn boomboxes off and on.
Stay there and hold interact for maybe 1 or 2 seconds. However, they can be re-enabled, so watch out.

- Grenades should make a noise within 1 second of exploding.
From my understanding they’re supposed to be stealthy, but when they soar through the air and don’t bounce once it’s literally impossible for you react.

- Players should be able to carry at most 6 rockets.
This may seem like too little in squads but don’t forget that your teammates can carry extra rockets for you. This would also encourage players to use rockets strategically rather than spam.

(I’m not sure on this one but I’ll throw it out there)
- Horizontal bounce pads from Creative should be added to BR.
The speed should not be insanely good, and shouldn’t be changeable. It has nice mobility, but would make skirmishes less entertaining to watch because rotating would need less of the skill of tunneling.

- The Guided Missile should be unvaulted.
The speed should be much faster and it should have unlimited duration, but it should only do 30 damage to players and maybe a grenade’s worth of explosive damage. This would make it more focused on scouting and rocket riding rather than attacking players.

- All pistols should have extremely good accuracy when jumping, when strafing, and when hip firing.
It’s already more difficult to aim when clicking 7 times a second, and furthermore  
pistols only do 23 - 26 damage. I understand it’s a low tier weapon, but it shouldn’t be completely useless.

- All pumps variants should decrease by 5 damage.
This is just for consistency. Usually a re-skin of guns means significantly better — scars can 3 shot but regular ARs can’t, suppressed pistols can 4 shot but regular pistols cant. This would allow SPASs to one tap while pumps can’t.

- Hitting one shotgun pellet should not be as powerful has hitting 3.
I’m tired of people blaming 7 damage shots on the game, rather than their aim. I understand that ping can factor in to this, but tripling your shotgun’s damage for a lackluster shot is far from a good way to solve this. Maybe everyone forgot that in season 5 all shotguns became 100% consistent.

- Tactical shotguns should have a 2.25x headshot multiplier.
The gun is just not very rewarding compared to pumps. Most players drop a blue tactical over a green pump, and to be honest most would still do that after this change, but I believe that tacs and pumps shouldn’t have a massive difference in viability.

- The Double Barreled should be unvaulted.
It should be buffed to 130/135 damage. It was a great, balanced gun that players failed to see the potential of. Maybe make shotguns do only 50% damage to builds to balance it a bit, because during season 5 it’s biggest problem was being able to break through fully built wood with one shot.

- Hand Cannons should not deal 150 damage to builds.
If we’re being honest here, other than actually shooting enemies, the gun takes 0 skill to use. If you think breaking builds with one shot is a fun way to play the game we already have the heavy sniper. It’s much more balanced because it can’t spam 7 shots and reload practically instantly. Ok, not instantly, but unlike snipers, double barreled shotguns, and explosives, you’ll have a very good chance of having a time to reload hand cannons mid fight. I’m pretty sure this buff to the hand cannon during Fortnitemares was to counter turtling, but don’t forget we have stink bombs.

Most Controversial

You mark a spot on the map prior to the bus taking off (by the way, perfectly willing, should they mark a spot elsewhere, to change it up). Rather than responding with the common courtesy which is to place a matching marker of their own near the one you originally placed (or like I said, place their own on the POI they would like to drop), they simply fail to place any marker. Which would be fine, except for the fact that they then proceed to jump to a completely unknown/unmarked POI with zero explanation or consideration.

Fine, whatever. So then, occasionally you win the random fill lotto and actually get someone who knows how to properly execute the procedure described above. You are gliding through the air toward the agreed upon POI, basking in the glee that is knowing you will actually not have to take on every duo/squad you see by yourself. You both land, then one of the following two things happen:

-They end up being a loot thieving teammate. The type that could be in a building with 200 chests and just the two of you inside to loot them, and rather than seek out his or her own chests, they'd prefer to just vulture the items from the chests you're opening. Not in a friendly or funny way, just as a prick. 

-If you manage to avoid that guy, don't worry, instead, he or she will either manage to fall to their death, or find the one enemy within 100 yards of you guys and get absolutely obliterated by them without making any attempt to enlist your assistance with that undertaking. 

UGH, I've literally been really trying to give random fill a chance, because I thought maybe I just had a bad impression. So I've been playing HEAVY doses of random fill lobbies, especially random fill normal squads (because this stupid ice storm event is blocking normal solos and duos (a whole other annoyance, but I digress) and duos Snipers. And I can honestly say, any bad impression I had after my first set of experiences were strongly reinforced and strengthened by this last round of experimentation I've conducted. 

Its pretty simple really. If you don't want to play as a team, either play Solos or turn off random fill. Its that SIMPLE!!! For God's sake, please.",FortNiteBR

First instance: Playing a **solo** match to visit **Wailing and Haunted**. I was planning to land directly at Lonely's expedition, take a plan and kill myself after doing my challenge. Another player had the same idea. He landed first and started flying away. I hitchhiked a ride on his plane and together we went to do our challenge. 

Second instance: Playing Team **Rumble**, had to do **Explosive eliminations**. I was *crouching and uncrouching* holding dynamite in my hand, in front of an Ice King, as he had a Grenade Launcher, he dropped it, immediately. We met again and again on Dusty's mountain, I gave it back to him after doing my challenge.

First thing I wanted to talk about was the ice storm challenges. The second the golden brute challenge was revealed everyone started to whine and complain about the challenge being too “hard”. Have you ever heard of challenge? It’s suppose to be hard. Plus, it’s not like Epic forced you to do them. They’re giving you a chance to wear free cosmetics and when you can’t get them. You start to whine and cry on the subreddit to the point where they just had to make it easier so it’s not even a challenge at this point.

The next thing I wanted to talk about was the bugs in the game. I hear everyone complain about ghost markers, weapons shooting randomly, etc. Have you ever thought of how hard it is to make a game and fix bugs that come with it? A better way to help the bugs is to record it and send it in to Epic instead of posting it on the subreddit every single day saying that you’re sick of the bug happening and then threatening to quit the game. I’m sure Epic doesn’t care if you quit the game and you probably wouldn’t because you play everyday.

Another thing you guys should remember is that this is a free game that Epic didn’t even think would even be successful. They don’t have to update every single week. People are so spoiled about the things Epic have done that when they don’t like something that is op and will ruin their sweaty status, they want them to remove from the game the very next day. 

Adapting to change is part of games like Fortnite. I hope the toxicity changes and this subreddit will be like when it was in season 2 where people posted cool clips instead of ranting every day about a bug or something they don’t like. This is my personal opinion on the subreddit and so this post might be downvoted to oblivion but I don’t care.

We all love this game, and Epic not acknowledging the community’s criticisms anymore is showing their priorities and isn’t good for the game.","Seriously, this isn’t a hate post or a bash on Epic. I’m genuinely concerned with the state of the game right now and it’s extremely hard for me to keep playing. Planes are a massive problem, they only need a few tweaks to be totally fine but Epic is showing no urgency to make change. Nor are they acknowledging/communicating with us so we have something to look forward to. 

I think most of us can agree that Epics content additions as well are starting to seem less thought out as well. They’re testing less, leaving things as is etc. The excessive mobility in this game is absolutely horrendous right now. There is way too much going on and way too many people dying. Third, fourth, fifth party and so on all day everyday. Third partying should be a strat 100%, but not all game for every single fight its insane how fast people can get around these days. 

After a full year of the game as well, the player base has improved a lot. Yes there are still bots and newcomers, but the average skill level has definitely rose. So now adding in anti skill items, and handing out rng like candy is also not very healthy for this game. Epic just needs to slow down,dial it back a bit and work on what we have right now. There’s def more that can go into this but its being said everyday, (QoL, performance, graphic settings, ranked, etc). 

TL;DR - Epic needs to slow down and reevaluate the state of the game. 1,000 ways to die isn’t fun. Quality over quantity. ",FortNiteBR

I've tried everything I can think of: Watching tutorial videos and pro steamers. Landing in Tilted over and over, landing in safe areas like Wailing. I watch replays of my games to see where I went wrong and where I can improve. But despite all of that, no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to get a win. Just getting a kill feels like a victory for me.

Just in case any of this information is relevant:

*  I've played 751 games and have a 0.46 KD.
* I only have 2 wins, and even then, I don't feel like they should count. The first was during Fortnitemares, which was a mess, and the second was because of the sword, which was obviously OP.
* I'm 17 and Fortnite is my second PvP shooter and my first BR game; I grew up mostly playing slow-paced strategy games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem (maybe that's part of the reason?)
* I play with Builder Pro, Turbo Build enabled.
* I play on XB1, Cross-play disabled (Had to turn it off because I kept dying to people blatantly using aimbot.)
* Sensitivities- 0.673 X, 0.612 Y, 0.404 ADS, 0.28 Scope, 2.0 Building.

I think my three biggest problems are my lack of confidence, my bad aim, and my tunnel-visioning.

I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldn't beat myself up for being bad since I'm still pretty new to both Shooters and PvP games, and I try to find something I did right in a game to make myself feel less upset. But no matter how much I do this, I eventually get very upset and have to force myself to stop playing just to try and calm myself down.

In terms of aim, It goes hand-in-hand with my inexperience. I know that aim comes with time and practice, and that it's much harder to aim with a controller then on PC.

But I think my tunnel-vision is my biggest problem. I'll try to go into a game to work on a specific aspect that I want to improve on only to have my brain completely flat-line, leading me to ""go through the motions"" without thinking or planning.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. Am I just doomed to never be good at the game? Is there still any hope of me being good?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. And if anyone with a good amount of experience could help me in-game somehow, I would be extremely grateful (GT is xSideQuestHerox if you do decide to help).",FortNiteBR

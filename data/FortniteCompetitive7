 Combat Shotgun

* Reduced the availability from floor loot from 2.015% to 1.409%
* Reduced the availability from chest loot from 2.183% to 1.846%

&amp;#x200B;

This is a very bad change. A lot of people prefer the combat shotgun over the tac shotgun. i already find it hard to find a combat shotgun, even when looting an entire big poi like Pressure Plant. and now they decrease the spawn rate instead of increasing it. bad change imo. during last weekend qualifier i looted the entire poi all of my games. Yet there was like 3 games i went out from the poi without the combat shotgun. This is really mind blowing considering all the floor and chest spawns in this location. The combat shotgun should be as common of a drop, as the green and blue pumps used to be.",FortniteCompetitive

Controller players and PC Players play together. There are pros and cons to each choice of device but with Controllers player you have the option for Aim Assist which gives a helping hand to controller players which doesn't seem competitive especially because Aim Assist isn't something that players need to work on it's quite literally a gift from the developers.  


For PC players everything you do is an action that you do yourself whether its tracking or flicking its all muscle memory that a PC player has practiced for and if you miss its partially because of bloom and Partial because your aim was bad.  


[Example of Aim Assist](https://youtu.be/QZlxHKiIK7k?t=297)

On the other hand as a controller player you have a hard time doing edits and shooting and stuff but the reality is that you put your self at a disadvantage because you choose to use two sticks for movement/aim when PC players use their whole arms. I think Aydan is right in this video\[[Aydan](https://www.twitch.tv/aydan/clip/FurryWealthyTarsierFreakinStinkin?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time)\] people are looking for reasons to complain but the reality of the situation is that there is a lack of true competition.  


When you die to a PC Players there is no doubt that the player hit his shots and he didn't have outside help

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand when you die to a controller player yeah they might have had solid builds but you can't tell how much of the skill of aiming was actually them and how much of it was the aim assist.   


On the other hand you have the perspective of a controller player who has a hard time doing a lot of the things a PC player can do which is expected but for controller players it is very hard to be accurate when shooting which makes sense why they are allowed aim assist. But getting shot at with aim assist doesn't really feel fair. Because it takes the skill out of being a good aimer for controller players. No one can dispute that its not truly competitive if theres player playing on mouse and keyboard who has had to practicing aiming/building/editing and then there's a player playing with controller and aim assist who has a harder time editing/building but they have something helping them aim to an extent.  


  
There's also aim assit for players that are in Shadow Bomb Form . It's light but I don't think that seems fair.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Aim Assist doesn't belong in competitive because its essentially a player(No help) play vs a Player(with help AKA Aim Assist)",FortniteCompetitive

Im not sure if many of you guys have seen in Atlantis NA we have made a new Division which is incorporating Rosenfoles power rankings. If you haven't seen check out #FAQ in the discord. 
Ok so heres the update, After reviewing the last week of our Contender matches, we have decided to increase the amount of points needed to qualify for the role to 1,250 points minimum. This point increase will not only up the quality of players that will participate in our scrims, but it will also result in many more professional players practicing here.

This point change will still allow players who have consistently placed well in the past to play in our matches, but it will also create an environment where the majority of the players participating are placing well in the World Cup Qualifiers.
Heres a [link](https://fortnite-esports.gamepedia.com/Power_Rankings:Rosenfole/North_America/Players) to Rosenfoles Power Rankings, FA tab is also included!

We hope to see more active and high placing players joining in the coming days.

However he misses the fact that Tfue just wants to be free from his contract. Tfue and his lawyer had already made a request but it was ignored. If Banks really cared for Tfue like he says he does, he would have understood and respected Tfue’s choice and let him pursue the future he wanted to on his own terms. The lawsuit states how the contract is not only unfair, it’s very restrictive on sponsorships and brand deals. Tfue puts in tons of work on his end on YT and TTV that attracts brands that are probably offering him insane amounts of money and due to his influence, but he’s being denied those opportunities. I’d say he’s up there with personal brands that includes Ninja, DrDisrespect, and Shroud, except these guys enjoy the freedom to take those opportunities, do commercials, have in game skins, signature merch, and all that cool shit you can do to grow your brand and make decent money at the same time. Tfue might feel like he’s missing out on deals that are way more helpful and lucrative than just being associated with FaZe. He has huge potential to be extremely successful on his own, and the contract, that isn’t even legally written, is holding him back. FaZe is holding him back, and maybe they didn’t want to let Tfue out of his contract because he’s their golden boy. It’d be a terrible move on their part to lose their biggest talent and arguably their best player, but they obviously haven’t done anything to want to make him stay.",FortniteCompetitive

Yes I know there's input lag and all but for now I gotta stick to what I have and hopefully in a few months ill be able to buy my very first gaming pc! I think i'm doing pretty well my edits are 3x faster than on console, the scroll wheel reset is insane, aiming is a bit harder but I feel more free to aim with a mouse, love the feel of the keyboard and building and everything, feels much better than using a controller. I've been practicing for hours and i'm getting the hang of it but still need more practice. I was wondering if anyone on here though maybe have some tips for a beginner mouse and keyboard player? Do I need to change my mouse DPI or is it just fine to use my in game sens only for now, i never touched the dpi it was built in the mouse itself, I use a  silvercrest ergonomic wireless mouse, I don't know if it's good or not but It's comfortable for me, keyboard is also silvercrest just the regular silvercrest gaming keyboard. I feel like the keyboard is pretty good just need opinions on the mouse and if I should get another one or not, other than that I do not have a mouse pad and was wondering If I need it that much and if there's any tips I should know. I also heard a lot of pc players talking about something called ""macro"" and I tried searching what it means but I can't seem to understand, I only know macro as in macro in photography meaning very close images.

Part 1: A reminder on Part 2: Former CLG CEO weighs in Part 3: My opinion.,"TLDR: We don't really know what's going on, in my opinion, it's shitty if the FaZe shit is true, Tfue probably wanted out of Faze and got held to his contract which was shitty. Watch the video [here,  start at 3 hours 10 minutes](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427456285).

Part 1 A reminder : 

Please don't shit on Tfue's or Banks of Faze Clan, we're going to know the full story soon and we will probably see that full contract soon as well, go onto Twitter and shit on 1 side or the other or have opinions like Tfue is desperate or banks is a shitty person. WE DONT KNOW THE FULL STORY.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2 Watch this video: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427456285](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427456285) Start at 3 hours 1 minute 

&amp;#x200B;

Part 3 What I think is going on :

&amp;#x200B;

Based off of the Hollywood Reporter article, which essentially states that Tfue's contract limited him in getting outside team sponsorships like Ninja's Samsung sponsorship or even League Pro Doublelifts U GG sponsorship, because of the contract which states that even if he were to take this contract he would only take 20% of what he got paid for. While I don't understand the parts of the contract where people are debating on how much they took from Tfue's twitch revenue and youtube revenue(faze says they took no money and Tfue's lawsuit paperwork flies right over my head), they did, however, say that in the original contract if a deal is brought to the gamer that FaZe will take 80%, you can find this [here](https://twitter.com/FaZeClan/status/1130625973953736706). They say that they never ever collected anything from it, or Tfue except from 60k in which they don't disclose how or why they got that money. Now that I've finished summarizing this I'm going to say this. I HIGHLY doubt that Faze has never collected money as a result of Tfue joining FaZe clan, now they say that they havent taken revenue but that seems highly unlikely, even if tfue is making 60K a year from FaZe clan because his contract is from before he really blew up, FaZe still needs to turn a profit. Also their brand is significantly stronger with Tfue there. It gives them a twitch audience that is consistent and diversify's their brand past youtube content. Because of Tfue's contract, he probably doesn't get paid as much as if he left FaZe because of the highly lucrative brand deals he can negotiate.

 I also highly doubt that Tfue has intentions of being desperate, he's made 1.5million+ from tourney money and his twitch subs are popping tf off, his youtube hit 10 million so fast. I think that Tfue wanted out because he wanted to make money (which is fine, FaZe didn't build his brand, Tfue did Faze cane along for the ride, also why would you not want to make more money) and FaZe said no, which is a big fucking mistake, its explained in the Devin nash video but still just as a consumer of esports content and a marketing intern you don't want to do this, it makes your company look really really fucking bad also, Tfue probably didn't want to be associated with a kid who may be 11(even if this kid is 13 its still illegal). 

Also, banks is looking really bad right now, as an owner of a fairly large company in general, you don't tweet shit like this especially if your story is right. Nadeshot was not trying to be an asshole, he's just saying if this is true don't tear Faze and banks apart.",FortniteCompetitive

Real friends would at chat about the situation” This is absolutely stupid. 
So let’s start. Assuming Tfue does indeed go through with this and they don’t settle outside of court, and assuming Tfue isn’t talking about banks, and he’s talking about someone else, as an organization, Faze will undoubtably call banks up as a witness, seeing he is the founder, and probably the main reason Tfue was signed. If you are suing someone, almost 100% of the time your attorney will tell you not to contact anyone that could possibly be a witness. By Tfue contacting banks, it could Jeopardize his case. Their attorneys are probably chatting it up, seeing if they can settle this through Arbitration or, as stated above, a settlement of some sort. Now I could be VERY wrong, but this is most likely the result of argues attorney trying to protect the case they are trying to bring to court. I highly doubt this is as personal as everyone makes it, and is more on the legal side of things.

But in this case I think something shady happened on the side of Tfues Manager team. Maybe someone took more then they deserved and lied about the income of Tfues branddeals. Now someone pressured him into filling this lawsuit to cover their own ass. Maybe buying time to dip the country?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me preface by saying I don't really care how this whole thing turns out.  Some things seem fishy on both sides of this, and at the end of the day I'll still be watching Tfue's streams AND other member's of FaZe.  I am neutral/unbiased.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to try and provide some more information and detail on the legal side of this.  What is Tfue actually claiming, and how it could impact other Orgs and really E-Sports as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's lay out the claims Tfue is making and his grounds for each, along with their legal explanations and potential larger implications.

&amp;#x200B;

* The ""Gamer Agreement"" between Tfue and Faze is ""grossley oppressive, onerous, and on-sided"" and uses ""illegal and anti-competitive provisions in the Gamer Agreement to severely limit Tenney's ability to compete in the marketplace."" (quoted from the official case report)
   * Grounds:
      * FaZe allegedly only allows Tfue to accept sponsorship deals that are presented to him by the FaZe Clan.  Meaning Tfue could not go out on his own and get paid to advertise in some manner for a company that doesn't also have a relationship with FaZe.  
   * Explanation
      * The California Business and Professions Code (Section 16600) states that ""every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extend void.""  Basically, California prohibits any contract that restricts anyone from pursuing their best interests.  This code was put into place specifically to protect employees from being forced into unfair ""non-compete"" disclosures from an employer.  However, it can be applied to any contractual situation (I think?). SO, if Tfue's contract does in fact state that he can only accept sponsorship offers that are presented to him by FaZe clan, this WOULD violate section 16600.  Therefore Tfue's contract, by California law, is null and void. 
   * Implications 
      * This could potentially have a ripple effect across all E-Sports orgs in all varieties of titles.  I personally have never read through a professional gaming contract, as I don't believe they are commonly made available to the public.  However, if this ""restrictive clause"" is in fact included in Tfue's contract, it likely commonly exists in contracts across the industry.  What does this mean?  Potentially, any contract with an E-Sports org based in California that contains a similar cause could also be ruled null/void.  Given the California is a pretty popular area for E-Sports, countless players could be released from their contracts.
*  ""Faze Clan's Gamer Agreements are illegal for yet another reason: they violate California's Talent Agency Act which protects artists from those like Faze Clan that act as an unlicensed talent agency.""
   * Grounds:
      * California's ""Talent Agency Act"" states that any ""agent"" that acts on the behalf of ""talent"" must acquire a license from the Labor Commissioner.  With California being a hotbed for the film industry, music industry, etc..., the state regulates the relationship between ""Talent"" and ""Agents"" as they are easily exploitable.  Without them, anyone with some sort of contract law knowledge could pretty easily take advantage of an actor or musician and take more money than they deserve.  This claim as it relates to the Tfue case is very interesting because it's uncharted territory.  Gaming is a relatively new industry when compared to film/music.  The ruling on this will be dependant on if the courts do in fact deem gamers/streamers as ""Talent"" and their orgs as ""agents.""  From what I am seeing in the Talent Agency Act, I do believe both would fit their respective definitions.
   * Implications
      * This could really be a doozy. If the court rules what I outlined above, that gamers and orgs fit into the definitions of Talent and Agents, this would set a precedent.  This would mean that any org based in California would have to acquire an Agent's License from the Labor Commissioner, and therefore follow ALL regulations and prohibitions from the Talent Agency Act.  This really could change the way the industry operates.

Tfue is arguably the biggest name in the fortnite *competitive* scene. He has a lot of respect in the community. You could see the pull he has in the pro community by the success of the Tfault Scrims, especially before arena became a thing. I think young pros would be hyped to get signed to his org if he had one. As for Cloak, if he's leaving too, they seem somewhat close and maybe the timing of them leaving together is a power move to aid in lowering FaZe Clan as competition to their new org.

Also random thought why'd Tfue buy a warehouse 🤔 😂

Which could explain Epic's radical changes as of recent.","Let me start by saying I have not played a second of season 9 due to Epic's recent ""additions""/removals from the game I loved, and fully admit that I am biased. I am also a casual player, so my frustrations with Epic have stemmed from me feeling that their decisions have hurt the casual players like myself and my friends, instead of appealed to us. And at the expense of competitive players, nonetheless. 

I was bored and, since Epic doesn't release any numbers on the game's performance (and what numbers they do release are cherry picked), I decided to check the only reliable source of information regarding Fortnite that we have: Google Trends. 

All trends are worldwide, although I observed U.S. interest fall below the worldwide interest in the game. I also set it to ""past 5 years"", since the second-longest option is 12 months, and the game has been out far longer than that.

Starting off simple, we see that the term [""fortnite""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=fortnite) peaked at the end of July 2018, and has since dropped to 51% of its popularity. But this can be misleading, since you can just argue that everyone knows what Fortnite is at this point so of course people aren't searching the term as often.

Next up is [""fortnite download""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=fortnite%20download), which peaked in March 2018 and has since dropped to a staggering 21% of its old popularity. Again, it can be argued that most people would know how to go and download Fortnite, so this number also isn't representative of much. 

This is where it gets interesting. If you check the trend for [""fortnite season""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=fortnite%20season), you can see that it unsurprisingly peaks every time there is a new season. **However**, that peak has been getting less and less with every season. It peaked at 100 for both seasons 4 and 5, followed by 92 in season 6, 90 in season 7 (still amazing), 82 in season 8, and finally a mere 61 when season 9 released. 

A similar trend is seen for [""fortnite battlepass""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=fortnite%20battlepass), which again peaked at season 4 and has since dropped to 41% when season 9 released. 

The outlier in these trends is the term [""fortnite item shop""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=fortnite%20item%20shop), which actually peaked in October 2018 when the Halloween skins were getting released, and slightly peaks around major holidays when holiday-themed skins release. It has since dropped to 46%, although I should note that it rose by 6% from what it was the week before. So it's not all downhill. 

And just for fun, the term [""competitive fortnite""](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=competitive%20fortnite) actually peaked in the first week of April this year. It has since dropped to 40%, though I imagine it'll rise come the World Cup. 

These numbers can tell us a lot, or they can tell us nothing. Fortnite did apparently reach peak concurrent players with the Marshmello event, so it clearly is still very much alive. But it would be an insane coincidence if all of these individual terms just happened to be showing the same thing. I imagine the changes to the game will get more extreme if the trend continues. 

Do with this information what you will. I'm not here to argue and have tried to be as transparent as possible. Fortnite isn't dying, and there's no way to tell whether these trends translate to the playerbase decreasing, but it is definitely losing people's interest. It's no surprise that aside from the Marshmello ""concurrent users"" number, Epic only releases ""total user"" numbers. Because that number can never decrease, and active players can and do make new accounts so of course it'll be inflated. 

I'm just tired of the ""lol dead game"" arguments just as much as I am tired of ""Epic knows what they're doing and they have numbers to back up their decisions"". I only wish they were publicly traded and we could actually access their Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow statements. But they're not, so here's numbers that can easily be argued they don't mean much instead.",FortniteCompetitive

Example, The Los Angeles Open would be only players from the state of California, and New York open would be only players from the state of new york and so forth. They could do something similar with Europe in countries that have high player populations. They could do a lot of these tournaments for lower amounts of moneys at first and then have the state/ country winners from each respective state/country in a lobby for a grand final with entry by state/country qualification. 

Each state/country(for eu) winner then qualifies for a grand final and state/ country flags are shown by there name in broadcast 

Even if the lans are held at smaller venues in some cities where its harder to accommodate in this hypothetical, i feel like 100 players per state/ country(with a high enough Fortnite server population) would be easily attainable given fortnite's insanely competitive nature at the moment

Pro players that say they are quitting will for sure want to attempt to get their respective state or country's ""#1 player"" spot regardless of how much money they win(for the title cause i know i would love to represent my state or country in this hypothetical) and compete in a grand final with best players in the:

\-U.S. by state (50)

\-Europe by country (44) 

 \-Australia by states (which I'm sure they'll love granted they get 1 spot every other week which is fucked, but I also understand since Epic bases it off population/competitive nature)

\-South America by country with enough active players(not trying to sound ignorant, I just don't honestly know the player population in South America other than Brazil because thats where the server is located)

(12 countries IF every country could possibly host a lan tournament qualifier (following an EPIC instituted qualifying system that they decide) and market it to the gaming community depending on how they see fit with data, (they know more than I do in this hypothetical)

Asia by country(48)

IMPORTANT INTERUPTION IN HYPOTHETICAL

I've been reading players complaining from SEA about horrible ping and not being able to even play competitive fortnite due to horrendous ping(100-250 range) (which would me make me break keyboards being an NA West Single digit ping player but thats not important but i felt that ping fact cant be brushed over)

This system would give each of those countries an opportunity at an epic hosted lan tournament where 1 spot is granted following an online qualifying system that is as fair as possible with there current state (either open quals of base it off stats since ping is too bad, that way a kid thats Goated on shitty ping would qualify which would be interesting to see when he/she has normal ping at they hypothetical finals where they represent their country)

&amp;#x200B;

That being said i'm sure my hypothetical system isn't perfect but i have thought of other things that may not have been covered above that you guys are thinkings about

\-States and countries in EACH regions with insanely higher populations than the rest of the world should be granted more spots in comparison with the bare minimum being 1 per state/country based off population.

\-State/country ""opens""(open as  in golf or tennis tournament) lan tournaments would eliminate clout hungry stream sniper shits who try and grief games for big pros and streamers. And some of these streamers are losing the opportunity to go to the current world cup cause losers are watching their screens. There are thousands of these kids and its hard for epic to stop them all when there are 100k viewer streamers attempting to qualify. People just want the clout and no amount of devs can stop them with the current system

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize this whole system

STEP 1: players play in online qualifiers for the opportunity to play in lan tournament state/countryside for EACH state or country in the world. Each player is placed into a pool by state or country

STEP 2 : top 100 players from each state or country are invited to a lan tournament in their home state or country(hosted in capital or most populated city)(Ex, Fortnite Los Angeles Open) compete in a 7-10 game series with the current scoring system

STEP 3: top players from fortnite opens(1 for countries and states with low amounts of players, more spots for states and countries with higher populations, im sure epic would scale it) would then earn a trophy and winnings for the open and be crowned open winner and then qualify for worlds.

STEP 4: A world cup with players representing states/ countries competing against each other for hometown bragging rights and fat winnings

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I just wanted to see what some other like minded competitive players think about a system similar to this and any other factors that would hinder something like this from being even possible.

1. Is there any way of modifying arena mode to make it more competitive (eg; loot pool, vehicle availability, start with matts and shield, etc.) This would benefit both casual and competitive communities of Fortnite.
2. Shotgun delay timer is still in the game even after vaulting of pump. (Evident after editting a wall) Any news on if this will be removed from the game?
3. Epic mentioned that there will not be a FOV slider due to significant gameplay advantages. Is there any possibility that the company has changed their mind on this? Is there any possibility of us seeing an FOV slider? (Suggestion: If FOVs like 100+ are too much of an advantage, maybe just make the slider 80-100) 
4. There still seems to be some audio problems, any news on this?
5. Are there any updates on the 1v1 Duel mode that was mentioned before?
6. Can there be an option to turn off/on pre edits?
7. There have been concerns with vehicles, specifically the baller. Are there any plans to balance this aspect of the game? (eg: Disabling vehicles after the 5th zone, much like the slipstream)

For example: Hit edit on wall, left stick click and wall edits so bottom right triangle opens

Hit edit on ramp, left stick click and ramp rotates 180 degrees.

The options are ""limitless"" / based on the number of buttons on your controller.

This would greatly reduce the skillgap between PC and console in regards to editing. Yes, there are some fast console 'editers' out there, but even they cannot compete with a semi-decent PC player who knows how to edit. With this, we would see more console players able to be in a box with another player, edit their ramp, take a shot, edit the ramp in half, take a shot, reset the ramp, edit in half again, take a shot. Again, there are some console players who are capable of doing this - but they work 3x as hard for something that is so much easier to do on PC. This would enable console players to close range fight against PC players much better.

Is there a console player who would not like this? I don't think it would be ""overpowered"" - it would just boost console players to where PC players are already at.",FortniteCompetitive

Because imo, this format isn’t a accurate representation of who the best in the world is since you are playing against a bunch of Champion league arena players even though it is the top 3000 or 1500 the skill level has a huge drop off after the first couple hundred people (It maybe more accurate to say the best W-Keyers in the world??).  And this post is not to discredit the people who have already qualified of course you still have to be nuts to do so. But I think it’s disrespectful to the people like Bizzle, Tfue, and Vivid who have been playing against some of Best players and consistently dominating for a whole year then a couple 14 yr olds we found out about 3 weeks ago double qualify and now they’re the best in the world",FortniteCompetitive

They weren't talking about editing, building or shooting but game sense.  


After thinking about it for a while I came to the conclusion that 100% a coach can improve your skill.   


Think about it, a lot of players out there are incredible when it comes to building and editing. We can see their sick clips on Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, but they tend to not go far on Sundays, sometimes they don't even qualify.   
The reason for that is simple (to me), they fucked up their rotation somehow.   


All of us who have reached the late game know how easy you can f\*ck it up. Wrong timing, wrong location, not thinking about the way others will rotate in, advantage points, tactical points and timings. The very best players always get to the late late game because they know how to rotate and when to use their utility.   


I argue that a coach can improve your game sense significantly. I will use myself as an example.  
I have not been able to reach a Sunday, with 48 points being my best result (duos). I am not a great builder or editor but my rotation is good. I think about the map a lot, I watch where the other players are tending to shot and look.   
But I just don't have the mechanical skill. I am working on getting better but it is okay, I want to reach a final just to show myself that I can. My duo partner, on the other hand, doesn't know how to rotate, rotates too quick too slow, horrible locations etc. But damn he can fight.  I am trying to transfer my 'Gamesense' knowledge to his, which has been working, slowly.  


Now the question that I ask myself is if we do have players here that can actually coach those things. I think we do and I also believe it to be the way of the future for many pros. Especially to those who do not want to spend 8 hours a day trying to keep up to date. A good coach can take a lot of time away, time that is scarce for a lot of pro players at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, there might be an 'EGO' problem with the players not wanting a coach but that is just speculation.",FortniteCompetitive

Is controller on pc worth it for a decent player wanting to majorly improve?,"Want to be able to play on highest FPS, I’ve been grinding recently and want to take my game up and feel I’m a bit restricted on console. I’d consider myself a decent player, not great but I have time to play and practice. I have the drive and motivation to improve and I’m not gonna do that playing console pubs or having a disadvantage playing console in arena. Is it worth it for me to start playing PC with controller, will I notice a huge change? 
I’m looking at getting a good pc regardless, I study computing in college so it’s not purely for Fortnite. 
Any suggestions on a really good pc with capabilities of playing Fortnite on all the highest settings, but also being decent for all around computing, that won’t break the bank? Don’t wanna spend an insane amount.

Cheers!

TL;DR - decent console player, wanting to change to pc and wanting to improve my game massively. Is it worth it on controller? Looking for a pc able to play Fortnite to all its highest settings, but also one for casual use and computing. Any suggestions?",FortniteCompetitive

Boom Bow - This weapon is busted; hard to track, easy to find ammo, hits like a truck, limitless range. 

Stink Bombs - another consumable that rreplaces heals, virtually no counter

Heavy Sniper - I'm torn, I both love and hate this weapon, but sometimes seems a little too strong. 

Heavy AR - after the damage nerf this gun is very.. lackluster. For the bloom to damage ratio you are better off with a regular AR.

Impulse nades - personal opinion. not really relevant, takes up shield drops 

Dynamite - just not very useful late game, another consumable that takes up heals.

**Region:** NAE

**Age:** 21 almost 22 (now 22)

**Platform:** PC

**Gamertag:** Coach.21

**Stats/Experience:**

Solo Finals - 468th place

Duo Finals - 550 place (with a random controller player)

Scallywag Final 278th place (same guy)

Contender in solos (didn't get to play placement matches)

STL duo Contender (only got to play the placement games due to a job)

Week 3 Solo finals 1700th ish place (would have to look it up to be exact, but on my laptop right now)

Only been taking comp seriously for about 8-9 months and scrim about 4-5 nights a week. I am fairly good mechanically as I have been grinding 1v1s for the past 10-11 months.

---
**Misc:** I coach baseball so I will need someone who is willing to scrim later at night when practices are over. I usually get home around 8:30pm (CST) and can play tell Midnight. I work mornings from 4-8 and usually take a nap, but once games start I will use this time to get more practice in. I wont be able to play from 3-8:30am and 2:30-8:30pm until May 24th (can obviously play on the weekends), Then my practice schedule will change and we can talk about that when the time comes.

Back to fortnite. I play a lot more solo scrims than duos so I am unsure if my comms are good or not, but my recent duo didn't say much about them. I feel I make very smart decisions about when and where to rotate, but want to learn how others do things to further expand my knowledge. The thing I struggle with most is when to take high ground late game. I have just started today going back and watching the vods of people who had high ground in my games and trying to learn from that.

---
Wrote that recent Paragraph about a month ago. Here is a list of things that I honestly feel I have improved at.

\-Rotating to half in half out zone

\-Taking high ground

\-When to play aggressive late moving zones

\-I feel my comms are decent, but old duo still never said anything about it

\- I also never play with ballers, so I feel I have learned how to rotate well.

I can play support or the aggressor. Can also IGL if need.

---
Things I want from a partner

\- Be honest about what we need to work on or what you think needs to change

\- Make it clear what role we are playing, whether that be IGL or support and aggressor (Obviously it can change during game, but nice to know how we are going to approach a fight)

\- Good Comms

\- Doesn't get upset easily when practicing

\- Also mechanically good

&amp;#x200B;

As the title suggests, I believe that the root cause of Fortnite's issues is that Epic is trying to establish cross-platform play, whatever the cost.

With their intention of establishing cross-platform play (and everyone playing the same Fortnite, as their blog suggests ...) comes the act of balancing the game across multiple platforms, that are inherently diffrent from eachother. PCs are, because they are more powerful, offer more customization etc., at a constant advantage compared to other platforms. Epic's effort to minimize the advantages PC has over other platforms results in decisions like the recent stretched resolution change. With this came the discussion about how the default FOV lessens ingame awareness, causes headaches, motion-sickness etc. At the same time, Epic argued it's a tradeoff between various aspects they somehow have to balance, while not giving anyone an advantage over the other. 

As an example, they said they intent to minimize the potential for motion-sickness. Why does this take priority over, say, me getting headaches because of the default FOV of 80. I'm not responsible for someone's motion-sickness, nor is some else responsible for me getting headaches. Why do I have to (inb4 'you don't, just quit') \*suffer\* for someone else's condition or someone else for my condition? Why not have a set of fixed options that are relatively close to eachother and have the potential to make everyone happy and enjoy their gameplay experience? Wouldn't that be a healthier way to look at things, rather than being as restrictive?

&amp;#x200B;

My questions would be something along the lines of:

* Why does Epic insist on cross-platform play so much, when it comes with so many challenges that could be easily avoided?
* Why not have a set of fixed options for certain things like FOV, that might provide an advantage but are also relatively close to eachother so that the advantage is not as massive, while also making the game enjoyable for everyone?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm certain there's a more eloquent way to phrase this. Maybe someone gets the point I'm trying to make here and comes up with a better way to say this. Also, maybe I'm missing something. Thoughts? Highly appreciate your input.",FortniteCompetitive

The removal of the pump was unprecedented and completely changed the way we play the game, for the worse. 

I have two main issues with the meta: the shotguns and the drum gun.


Not only are the shotguns not fun to play with, but only the tac does enough as a shotgun close range. The combat doesn’t cut it nor does it have a flow that feels natural to the game. 

The drum gun has completely ruined the skill gap of box play and is a get out of jail free card for box aping, even after the nerf.

Now, the heavy shotgun requires more aim than the pump, does less damage and has more range. In other words it has the elements of the combat shotgun without the ""issues"", that epic had, with the pump. 

Solution: Add the heavy shotgun into the game, remove the drum gun or severely cap its clip size.

These are my two cents",FortniteCompetitive

After playing for about a week or two and getting back into the LCS you can just tell how many MILES behind EPIC are with their competitive scene.

They have the dorkiest / unrelatable casters that I think you could possibly find. The whole competitive integrity is upheld also by constant balance changes even while adding more champions. When you compare the two competitive scenes you can tell one is just for marketing and the other is a complete full competitive, balanced, and polished professional scene. My friends use to laugh at me when I told them Fortnite is ""competitive"" now I understand exactly why they would laugh.

On console, the aim assist only slows down the target and you don't have the locking in ability like pc. On PC it's totally different you can lock into targets by tapping L2 while you also have the slowing down ability, of course you need to adjust your aim with the thumbsticks but the problem is if you press L2 it locks into your enemy like an aimbot wherever on Console that's impossible. You can only get the locking in ability if you have good frames. The locking in mechanism is only affected by fps. You can also lock into people that are in shadow form on PC that you can't see (Clip will be in the comments}. We players need to know the difference between a console player and a controller on pc player.

**Summary:**

Aim assist is affected by fps and that's why console and pc aim assist is totally different. Aim assist on pc is multiple times better than it is on console. Please nerf the aim assist on pc like it is on console or you can buff console aim assist to what it is on pc so we controller players can have an even playing field.

I think that's it for major binds. Do these look good? I'm also wondering once I learn how to do 90s, will it be hard to do with E and Q since I won't be able to move with A/D?



Next is sensitivity. I've tried both, and I much prefer higher. I know people say 400dpi low sensitivity is best, but I really like my setup. I'm currently on 800 DPI with 0.140 X/Y. Is this ok or too much? And any suggestions on how to find a good ADS sens? 



Sorry if this is long, but I really want to get good with this. I appreciate any advice or tips, thank you!",FortniteCompetitive

I’m making this post for people that can’t seem to take a break or quit the game if they are losing interest. (I’m not making this a post about complaining in any sort)

If you ever feel drained from playing or aren’t having fun at all, I advise taking a break for a while. You don’t have to quit if you obviously still want to play, but taking a break makes it feel fresh again! Fortnite has honestly been my favorite game and no I don’t want to quit. I just want to make it clear that taking breaks from something that is draining is ok!",FortniteCompetitive

Why? Well, Arena has turned into a dumpster fire of a competitive mode. It doesn't even remotely resemble weekend tournament style play, and since the removal of the pump and addition of the slip streams, it's a w-key, 3rd party bonanza due to the massive time-to-kill this game now has. 

It's very clear that Epic wants to cater to the casual audience since that's their main source of income - *and that's fine, I get that.* But it seems like their idea of catering to the casual scene is by completely neglecting the competitive scene, and updating the game such that, in their minds, the casual game is more fun for everyone. This is where they couldn't be more wrong. 

Competitive players don't want to play pubs much. I didn't. But after the competitive scene has become so unbalanced, full of bugs, and the competitive mode has become complete shit, the only real option we have to have fun is to play pubs. 

So now we've come full circle, and the skill level in pubs is skyrocketing to siphon-era levels. Did anybody play pubs when Arena first came out? It was a bot-fest. I could get a 10 kill win playing with my pinky toe. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Competitive players will stay out of pubs if the game is properly balanced and we're given a proper competitive mode, but when we're deprived of that, we fall back on pubs, making them sweaty again.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Turn off the music. Obviously.

2. I would make it 2 lifes instead of 3. I think with 3 lifes early game would be too chaotic and YOLO.

3. Materials and ammo per kill.

4. Health and shield per kill ONLY on your last life.

5. If you die you lose a point.

6. If you win with two lifes you get double the victory points, so +6.

7. Bus fare like it is right now


I feel like the above settings allow for a greater array of strategies. Some examples:

- Player A is an aggressive player. He can play aggressive all game but in doing so he basically forfeits the double victory bonus. Without syphon on first life he will probably die one time early.

- Player B is an all around player. He can play aggressive on early game and passive late. Most players will be like this, allowing for more fun to watch early-mid game engagements while also keeping end game stacked.

- Player C is a passive player. He feels safer in late game. Compared to the other players he will probably end up with less kills but if he manages to execute his strategy and win with no deaths, he is rewarded with double victory points.


In conclusion, I think that Fortnite should allow for more strategies in competitive. Furthermore, each strategy MUST HAVE clear pros and cons.

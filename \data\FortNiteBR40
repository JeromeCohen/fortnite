Saying 90% weren't enjoying the game is a blatant lie but if true they need to show this data or do a poll in-game. If they said something like 50%-60% maybe I could see that but 90%?

I am one of the people that stopped playing after Epic removed the arena settings to normal playlists.

The solution to this issue is that many people want the update reverted:

  
Add a permament Siphon playlist of every mode (solo,duo,squad) without Arena points.

The people who wants to play without siphon settings plays normal pubs.

The people who wants to play WITH siphon settings plays this permanent siphon playlist.

They claim FOV will not be a thing because they try to avoid optional settings that provide a significant advantage.

*aim assist comes to mind, an optional setting that provides a significant advantage for controller players over those who do not use it.

*visual audio also comes to mind, this is an optional setting that provides a significant advantage being able to visually see the direction of sounds.

Minimizing potential motion sickness

*it has been scientifically proven that a higher FOV reduces the effects of motion sickness in gaming not the other way around.

I don't get why people are so upset about this. Its like watching a bunch of spoiled kids with no functioning brains whine about how they want their pony.


Epic is clearly are saying clearly that it affected engagement for 90% of the player base. 90 fucking %. If only 10% of the players stay engaged in the game the prize pool for the competitions plummet. The viewership on twitch will take a nose dive. Are you kidding me?


All of you people bitching and moaning are behaving like you cannot put a single thought together.


After they introduced the change both this sub and the main BR sub were filled with people complaining about how fucking hard the game had become. Even a popular streamer complained about it and his tweet went to the front page.  Also remember that most mid game during siphon/mats/farm+ was a desert. Giant circles with only a handful of people.  It sucked big time!  And people were complaining about it!  


And then Epic reverts the change and it triggers a memory wipe and everyone starts complaining? 


If 90% of the player base disengages from the game - it is bad for EVERYONE. This includes YOU.


If you liked siphon/mats/farm+ then go to ARENA! Its right there! On the same menu as the the regular mode. They didn't hide it. Its there in plain fucking sight.


Its like a pastry chef made a cake that everyone loved. Then one day decided to add more sugar to the cake. And 10% started buying more cake but 90% starting buying less cake. Then the chef starts making two cakes. One with the increased sugar and also the original one. And all the idiots in town start bitching about how they hate that their cake is gone. When its right fucking there. Right next to the original cake. Its so stupid!

The Siphon mechanic was meant for the game to be more fast paced and enjoyable, but the pro players took it too far. By killing everyone on sight, the “90%” as Epic claims, won’t be able to win, since they probably haven’t killed anyone, and meet up with someone who already has full health and shield. The 90% would keep dying over and over and over, due to the lack of skill compared to the competition they have with the 10%. And after all the deaths, the 90% won’t want to play Fortnite, leading to a huge loss in players. Epic’s perspective makes a lot of sense, to me at least, people just have to take time and think of it from a business standpoint. And you have to remember, Fortnite keeps growing in player base, and the 10% are the people who have been playing for the past year or two. The 90% will grow larger than the 10%, since the game even aims towards a kids/young teen demographic. Now I want you all to take a minute and think about what all has happened.",FortNiteBR

In the case of Fortnite I feel like if you have the skill of building &amp; aim that you should be rewarded and not given 50/50 instances of bloom. 

Some may say that you wouldn’t have enough time to build before getting killed. Simple fix is to lower the fire rate of the guns(Ar’s &amp; smg’s) giving you enough time to react and build appropriately 


So I conclusion make all guns in every game mode like the chitauri laser rifle to eliminate this stupid implementation of luck where it doesn’t need to be

Fix arena mode, lower mats cap, keep harvesting rate the same and vault gliders.","Let me start this by saying that I’ve definitely played more than a good chunk of the people here. I have a shit controller and play on WiFi so my stats aren’t as good as I’d like them to be but whatever. 

There’s no reason why my KD should be dropping from season to season. I had a 1.5 KD in solo games back in season 5-6 and now my KD is barely sitting at .90. By those stats you can tell that I’m an average player, probably no different from your average Joe. Still, getting rid of the shield siphon and letting everybody have 3000 mats during end game probably has something to do with why I currently suck. 

Still, I don’t care if we are given shield back per kill, I don’t believe that everybody should be playing aggressively anyways. What I do think we need is to bring back the 1500 materials cap AND keep the farming rate the same, while NOT giving mats per kill. This would not only mean that everybody would have less mats during the end game but by default, there would be less building and more strategy than to simply turbo build and turtle up every ten seconds. In other words, instead of pushing the farming rate back up to where you get 80 wood for a tree, keep it at 40 wood and make it so that people are still limited to the 1500 mats cap. 

To do all of this, epic needs to fix arena mode and give us a proper ranked system so I know to stay away from it lol. There’s no reason why I should be playing a casual game while somebody is sweating so hard to build the Burj Khalifa. You wanna sweat? Go to arena...except it’s not that simple, all of these folks are being capped at arena mode and go to regular mode because they’re no longer good enough. It sucks for them, because they’re not sweating against good competition and it sucks for me because I give up whenever somebody builds like crazy on me. 

Again, this game needs to slow down. It’s not as fast as it was when you were getting 12th party in arena but in regular mode, 12th partying just turns to 5th partying which is pretty much the same - or worse, if you’re not getting shield per kill. People are going to play aggressive no matter what core changes you bring up, the only way they don’t play as aggressive is if you severely limit their mobility. 

This leads me to my next point which is that gliders NEED to be vaulted. Honestly, have any of you gotten to the top 10 where at least 30% of the people have gliders? I guarantee that you’ll say yes and that it happens in virtually every solo game you play. We have he volcano and volcano vents, what’s the point in having gliders? It’s a get out of jail free card/free push on anybody who has some distance on you. It also means that unless you have gliders, you can’t build battle. What do you do if somebody builds 300 meters into the air and you can’t go after them because you don’t have the most convenient mobility item in the game? Guess I’ll just sit at the bottom of their tower and die lulz. 

At least with a rift to go - you can’t stack more than two which means you have to use them sparingly. Balloons make noise and don’t even get you very far. Impulses will damage you to fall damage. There is NO downside to using gliders besides sounds - which I would argue doesn’t matter much compared to the benefits it gives...not to mention that gliders are ridiculously common and you’ll probably find multiple sets every game. 

Appreciate you taking your time to read this. I understand that some of my ideas might be controversial but I’m hoping to get a discussion going. At the very least, I do believe that gliders need to go and the materials cap needs to be dropped. I doubt it’ll happen but it’s just way too easy to get from one side of the map to the other at this point. Not plane level bad but still really bad.",FortNiteBR

Ultimately, Siphon increased engagement for the highest-skilled 10%, while the remaining 90% were more frustrated and played less. 

Over time, players began to disengage in the core modes, stating that the game had gotten too intense to be enjoyable. The reduction in viable play styles in combination with this feedback was the basis of us removing the Siphon mechanic and the material changes from the core modes.]
———————————————————————
My Opinion: [Epic doesn’t get it. They keep thinking they are doing the right thing but they aren’t listening to the community. I personally think they should have 3 separate sets of play styles. 

1. Traditional fortnite: 999 material, no health per kill, more shield spawns, less time between storm movements for pace of play purposes.

2. Siphon: 500 material cap, health per kill, traditional lobbies and match making.

3. Arena: 500 material cap, health per kill, point system, skill based match making based off of points. Emphasis on competitive, tournament play. Changes to late game circles and pace of play

Lastly take out playground and creative from the Battle royal user interface and make it its own section like STW. Leave the LTM modes in the battle royal interface.]",FortNiteBR

I have never posted here before but after constantly seeing everyone on this sub ask for siphon back I wanted to post an opposing viewpoint. 

I have been playing Fortnite since season 4 and consider myself a pretty good player. I like the idea of getting rewarded for kills but I don’t think it worked as intended. For me, the game quickly became too difficult. I’m an above average player but can’t play as much as I used to due to school. During siphon, it felt like the amount of incredibly skilled players tripled. I stopped enjoying playing and actually switched to apex. 

Everyone in this sub wants siphon back and seems to not have the same experience of me. Maybe everyone here is better than me; I don’t know. 

Anyways, I guess my main point is that I think there is a large majority of players that play more casually that are not very vocal in this sub and Twitter. I think the decision to get rid of siphon was a good idea that the majority will benefit from. Ultimately I think siphon was driving away Fortnite’s core playerbase (casuals). I have recently been playing more and having siphon gone makes the game more filling for me!

I am here to describe a glitch I have been experiencing for a while, not to rant.  I just want a fix.  I have had my drops in arena towards ballers rendered useless by them self-destructing within tunnels in endgame.  It’s strange, when I am tunneling with a baller while hopping in and out of the vehicle it’ll sometimes shatter even at 200 hp.  I believe this is a glitch as the same issue never occurred with quads or planes.  I plan my storm rotations around having a baller so having it break randomly sort of makes it hard for me to continue my arena strategy.  Like I said I am not here to rant, just expressing what occurred so maybe this can be cleared or have a fix.

In order to fix this, Epic should change who becomes Thanos after the first Thanos dies. Normally, a random Chitauri would be chosen after the original Thanos died. Instead, the Chitauri that collected the second infinity stone should become Thanos. That way, even if you dont get the first stone, you still have a good chance of becoming Thanos if you get the second stone.

I feel like the players leaving the game upon realizing they are a chitari has become a slight problem with the LTM. Because of this, I’m going to make some suggestions to fix this. If by extremely small chance that an epic employee sees this, don’t take offence to this because I love this LTM and I don’t want to come off the wrong way.

Overwatch has a very good counter to when people leave matches in the middle of a game. From what I remember, after a few offences they are blocked from playing that game mode for a certain amount of time. I think that this would be a great counter to players leaving. If they purposefully leave after X time window from when the game started, they are reprimanded by not being able to play a battle Royale match for X amount of time.

Another but less effective way to counter this would be to take away experience points when someone purposefully leaves after X time window. Depending on how many offences in a row there are, the more exp is taken away each time.

I made a post on this a few days ago, but new information has come that could be leading to season 9, so here are my thoughts now:

There are three/four events going on right now: (I guess this isn't a thought, more of a fact)  
**Snobby Shores is being raided.** It will likely be taken over in Season 9 and be renamed to Viking Village.  
**Polar Peak is cracking.** I know it has only been in for 2 seasons, and if it is removed in season 9, it would be the POI that has been on the map for the least amount of time, but Risky Reels, Lazy Links, and Dusty Depot were only in for three seasons, so it could work out. Anyway, my theory is that the mountain will crack to a certain point, then the castle will collapse, and that last bit of pressure will cause the mountain to collapse. I'm guessing a small rock hill would remain and there would be a pretty huge flood. I think the snow around Happy Hamlet/Frosty Flights will melt, leaving the area just like the majority of the map. Frosty Flights would likely be renamed, just cant think of a name right now for it.  
**The volcano is smoking/Runes are appearing.** With each rune connecting to whatever is at Loot Lake, the volcano seems to become more active. This is HUGE. We already knew that the volcano would erupt, but somehow, these two locations are connected. I assume the volcano will erupt when the final rune connects to the thing in Loot Lake, but if it doesn't, something almost as insane will happen.

Alright, back to my point:

So I already said that I think we're going to lose Polar Peak and Snobby Shores. Along with that, there was a video showing &gt;!Tilted Towers and Retail Row after being smacked by the (most likely) volcano!&lt;. So it's likely we'll be losing plenty of POIs in the next season. Lazy Lagoon and Sunny Steps are brand new, and besides Leaky Lake, (which I don't count as an actual POI) no POI has been destroyed after one season. Also, keep in mind we only got 2 new POIs this season, so I doubt Epic would put three times the amount of effort in making new POIs as they did last season, if they were to be removed. So I think Sunny Steps and Lazy Lagoon will be in for more than one season, however, we have a very active volcano right next to them, so you never know. 

Along with that, I think The Block will move again. It moved last season, so I'm guessing it will move again. It's been on the coast both times, so it will probably stay on the coast, crushing either Lonely Lodge or Lucky Landing, two outdated and bad landing spots. However, I think Frosty Flights could be at risk too. Even though it has pretty good loot, the planes were vaulted last season, and it has become less and less relevant. However, I think it will stay in the game, just renamed at the start of season 9.

Besides the locations I've already mentioned, I think there are two other POIs that could be at risk for next season. I'll start with Dusty Divot. People have been saying from the beginning that the lava flow from the volcano will flood Dusty Divot by the end of the season. I don't think this will happen. If you go towards the end of the flow of lava, you will see that it starts to go north again, and stops at whatever the thing is around Tomato Temple. So unless there is a major lava flood, (possible due to the Floor Is Lava LTM) it won't be taken over, and if it is, we'll have bigger problems. Now I know the mining site at Dusty Divot created a small lava pool a few weeks ago, and while nothing has changed, I think Epic is the type of company that would save this kind of thing for the end of the season. I'm guessing the Divot will fill up with lava pretty soon, but I'm not sure what will happen after that. My original guess was that it would become a fiery battlefield, basically an extension of the lava flow near the volcano, but with everything else happening right now, I'm not sure if that will happen. I don't want to see Dusty go, it's my favorite landing spot along with Retail, &gt;!Again, RIP!&lt; but if it happens then it'll happen.

I think we've all seen the military prefabs in Creative, and it's a pretty big giveaway, not sure if this was intentional or not. Anyway, I think Loot Lake &gt;!Tilted and/or Retail could have these instead of/along with Loot Lake!&lt; could feature these POIs after it does whatever it is going to do.

Besides that, I think the volcano vents are going to have some trouble near the end of the season. They'll likely appear even more throughout the map, gain more pressure, or both. I also think that the eruption of the volcano will cause all of the vents to blow up, causing major damage throughout the map, especially around Lazy Lagoon, Sunny Steps, the calderas, that one broken house with a vent in the middle, and many other random places, like the ones at Paradise Palms.

So, these are just my thoughts. What do you think?",FortNiteBR

When you play as heroes, do NOT build around the infinity stones. You are only helping the Chitauris (hope it’s written like that), because the buildings can get destroyed in just a few seconds, and they can sneak up to take it without you seeing it.
But wait, you could tell me: « we stay around the stone so if they come they die! », well yes but actually no, because y’all in the same spot making you very vulnerable.

So the solution is: don’t build around the infinity stones and keep the zone clear of buildings and enemies by being far away. Btw this can help if you play as Thanos’ army: building can help.

Hope this was clear and not too complicated to understand. Thanks in advance.

It's also made more difficult by the fact that everyone knows this and a quarter of the team leaves as soon as they spawn in on the Chitauri side.

but does any of these weapon ever get a called for removal?..

no..

the community either scream..buff or nerf or rework..no remove..

and i know ok..i know..it not a br..but my point here is..

can we instead of vaulting a weapon that is weak in it current stat..buff it instead??..

like the tac..

my god does people dont have a brain here..the gun""s problem is clear..the spread make it so that it doesn't properly actually reward the player who hit multiple shot in short succession and the switch time is identical to pump

a clear enough suggestion should be made by people already:

1,buff it damage from 67/70/74 to 70/73/76

2,spread size reduced to green pump""s level

3,switch time down to 0.333 second

with all of these changes this gun will be actually viable..of course..no shotgun out there will be ever as viable as pump shotgun because of pump""s ability to 1 shot 100 hp player with body shot and 200 hp player with head shot(thus instantly ending a fight(potential)

and let me also remind you..

1,tac haven't receive a buff since the day they nerf it(even after 5.0..they nerfed the tac for double shotgun and now it gone..and the changes was made for tac wasnt reverted)

2,remember the infantry rifle?..that gun every single player other then few(who love Projectile N bulletdrop shooting model) scream vault it 24/7?..now that they have buffed it..no one complaint anymore..so why not give the same treatment for tac?..which is buff it not vault it.",FortNiteBR

By huge percent I mean its everywhere, they’re like robots bound to a soccer skin variant. Jokes aside its a real problem. 

I believe the reason behind fortnites issues is the extremely low skill gap. And no, I don’t only mean the shotgun “fix”, bloom, or any typical complaint. I think the game as a whole, including building if not especially, lacks in skill requirement. 

Now before you say “bUt bUilDinG-“, hear me out. Lets first adress combat. Combat in its simplest form is extremely basic. ARs have a simple pin point reticle and very little recoil, not hard to aim with at all once you’re the mildest bit warmed up. And bloom works to balance out between the marksman and the average shooter increasing the chances of the worse player by at least a little, in conclusion lowering the skill gap. Shotguns are beyond easy considering they’re longer range than most MP stats and the giant reticle. Snipers are an exception despite how frustrating it can be to be picked from your flank in the final circle so many times. And then of course there are deagles and pistols and rpgs which dont need explaining. Besides the extremely minimal recoil  of rifles, and range of shotguns, this games aiming mechanics wouldn’t be so bad, but the lack of options to throw you opponents aim off is why this easy shooter has such a low skill cap.  In lots of other 3rd person shooters, firing your weapon accurately isn’t a difficult task. But the truly good players can shine through the average who hit their shots just as well through other well placed game mechanics. For example advanced movement techniques and smooth corner/pop shotting options. Options that require frame perfect timing, technique, consistency, and intelligent application. Now again you’re probably gonna say “bUt bUilDinG!!!!!” Alright, ill adress that. 

Building really is the only aspect of fortnite that separates players and the gap of capability. 90% of people that play videogames have thumbs and can land a solid pump shot. But building isn’t good enough of a skill cap. In fact building is hardly a skill cap, its a speed cap. The number 1 way to put yourself above others in this game both literally and figuratively is to build faster, and faster, and faster. Bump that shit up to max sensitivity and practice your 1,2,3 key or button binds until you got it down. It’s simplistic. It looks absolutely crazy and impressive to anyone who doesnt play the game, and I think thats how we all felt before we learned to build but most of us caught one quickly didn’t we? Now we’re storming tilted with notorious tryhard skins building castles upon eachother relying on edits to get the kills. Most build battles no matter where you are or who it’s against go the same way and have a pattern to them. You approach them with your 90s or double ramps and rinse repeat the easy muscle memory. Editing and building doesnt take the advanced precision, advanced technique, frame pefect timing or placement that other mechanics in other games do. Its an easy 1,2,3 button order you take on at your own pace. Now don’t get me wrong speed and positioning are worthy skills! But what makes a multiplayer truly skill demanding and player expanding is a large variety of skills that require advanced mastering, more options for player creativity, and a variety of viable playstyles. In a build battle I mean sure it requires some awareness and you can get tricky with your edits but for the most part it follows a recipe, a science. Turtle at disadvantage or search for vulnerabilities if seated at high ground. Every build battle has a replicable pattern and all ‘pro’ players have and use the same predictable options in every fight because thats how fortnite and its building meta works. There aren’t many other options to shine with otherwise. I also feel the constant need for high ground, and walls to be yours crutches us fortnite players. The shooting and movement skill options are so minimal and limited, being below someone or at equal ground is such a high risk. Then headed into other multiplayers people arent used to fighting their way out of situations in spots where they don’t have a comfy advantage sitting atop a tower, or choosing when cover is available with edits getting cheeky premeditated shots. 

So if you want to be successful in this game go into playgrounds and practice building up quickly over and over and do some quick in and out edits. It might take a while but at least its simple, thats why basically everyone and their mother can do so in game. My matches are filled with spam builders and high ground junkies. I’ve stopped taking them all seriously. No one is significant anymore because everyone is “good” or as good this game allows. All you can do to push yourself higher up that ladder is become quicker. Little. Skill. Required. I mean seriously think about it, if building is that big a deal why can so many people do so proficiently. Clicking buttons isnt hard. And if you aren’t 80 you can improve your speed refelxes. 

Now if you want an example of a game I think has done a great job and making a large skill cap I recommend The Last of Us Remastered for PS4. Unlike fortnites building where you just have to click buttons in an order quickly. This game has a smoothe, balanced shooting mechanic with lots of variation between weapons. It also has the ability to swap shoulders making corner peaking not limited to only your right side. That and the movement options are incredible and the most advanced ones out there are so hard to master. They take moving your analog stick in an exact angle on an exact path on an exact timing while using two other buttons, but they let you to dogs bullets like the matrix! And unlike fortnite the competition between top players is more consistent amongst who has more mastery of more skills. No one in fortnite tournaments is a consistent champion of scrims or tournaments themselves because most players they play are nearly if nor exactly as capable as they are with maybe different preferences. This is because skill only goes so far in this game. As is the nature of Battle Royales, you gotta be in the right place at the right time. Its situational, and im okay with it. Thats how this game is supposed to be, for fun. Im just tired of the competitive credit it recieves.",FortNiteBR

Im not really sure, what topic this should be sorted to.... So ill get to the point. You know how the item shop changes every day in America, and in EU it changes at like 1 am 2 am 3 am etc.
Can you mayve consider, doing all EU players a favour by changing the time the itemshop changes. You could do this whith several servers. You could start like this:
NA: Daytime itemshop change
EU: Ealry in the morning itemshop change
Asia: (BLANK) I dont know
Brasil: (BLANK) I dont know
So basically every few months this will go up one. So basically it will look like this after the change:
EU: Daytime itemshop change
Asia: Early in the morning
Brasil: (BLANK) I dont know
NA: (BLANK) I dont know.

Rune one was actived by players pickaxing different""sub""-runes until they reached their designated locations.

#Rune two

The Second Rune has appeared above Loot Lake along with 3 lasers. Your job was to hit the lasers with your pickaxe to face the rune at Loot Lake. Everyone had to work together to try and split up between the 3 lasers to lock them in position.

* Lasers:

     * Volcano (Green).

If you've played End Game, you'll quickly see how unbalanced the game mode is. Heroes always win, villains always lose. Simple as that. It feels like it's not really even a challenge, it's just a giant farm-fest where heroes will just all group up on the last stone and no one can do anything on the villains side. Not to mention that Thanos isn't really THAT op or even dangerous since most heroes can evade him and laser him from long range.

IMO, heroes are given too much damage with their kits. Auto lock-on abilities that deal high damage compared to actually having to aim with low damage will always win because heroes will have a clear advantage. I'd work on tweaking things quickly because although the old Thanos game mode was great (and I'd gladly love to do it again), this one feels a bit too one-sided and boring.",FortNiteBR

Thanks again for all the recent Fortnite audio quality feedback, it’s much appreciated.  We’d like to share our plans for audio issue fixes and improvements going forward a few times each season.  Please feel free to point out areas of audio improvement and bugs to us in these threads; we’ll be reading and investigating what the community shares and report what we’re working on.  Here’s an overview of 

Release 8.5 Audio fixes and updates:

* “Random sounds” playing issue (‘ghost’ weapon switches, reloads, item use) fixed.

Release 8.5 open audio issues:

* Switch issues were more complex than anticipated, but we've dug in and have a speculative fix by v9.00

What we’re working on for the upcoming season:

* Better tactical audio when inside player-built structures:
   * Enemy Pickaxe impact within \~one building tile radius louder.
   * Wallbreak by enemy close/behind player much clearer/louder.
   * Hear the approach of enemy players outside player build structures.
* Better audio tells for jump/landing:
   * Jump tell audio added (so bunny-hopping isn’t as noiseless).
   * Clearer landing sound detection.
* Improvements to issues of sounds dropping outside of player FOV.
* Improvement of close versus distant player gliding sounds, to help clarify distance of gliding enemies.
* Bullet impact and explosive audio improvements- shorter, higher dynamic range sounds.
* Longer sounds properly playing during Replays.
* Fix for PC audio device swap issues.
* Improved differentiation of teammate versus enemy audio.

Last but not least, we are investigating ways to improve vertical and spatial audio in Fortnite.  We are actively working on a binaural/HRTF solution that will be a great help to headphone players, as well as other spatialization improvements.

As a reminder, the best way to inform us of your bugs is following the below format:

Here's how they could fix both of these problems.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shotgun Delay**

The reason why the shotgun delay is messing up the tac right now is that while your editing or sometimes you switch your weapons by accident you can get a 1-sec delay, and the tac shoots faster.

They could fix this by removing the shotgun delay and making it so you can only carry 1 shotgun, like how gliders work, and if you're saying that this would mean you can't carry a pump to your teammate, I don't think anyone has really ever had to carry a pump to there teammate since season 2-4 when double pumping was a thing and you usually carried 2 pumps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pullout Speed**

The tactical shotgun pullout speed is now the same as the pump (i think), making it almost useless because the tactical was originally had a lot faster pull-out speed. All epic would have to do to fix this is just changing the pull-out speed to match the old tactical shotgun, or just lower it a bit.",FortNiteBR

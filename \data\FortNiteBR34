So as you know, there was a poll in game. Notice how in every single perspective of a streamer, a normal player or literally anyone streaming or recording at the time, 80% of the people in their lobby was going for the drum gun. Now I know people do want the drum gun back, but I think it's a bit unrealistic that 80% in EVERYONE's lobby wants the drum gun back. I haven't seen one clip of majority of the lobby voting for something else(if you do, link it below or something). So yeah I might be wrong but it would just be a lot better if there was a normal poll online like on the epic games website. Please don't hate if you have something to say against this, you can reply and if I turn out to be wrong, Ill delete the post. Have a good day/night",FortNiteBR

Dear Fortnite,
So  today as you know there was an event that caused chaos. I find it very  unfair that half of us was not able to vote on this and we should have a  revote, also as it is an event that changes the whole state of the game  there should have been a whole week of time for the voting, this is  unfair on others that would like to vote but couldn't because they may  not have been at home at that time. I hate how you guys tweeted that if  the event glitched you would be able to view it on creative, however  this is unfair as who really wants  to do that, we want to participate  and we want to be heard.
So  the drum gun got unvaulted, I believe that the drum gun shouldn't have  even been an option to unvault. This affects the state of the game  hugely and in my opinion ruins the game play for everybody. When someone  has a drum gun theres little to no way of countering it as it just  straight up lasers, I find this very unfair and I believe the drum gun  should at least be nerfed. I know a lot of people that have quit and  rage quit fortnite today because of the decision to unvault drum gun and  more probably will over the upcoming days as with the drum gun you  cannot have fun anymore.
I  believe all guns that were vaulted should have been in the unvaulting  event as people have different opinions and maybe if there was other  guns then they could have been unvaulted as well and maybe even nerfed  if they were too op.  In the unvaulting event I feel that a option to  vote for siphon should also be allowed as you supposedly say you listen  to the community maybe see how many people hate siphon and how many  people find it fair. You guys stated that it encouraged agressive play  but siphon has been removed and I still feel as if there is a high  amount of agressive play in public matches. Also the materials boost  should not have been nerfed as you have to spend the whole game farming  materials to get maximum and then once your done maybe even end up dying  or use all of them in one build fight.

Thank you so much for your time.",FortNiteBR

While all doing Fortnite dances? These are the kids that have voted for the drum gun. 

If you don‚Äôt remember what the drum gun is, or just straight up don‚Äôt know what it is. It is a tommy gun, and think of it like a hybrid of the SMG and the assault rifles in this game.  It comes in the green/uncommon rarity, and the blue/rare rarity. It uses medium ammo. It does 26/27 damage, had 50 bullets in the clip, shoots 9 bullets a second, and reloads in 3 seconds. 

Let‚Äôs say someone is standing in front of you, point blank, (so that you‚Äôre guaranteed to hit every bullet), it would take 0.33 seconds to kill you‚Äôre target if you only hit body shots and they were 100hp. The drum gun has one of, if not, the fastest time to kill out of any of the guns that are currently in battle Royale 

The drum gun starts or damage drop off when it is 3.5 tiles away and if I recall correctly, that‚Äôs 3.5 floors away. It does 70% of the usual damage after 3.5 tiles, and then 55% of its damage 5.5 tiles away. I AM NOT 100% SURE ABOUT THIS. The information found in the past paragraphs, I have found from the Youtuber Flamm, but the wiki says this about damage drop off, whereas in Flamm‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat is the best SMG in Fortnite?‚Äù Video, he says other things. He says that at 4 floors away, the blue drumgun does 27 damage, 8 walls away, 20 damage, and then the falloff maxes out at 10 floors away, and does 17 damage. 

The reason why this gun was picked, is because it takes zero skill. Little Timmy can pick up a drum gun and absolutely shred through everyone if he has these. I remember using it, and easily shredding through everyone and their builds. The problem is, now that everyone is a lot better compared to season 4, the bots aren‚Äôt actually going to be able to do well. I‚Äôm sorry if you picked it because you wanted to finally be able to be able to play well in this game, but you‚Äôre actually going to do worse. Really good players are going to use the drum gun and absolutely beam everybody in their path. Why? Because you can do well with it even if you can barely play, put it into the hands of someone who genuinely knows how to play this game well, (has over 100 wins, can easily get kills, doesn‚Äôt panic in top 5 etc.), and you‚Äôre going to get destroyed with it. I remember back in season 4 when one of my friends (who doesn‚Äôt play anymore), was reallllly bad, but was easily just w keyying (on controller LUL) and consistently getting over 5 kills, which was s big achievement for him to be completely honest. 

The biggest problem is, is that this gun was vaulted instead of nerfed for a reason. Firstly, you can‚Äôt decrease the damage on this gun because it uses medium ammo, it is completely stupid to make it match an smgs damage when it uses bigger bullets. It is stupid to reduce the clip size because it is a tommy gun and it HAS to have 59 billets in it. The fire rate currently isn‚Äôt even that high, the gun will feel incredibly clunky if the fire rate was decreased. Also, reload speed can‚Äôt really be increased either, because that would also make the gun feel clunky. Damage falloff can‚Äôt really be reduced as, once again, it uses medium ammo. It genuinely does not make sense to make the gun do the same damage as an SMG. There is really nothing Epic can do to nerf this gun, even though it desperately needs one. This gun is going to destroy Fortnite even more.

TL;DR: The drum gun is an ar/smg hybrid, it‚Äôs stupidly overpowered, it can‚Äôt really be nerfed, bots are gonna get destroyed, bye bye Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

So, i missed the unvault event, but it was not necesary to participate to know that almost everyone would have chosen the drum gun (which is extremely overpowered) to come back to the game. I'm holding back tears right now, because some reasons that im about to tell you:

1: My personal experience with the drum gun

At first, when it was added, i didn't really care for it. I tought it would be another weapon for more variety in the game, such as the hunting rifle, infantry rifle, silenced pistol, scoped revolver, double barrel shotgun, silenced sniper, etc. notice how all of them except the double barrel shotgun are still in the game? thats because everyone started using it, just like the drum gun. I have lost real life friends and friends made in the game for the mere existence of the game because thats tyhe only thing they would use in 1v1's. you do NOT know how happy i was when they vaulted it.

2: Over use

When it was first added, and people strated noticing how powerful it was, they started spamming it. you can literaly find videos of people using 3 or 4 drum guns at a time (just like it happened to the p90) and after seeing that, i don¬¥t remember a single nerf they had done to the drum gun. They just took it out like POOF (i dont have a very good memory, so if this WAS indeed the case, i'll apreciate feedbacks)

&amp;#x200B;

3: The ""civil war"" over the gun and the community overall

OK, so, when the drum gun was at its peak, people were arguing about it: if it should stay or not, if it should be nerfed or not, if it should be more rare to find or not, etc. and once it was gone, the same, but this time, ""should it come back nerfed or just how it was?"" ""should we accept that it's gone or not?"" ""Should boulding get buffed to counter it?"" etc. besides, a lot of people were toxic towards me and a lot of other players, and i don't want that to happen to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you will say ""accept that it's back"" or ""if you don't like it, stop playing""

to the frist one, i will have if this message doesnt get attention. to the second one, no. i love and enjoy this game, and try to have fun everyday, so please, feck in hell

&amp;#x200B;

sincerely yours, a fellow player",FortNiteBR

There‚Äôs no point of even playing with this gun in the game because the enemy player can spend 5 minutes constantly spraying your builds and can consistently nail shots because of how OP it is.

You can‚Äôt even have one second to box yourself in and drink a mini. The gun will literally kill you no matter how fast you build.

Every single item that could be chosen was controversial. No matter which item the community picked, you would have complained.

Bouncers - Sure, they're fun, but within a few weeks they will be used significantly less.
Grapplers - Makes getting high ground easy. But so did the Jetpack and no one complained about that.
Infinity Blade - Do we really need to go this? The game was unplayable when it was in the game. Good in an LTM, not in the standard modes
Planes - The pro's would quit Fortnite. Epic would lose profits. Sure they were really fun in Air Royale, but it's best that they stay in an LTM.
Tac SMG - Honestly this is just the weaker P90. The P90 has more quality of life changes. It has more ammo, it does more damage. The only reason people want this back is because of nostalgia.

I don't care if you down vote me to hell. I couldn't care less. I'm just telling the truth. But some people can't handle the truth.

Usually when Epic adds or removes a new feature to the game, either the casual playerbase or the more serious playerbase suffers somewhat. If something was implemented that benefited the hard-core playerbase, the feature would be deemed ""sweaty."" Likewise, if a feature was implemented that helped the less-skilled players, the hard-cores would consider it a game-breaking and an unfair aid to other players.  

It seemed that one side of the Fortnite fan base  would be unfairly catered for with each update,   while the other would be pushed aside,  which makes the idea of a vote an excellent concept. 

The Drum Gun was voted to be brought back by the playerbase to an overwhelming degree. The fans have spoken. To those of you saying that less-skilled players shouldn't have had votes because they ""don't understand"" the game, you don't seem to understand how democracy works. 

The Drum Gun won via popular vote. The majority of the fan base wanted it back in the game. Everyone casted their vote and the Drum Gun won. You weren't screwed over; your personal vote was simply defeated in a democratic election of sorts.  I'll admit, if it was up to me personally, it wouldn't be in the game.

now, you may ask, ""Why should that come back instead of Bouncers or the sword?""

simple; it's something with no current equivalent in-game, and it changes gameplay in a big way. planes and Grapplers are obsolete with the Baller around, the sword is impossible to make balanced (it's either utter trash or an instant win), Bouncers are just wall-Impulses (plus if you need them to negate fall damage... you're just bad, and that comes from the biggest bot known to man), and the Tac SMG is just a weaker version of the Compact.

the Drum Gun CHANGES the meta. it makes people THINK about how they attack and build. it also doesn't entirely rework the game.

yes, the Drum Gun is the current best mid-to-close-range weapon. but why complain about that and not also, say, the Boom Bow, which is incredibly overpowered at a long range? it's Baby's First Sniper; uses more common ammo, reloads faster, LITERALLY TELLS YOU WHERE THE SHOT WILL LAND, one-shots people on a body or headshot, and does explosive damage to structures.

Which many people will find fine, but there is a reason that it was vaulted. Though we have definitely moved from the "" Spray and Pray"" meta, (which was a bunch of things in Season 5, not just the Drumgun) there is an actual issue with the gun's high DPS. 

Despite that, I don't want the Drumgun to leave.

I want it to be **FIXED.**

We really shouldn't have this culture of ""remove this"" having to actually fight with ""keep it it's fun""That causes a split in casual and hardcore, which is poor for **ANY** game trying to have a competitive ecosystem.

Epic has run out of ideas and is now just doing random stuff.,"I watched the event.  Unlike others it worked for me.  The buildup was great.  The visuals of the event were great.  But the value of the event was zero. 

Why is a game balancing mechanic part of the story line now?  Is the next thing the vault will allow us to vote on is the spawn rate of mini sheilds?  The whole contraption was super cool but the value behind it was nothing. 

What did the vault have to do with a volcano?

It was like Epic had no good ideas and two people argued about the terrible options they had and they decided to do both.

The whole ""everyone participates in the event"" meta is just dumb.  Dont include people in the storyline.  Actually have a story.  

I can't explain it but I feel less interested in playing.  Its like the mystery is completely gone and what I imagined was a mystery behind the world is just a poorly coordinated event. 

Im a big fan of fortnite.  Im just so disappointed.

Because some 3 year olds complain that too many people land there? Junk has been the worst spot for so long and now those kids could land there and get their 5 grey ARs. Honestly what was the problem with tilted and retail. That too many people landed there, well play team rumble.

Why would they bring drum guns back?

I know it‚Äôs the community‚Äôs choice but why would they make it an option? They could‚Äôve brought the bolt back or ANY OTHER OPTION because it seems like the only people voting were 7 year olds who like to ‚Äúdrum gun only‚Äù. 

Removed all Competitive Aspects:
- arena is no longer a mode for some reason

- now we have ABSOLUTELY NO siphon in any mode

- spray and pray meta is back

===================================

Rule 1: No killing. This should seem obvious but I just wanted to clarify. If you want to get an angle where there is already someone else there, approach them with either your pickaxe or building map in hand.

Rule 2: Voting. In this event it seems we as a community will be able to bring back ONE item from the vault. So in order to not waste a vote, we must all agree to vote on one of two things; The Drum gun, or the Tactical SMG. That way we can ensure no trolls will be able to sneak planes or *god forbid* the sword back into the game.

Rule 3: Be ready at all times. Fortify your viewing area with walls, and don't leave yourself unarmed. Try and get away from the crowd so you don't get caught up in as much drama.

Rule 4: Emoting. Emoting can help differentiate yourself from foe's to an innocent player. But don't let your guard down. Be careful when approaching another player. Some people want to view the event only for themselves and will gladly kill others without hesitation and still watch the event.

From @ShiinaBR on Twitter, they have found out that all playlists will be disabled at 2:35 EDT, for us Brits it‚Äôs at 7:35 BST, other regions include 9pm CET, 12pm PST and 20th January 7am AEDT. For any other regions use a time converter. All playlists will then return 4 minutes after the event has started. 

From a PlayStation Event post made by Epic Games, the Event is going to be in a time frame of 10 minutes. This does not mean that it‚Äôll last that long but it will likely be a bit longer than the Cube event.

I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the event but do beware if you want a fresh perspective as I will explain why you want to be in certain places.

Start of the event, BE AT LOOT LAKE. Killing is probably going to be turned off 1 minute before the event and I‚Äôm guessing respawns are on. Flashy stuff will happen and eventually we believe that we will be voting on one of 6 items to unvault. The Stormwing, the Infinity Blade, the Grappler, the Bouncers, the Tactical Submachine Gun and the Drum Gun. I and the majority of content creators recommend the Bouncers or the Tactical SMG because the rest either have balance changes or would be very boring as an event item. The rest of the Vault stuff is not known.

*EXTRA NOTE: LOOT LAKE‚ÄôS VAULT VOTING COULD ALSO BE INSIDE THE HATCH. IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN YOU WONT NEED THIS NEXT STEP AS YOU WILL PROBABLY BE SENT IN THE AIR WITH YOUR GLIDER.*

It is likely that next the volcano will erupt, maybe when the Vault voting period has been finished, get up to a place where you can see well. I recommend the mountain West of Loot Lake on the map. This will give you a good view without having to travel far.

That‚Äôs all we know so far. Sorry if it‚Äôs vague but we don‚Äôt know much.",FortNiteBR

For some reason, when I try to record or stream while playing, I got some crazy glitches every game where buildings and sometimes other stuff (skin, pickaxe, weapons, enemies...) do not load, making the game unplayable.

The weird thing about it, is I still get ~140fps even if nothing loads, and when I check the recording or stream there is no skipped frames.

When I don‚Äôt stream or record I don‚Äôt have this problem.

Tried to switch the encoder from AMD to x264, lowered the bitrate from 5000 to 2500, updated GPU drivers, but nothing worked.

The other smg the tac smg: Is not a bad gun, but we already have two smgs with light ammo and one of them has 30 bullets and shoots fast as hell and the other 40 bullets and shoots even more fast, thats why my vote will not go to the tac smg.

Grappler and bouncers: We have plenty mobility items in the game right now and probs more will come thats why i dont think these two are needed so im not voting for them.

X4-Stormwings: I love planes but i need to admit that the stormwing was broken and if it were to be unvaulted it would receive so many nerfs that it would most likely become an X2-stormwing and probably get vaulted again.

Infinity blade: it is fun to use, but only one player can have it and people would get mad by dying to it so it probably would get vaulted again.

So at last Drum gun: it is another smg of green and blue rarity which can become an intermedium between the compact and silenced as it has similar fire rate to the silenced and the same ammo as the compact and also uses medium ammo.

This is my opinion and i don‚Äôt expect you to like it but at least respect it. Pls.",FortNiteBR

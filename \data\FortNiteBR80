Hybrid skin is very underwhelming. Especially since his ninja outfit literally looks like the bucket fill option on paint. No depth no pizazz. On top of that... orange and green being the color scheme of this battle pass is just yuck. Not sure why stereotypical pumpkin was the go to for this season but it is. The real kick in the vbucks is the tier 100 skin.... like are we serious? That is literally the most underwhelming pile of jank ever. The hip hop girl should have been one of the opening skins and black heart should definitely be where she is. Last but not least the calamity white girl that they added some snakes to..... talk about running out of ideas. Overall the battle pass is just super disappointing. That being said. I think the island looks great. The volcano and new locations are super fun. I’m also really enjoying the cannons even though they massacred my boy x-4 (which was stupid y’all just need to get good). This tropical theme really appeals to me being from a warmer part of the U.S , and the umbrella this season is magnificent! Conclusion. Season 8 is definitely the weakest season we have had so far, but at least the island looks cool. ",FortNiteBR

A casual player shouldn’t be getting into lobbies with nerds who dedicate their life to this game. 

And before you say “get good” or “stop hating on players better that you” I’m not even that bad at the game, I had a 2kd in solos over the last couple of seasons - and even I, who’s probably a slightly above average player is starting to get really frustrated with the skill gap in this game. I only play a few hours a week and when I do play in the limited time I have I don’t want to have to dedicate half of it to practicing aim and edit courses just to get a few kills in solos. I have a life outside of fortnite and don’t want to dedicate my life to it to have fun playing it. 

Its unfair that players who hardly play are getting matched against others who practice way more, epic you really need to sort some sort of ranked mode because its already obvious that casual players have stop bothering with fortnite based on the amount of sweats I’ve been encountering in my lobby the last couple of days. I was really excited to play season 8 after having a few weeks off but I’ve come back and the game just isn’t fun anymore. 

Im not hating on good players, I just think that you should be matched with players with similar skill to you or a 24/7 ranked mode for the sweaties to play, otherwise I can see the player base dropping down massively over the next couple of months. ",FortNiteBR

Not even 2 seconds after I reached the vent, a soccer skin was running into the storm to try to shoot me out of the sky. So I landed after taking about 80 damage and literally right after I land he comes gliding on top of me and he gets killed. Now after he dies, I’m not even close to the spawn circle and sure enough he spawns and glides right back on me and I end up killing him again. He tried the same thing like twice more.

This one is particular takes it to a whole new level. I’ve noticed that people here don’t like it when you say something critical or even in the slightest bit negative about fortnite. If you do, they attack in numbers calling you trash or calling you a number of names that I’m surprised are allowed on this sub. I’ll probably get instantly downvoted  just for bringing it up. 

To anyone participating in this toxicity, I wonder if you have ever stopped to think why people hate this game so much. People hate this game because of the community. The community is so toxic if you saying anything bad about this game whether it’s suggesting balance changes or just sharing opinions about the game. 
I remember suggesting that planes should be removed a while back and I got BOMBARDED with comments saying, “You are just bad, shut up loser 😂😂.” or “Just shut up. Nobody cares.”  I would get comments along those lines. Then right when season 8 dropped and epic removed planes, everyone who hated on me were ecstatic that planes were gone. The hypocrisy was real. I think mods need to be a bit more proactive on this sub because it’s getting ridiculous.",FortNiteBR

Besides, I would far rather wait a few minutes to get into a duos game than not have that option at assll.

If you are fighting one of the enemies duo if you knock them instead of right away finishing them they can get eternity five shield to fight the other duo and not be one shot. I have been in multiple encounters when I was solo duoing and i knock one of them but i’m low and i have to fight the other one. This also fits in for squads.

The game is just a mess, many casual players quitting because of how sweaty the game is now. No new players are joining anymore, and streamers are as well losing interest. Not even ranked or SBMM is implemented in yet. The game has many problems that haven’t been solved. 

Season 8 is one of the most important seasons, and day one I don’t think it’s gonna get any better from here on out. No ranked at all and not even that many changes besides map changes. Season 8 will determine if the playerbase will want to stay and play or to quit and find a new game to play.

""Season 8 battle pass""

Yeah, it was free for a limited time and yeah, I think Blackbeard should've been tier 100 but still. Why is this season's battle pass getting a ton (and I mean a TON) of flack? I'll let you in on my perspective on this; picture a player who only started playing fortnite early February and who enjoyed it. Now picture eyeing the store but having no income whatsoever to spend on games on such even though you'd love to get just ""one"" cool looking item. Now imagine how stocked I was when I learned Epic was going to allow it's playerbase to WORK for something usually worth money.

I was absolutely excited! Doing these challenges not only would reward me for my effort but it also let me get pretty good at the game too. Season 8 rolls around and I activate the free version of the battlepass, now I'm no longer forever stuck with default skins, awesome!

Here's the thing, why do people hate it SO much? Is it because it was free or did it not live up to their expectations? I can't fathom why because I'm still very new to the game.

A plea to Epic Games...,"Sometime way back in Season 2, I told my friends that I think Fortnite might be the single greatest game of all time.  They scoffed at the notion, but I was serious.  ""It's a PUBG rip off!  What can you possibly see in that cheap kids game?!""  Keep in mind, these were the same friends I played GoldenEye, Halo, Unreal Tournament, Call of Duty, and Counter Strike with.  We steeped in the genre of competitive multiplayer games together.

My response was simple.

""I've never played a game with nearly the amount of diverse, tactical, lengthy gunfights that Fortnite provides.  Nothing comes remotely close.""

I would tell them about specific fights I had where me and a single opponent would engage in 3+ minute wars, where he and I would try to use a vast array of tools to get a leg up on each other.  The building and the crazy items synergized in such a way that I could never go back to the basic run n gun games of my past.  I had never played a game where I could enjoy losing a fight as much as I could in Fortnite.  Competitive shooters could no longer be about who had the better aim and the faster reflexes.  They now had to be about positioning, timing, resource management and quick thinking.  Fortnite was the next step in the evolutionary chart.

Fast forward to today.  

Now this is happening all too often...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VqOR15KiB9c

The battle pass would drop, and I would look at the new skins and get stoked to unlock them.  This battle pass dropped, free because of the overtime challenges, and truth is I barely give a shit. Objectively, a lot of the skins in this battle pass are cooler than the skins from previous battle passes. But it's the same overwhelming feel of same shit different day. Grind this to unlock more cosmetics, which if you've been playing enough, have been piling up and law of diminishing returns is in full effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing to address the ranked or competitive mode that more and more people have been asking for for a while now. Wouldn't that go farther to giving this game longevity than just throwing more skins/emotes/contrails at us?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not all bad. No more planes -- great. Hoverboards -- fun. Heal on kill -- great, and it supports aggressive play. But at the end of the day, it's basically a game of looting, harvesting, and donating all the shit you got to the first streamer you see in the end game. Team rumble is about the only game mode that's fun anymore, because even when you get wrecked, you can at least jump back in and not bother tediously harvesting shit all over again. It also doubles as a convenient way to knock out the daily challenges.

For new or bad players, here’s a tip: don’t fucking storm push when we’re on the other side of where circle is closing in. “Oh but what about health per kill??” No, you’re literally throwing by trying to initiate a build battle in storm, or trying to wall replace/ wall spam while we’re stuck in zone.

Same thing goes with the pinging system, people complain that Fortnite is copying Apex. People need to realize that many games have that feature and I bet Fortnite was already planning something along these lines long before Apex was a thing. Finally, people that say ""Fortnite is a dead game"" obviously need to do some research before saying that considering Fortnite just hit a record amount of concurrent players on a non-event day just a few weeks ago.

I don't have a problem with full killing an enemy if they get caught out or outplayed, that's the point of the game. What I'm tired of is players immediately trying to thirst, despite 3 players out a squad bombarding them. I wish I would have clipped it, but I had someone a few games ago get knocked from FALL DAMAGE because he/she was trying to full kill a squad member of mine. We weren't shooting them, we weren't even close to them. They had ample time to build down and finish my squad mate, but instead let their greed screw it up. What is with this kamikaze mentality? If I'm mid fight and knock someone, I box them in so they can't do anything while I continue to fight. It's simple. Not to mention, if you're THAT low on resources, should you have been fighting to begin with? I'll full kill someone if their squad or duo isn't with them or isn't trying to shoot me, so that's not what I mean. I know this has been talked about before, but it's still an issue that irks me a lot. Does anyone feel that way? I'm open minded, and want to hear what people think about this. By that, I mean a serious discussion. Any ""git gud""s are going to be downvoted into oblivion.

If you simply google ""No female tier 100 skin fortnite"" you will get a decent list of people complaining about it. Now we know that EPIC takes a very long time for even 1 skin, and it's very likely that they plan and design skins for like 2 seasons ahead. So they had a battle pass planned, and Luxe was tier 1 and blackheart tier 100, but they had to give in to the complaints because at some point you might get some angry people, so they just swapped them around. Did it really matter though? You still get the same skins, just in a different(Better) order, and people who really wanted a female skin to be tier 100 are somewhat satisfied as well. Everybody wins, and who knows.. Maybe we get something like the prisoner for Luxe as well. ",FortNiteBR

They did this for two weeks until the controversy grew to such a fever pitch that it was finally removed.  

What was so interesting though was the split itself.  The high skill level community generally liked glider re-deploy whereas the casual, low skill community hated it.  Pro players could regularly drop 20 bombs during pub matches because traveling was so fast and cheap.

I think we're on the same path with the health per kill mechanic that Epic added three weeks ago.  Many people are already seeing more high kill players in their lobbies.  At a certain point, once the top 5 - 10 players in each lobby get a certain number of total kills (on average) the casual player base will begin to voice their displeasure/quit.

I think we're going to start seeing more and more complaints from people in the next few weeks, until something has to be done.

On top of that, many (but not all) of the ziplines are gone as well. Add in the fact that planes were vaulted, and there are very few options for making rotations in most of the outer parts of the map. Places like Viking, Frosty, Lucky, Mexico, Haunted, etc. are not nearly as viable as they were before.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that makes this weird is that in the new jungle biome, the volcanic vents &amp; ziplines are everywhere, and you can literally fly around the entire biome without your feet ever touching the ground once you learn the layout. If you hit the vent by Dusty on your way out, you can go all the way from the east side of the volcano to Tilted in a matter of seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

So at the end of the day, you have 3/4 of the map that will be legging it quite a bit this season, while the other 1/4 of the map will be able to make any rotation with ease. It almost feels like Epic missed something with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, I really liked the map changes for Season 8, but the lack of mobility really has me bummed, especially since it pretty much killed all of my drops for Pop Up Cups.

RNG - everything in the game is based mostly on the roll of the dice. The circle. Your loot. Weapon spread (it's not called bloom and in no game ever has it been called bloom so stop using this term, bloom in gaming has a much different meaning).

Building mechanic - the only thing that separates it from the rest of this BR genre makes it even worse. Building promotes senseless playstyles that impress people who don't know what they are watching because the builder himself has no idea what he's doing. Picture two equally skilled players fighting each other in Fortnite: who wins? Not the one with the best aim, but the one with more resources to spam (and yes, it's spamming). Cool.

Terrible server tickrate - everyone seems to forget that this game runs at 20 tickrate at it's best. This should be resoundly ridiculed and laughed at.

Third person - the perspective matters a lot in shooters, especially PVP shooters. First person forces the game into a battle of choices, careful positioning, risk vs reward. Third person removes all of that, since your eyeballs are not in your player character but inside an invisible floating character that sits 5 feet above and behind you. Don't have to poke your head to see that player rushing you, your camera can! Great game mechanic for campers and gives an enormous defensive advantage to those that randomly get the circle.

Micro transactions - need I say more?

Skill - or lack thereof. Most of the skill involved in this game revolves around building and trashing players who should never have ended up in the same queue as you to begin with - mostly mobile and console players and the squad of screechers (10 year olds). Watch the top players compete and you will see the game for what it really is - an incredibly slow paced deathmatch with nothing interesting going for it.

This game is only popular because it is incredibly casual-minded and because it is free. It caters to a large audience of kids and teenagers. It has hit all the right buttons to be popular, but missed all the buttons to make it a good game.",FortNiteBR

I know what you're thinking... Oh God, another Theory post. HARD PASS! Yea, I get it. Been there done that, so if you don't want to read, feel free to pass. Now, this is probably going to get pretty long, and so I'll TRY to keep it short as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done a lot of digging around and theorizing, so the best way I can start this I think is to explain a common theme among all the seasons (This excludes Season 1, since there was no real battle pass.) So, let's get this first part out of the way. Every season there are 3 distinct characters that are introduced. The Tier 1 Skin, The Tier 100 (or 70 if you look at season 2 which only had 70 tiers) and the Secret Skin which could be unlocked by doing so many challenges within a season. Tier 1, I have found to commonly be the HERO of the story. Follow me here. Tier 100 has commonly been the Antagonist of the story. And the Secret skin has usually been in the background, helping the players and moving the story along. All 3 are important. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning, there were the Knights. I'd like to think they were native to the land but they could just be the survivors of Season 1 who organized. The Antagonist of Season 2 was the Black Knight, a ""Scourge of Wailing Woods"" as is described, who has a symbol of a Fire Breathing Dragon on it's back. That's important to note. As Season 2 comes to an end, it is likely to assume the the Dark Knight has been ran off, and Wailing Woods is left without it's Scourge. 

&amp;#x200B;

Season 3 opens and here come visitors from another planet! Good Ole Astronaut Jonesy is on the case to discover this new world and learn it's secrets. But he is not alone. For the Mercenary, Code Name Reaper has arrived as well, though it's hard to tell his intentions, but as a merciless killer, it's probably not good. My best guess is that he is trying to cut off someone else who would be arriving soon, so that he could kill them, but all these damn astronauts are in the way. Regardless, the Astronauts do a solid job at inhabiting the island and this new world.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 4 begins as a Comet comes headed for the DUSTY DIVOT! With the arrival of the comet, comes the classic tale of Super Heroes who gain their abilities from a rock of unknown origin. Our Hero Carbide arrives on scene. But no hero is complete without a villain. The story for season 4 is still a little sketch to me. The whole movie thing is just weird... If anyone has ideas on this, let me know. But this part I guess isn't super vital to the story. What's vital to the story, as I've said before is the Secret Skin... which pushes the story on. So Meanwhile, we have this strange rock and who better to dig it out than former astronauts! And thus the Visitor arrives on the scene. This is where things start to get more interesting. The visitor can seem a bit villainy, but I believe that's the opposite of the case. I think he actually knows what's going to happen. It is possible that he's from the future. And thus a true hero to this story, as he predicts the arrival of a Great Evil. Kevin, as we've so fondly called him. But he knows that we can't beat this evil on our own. Perhaps, coming from another timeline, he's experienced this himself... thus, he creates the possibility that Heroes from other worlds could come and help in the fight.

&amp;#x200B;

So, Season 5 launches and so does the rocket. A kid by the name of Drift shows up, and he meets the wonderful colorful people of this world. We see Rainbow Bomber showing him around along with much of the other crew. But opening up the portals for the worlds to collide has other consequences. Ragnarok has arrived, A Harbinger of Fate.  A person or thing that [f](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/foreshadow)oreshadows or foretells the coming of someone or something. It is both possible that Ragnarok is foretelling Kevin, but I think it's also possible that his arrival foretells The Ice King. Either way, the day comes where The Visitor's plan comes full circle and Kevin arrives. Kevin as we like to fondly remember him... IS A BEING OF PURE DARKNESS! His only object is to drain the world of it's energy and leave his darkness in it's wake. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll not that I'm pretty sure the Enforcers were there to try and prevent Kevin from happening. They are beings bent on creating balance after all.

And we have season 6, which creates all this darkness in the world. Who to fight the darkness but a Huntress by the name of Calamity. Calamity seeks to destroy all this evil brought into the world, including vampires... and WEREWOLVES! Someone has to save poor Red. But, defeating Kevin's army of darkness put a stop to all that when the gang finally destroy the Nightmares and Kevin. Kevin being released, releases the good energies that he's drained and thus our butterfly moment and the rainbow. 

Meanwhile, we have this hidden outpost over by wailing, researching Lord knows what... I bet Black Night knows... \*Hint\* A Dragon. This game is so cleverly full of foreshadowing, in not just the battlepasses but the story as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come Season 7. The Ice King Arrives, and attempts to claim this power of darkness for himself so that he can conquer all things! But, an unexpected Hero is right around the corner. Zenith, the man with the plan. The Ice king uses the powers from what remains of the cube to create his own version of the nightmares... Ice Fiends and floods the land under snow. Our heroes fight off the fiends, while our unexpected hero... the man with the firey torch pickaxe goes to free a prisoner inside the Ice King's lair whom he believes might be able to help against the ice King. And The Prisoner is released!

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Season 8. The title is X marks the spot. The Prisoner has escaped on retreated to Wailing to find the only thing he could think could help save the world from The Ice King. A DRAGON! So, he retreats with dragon eggs and goes to wailing woods, which hides the volcano and home to the dragons. (Wailing woods.... black knight... are you seeing the pattern????) However, to get a dragon on your side... you need to gain it's trust. And the only way to gain a dragon's trust in the lore, is to bring it treasures! The King, having lost his last battle seeks more power, and also seeks treasure. And our unknowing Hero, the Pirate... being a pirate.. also seeks this treasure. So, here we are. 3 groups of people, all seeking the treasure. (Wait, hold up... I thought you were going to tell us the Secrets of Luxe!?) Oh, my friend.. I am getting there.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Luxe seems to be quite the crappy tier 100 skin. I'm sure a lot of you can agree on that. But, it is also my believe that Luxe ""expensive and of high quality; luxurious."" who's final form is Gold, seems to be increasingly driven by treasure. Who is driven more by treasure, than that of A DRAGON! who hoards it. This is indicated by the battle pass spray of her surrounded by a dragon and the dragon on her arm, not to mention her obvious lust for gold and her shiny backbling. I believe as the season progresses and she gets more gold, she beings increasingly giving of her abilities and thus her ninja buddies helping The Prisoner are able to achieve somewhat Draconian states. But.. they are ALL still looking for the treasure that is going to change the tide of the battle. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Battle Pass also hints at the return of The Getaway LTM. With the Shiny llama treasures. However, with this season, I think the getaway will be a little different. And this will lead up to the season event in which one or more of these groups finds the treasure they are looking for. The Event giving Luxe possibly, her nice shiny armor design that she deserves. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as where she came from, I'm not quite certain if she was in the volcano and is the mother to the eggs, or if she came from the eggs herself. That has yet to be seen, but it's something I'm pondering on, and will continue to ponder on as seasons progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then moving forwards, I believe the Dragon has her own intentions, because she is the main antagonist after all. I believe an epic battle between fire and Ice will result in an aquatic theme, where the pirate might step up and save the day, also hinted at in the battle pass for Season 9 with all the aquatic animal banners.  


There's probably a whole lot more I can get into, but for the sake of time and trying to write this post for you in a way that I think everyone can kind of understand, I'll just stick to those details. I think this season is gonna be great. There's a lot of potential here for some great events. We'll see how it unfolds together! 

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely let me know what you think! If you have some other ideas. I'm also down to do some theory crafting, and another perspective always helps!!!! ",FortNiteBR

First offence gets a warning. Second gets a 24 hour ban. Third gets the Soccer Skin removed from their locker. Fourth means they can receive damage and be killed while on spawn island. And so on.

The game is simply not fun when you have no chance at killing these types of players.  Way too frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

Today i was really hyped to play season 8 so i was waiting for the servers to go up after the update.

After they got online i couldn't click launch Fortnite so i decided to restart the Epic Games Launcher.

When i started it back up i couldn't log on it kept saying something like ''You seem to be experiencing network connectivity issues'' So what i thought, is that it was because the new season just started and the servers were overloaded. But like 9 hours later now and i still cant login. It keeps giving me network errors like AS-3 and the one stated above. Its really frustrating cause all my friends are playing the new season and i cant even log into the launcher.

I did alot of things but nothing is helping. Please someone if you know how to fix this help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,",FortNiteBR

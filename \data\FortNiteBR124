Don't get me wrong, a lot of them are justified, like those who played in winter royale and that. But for me, one of the most distinguishing features of Fortnite as a FPS is that the strategy of the game is always changing. I've barely been playing since Septemberish, and in that time there's already been glider redeploy, a giant tornado Island outside tilted, Shadow stones, zombies, corruptions, planes, ziplines and a fucking sword. This is a big part of what I love about Fortnite, I'm always looking forward to what bullshit they're gonna throw at you next.

Maybe I'm biased because I kinda suck right now so I wouldn't really notice meta changes, but I feel like it keeps the game from stagnating. If they'd just buffed and nerfed season 1 items instead of vaulting them, would you still be playing? I love the constant change in Fortnite, and hope it doesn't get discouraged for future games.",FortNiteBR

2.Make the sword spawn randomly after the first or second circle or make it spawn at a random location after 2 minutes.
3. Add stamina when holding the infinity blade and make it cost stamina when doing a heavy attack and a weak attack. Ex:200 base stamina 25 stamina for heavy attack and 10 stamina for a weak attack.
4. stamina that has high regeneration when out of combat but very low regeneration when in combat.
5.while holding the sword the player only regains health/shield when at full stamina. This is so while the player uses the sword they must make a choice of whether to get kills or heal.
6. In in game modes that have respawn the sword will start to damage the player holding it unless they are in combat but will have reduced stamina cost for all abilities and heal the player holding it for each kill they get.
7.Add a new move to the infinity sword that can only be used when player gets 5 kills with the sword. Ex: dragon slash 100 stamina cost : Blocking/reflecting bullets 50 stamina a sec.
8. Make the infinity blade start of at 50 base damage for weak attacks when hitting a player but increase its attack by 5 for each kill the player gets while holding the sword until a player gets 5 kills making the max damage the damage of the sword at 75 for a weak attack.
9. The first person picking up the sword will get a damage debuff  for 1 minute that reduces their damage in half.
10. After killing someone with the infinity blade the player will get a 30 sec debuff to damage that will lower their attack by half for the first five kills they get with the infinity blade.",FortNiteBR

Whenever I wanted to play the game I would have to update it first. Back then I thought it was annoying, but later I realized that the updates where a good thing. Finally a developer that listens to the community and fixes issues quickly, I thought. 
The community complains about the prices of the cosmetics: Epic introduces the battle pass. The community says that the map is getting boring: Epic adds new poi’s to the map. They also fixed a lot of building issues that the community was complaining about. Finally we could build a ramp in a tree. Every time an item looked shitty, it would usually be a great addition to the game. The campfire for example: I thought it would encourage players to camp, but it turned out to be to 25 seconds. Because you had an healing item that didn’t take up a slot, you could carry an extra gun, which would encourage players to be more aggressive. The chug jug seemed overpowered at first, but turned out to be completely balanced. 
But then, near the end of season 3, meteors started falling from the sky. They destroyed Dusty Depot and the old factories. This seemed like a perfect opportunity to make the middle of the map more interesting. 
During season 4, they kept adding stupid items and would completely ignore community feedback. These were the first signs Epic Games was getting overconfident. They thought they could do whatever they want, because we would all keep playing anyways. 
And we did, just like we kept buying their cosmetics. With the start of season 5 they added nice thing to the map, but they also added a shotgun delay. This divided the community: some people loved it, some people hated it. 
Season 6 was a disaster. I don’t think anyone really liked it. By adding glider redeploy they divided the community once again.
Now we’re in season 7, and they’re still not listening to us. They haven’t done anything with Dusty Divot and they keep adding more and more things that are the exact opposite of what the community wants. I’ve not yet completely lost faith in Epic Games, but I’m getting really sick of this. Epic is too confident that we’ll keep playing their game, despite all the things they do. Fortnite will still be the most popular game for a while, COD and other games have proved that, but soon, people will not take it anymore and leave.

Here are a few of my solutions:
-besides the regular solo, duo’s and squads gamemodes, there should be a gamemode with glider redeploy. On Monday it would be in solo’s, Tuesday in duo’s, Wednesday in squads, and Tuesday in solo’s again. Basically, switch it up everyday. Also switch between the large team ltm’s like soaring 50’s, disco domination and food fight.
-remove shotgun delay 
- fix the building issues. For example: you have to look all the way down to place a stair right in front of you. This seems easy to fix. There’s also a problem with walls placing ‘in the ground’. This can be fixed by simply making it so whenever a player places a wall ‘in the ground’ it automatically builds another wall on top off it.
-add a separate editing sensitivity

I will continue to update this post with new solutions and I would love to hear your ideas as well.",FortNiteBR

Intermediate 3. Pro,"TLDR: 3 modes, material cap would decrease the higher up you go. All mobility items are available in begginer, and as you go up to pro there will only be a few to choose from.


Explanation for each of the modes:


Beginner- This mode would include every mobilty item available. Unvaulting the bouncepad for easier (Quicker) gameplay and also impulse nades too. The goal of this would be so that newer players would have a more forgiving playstyle to it. It would allow people that are newer with the game to take their time a bit more and not have to concidder the zone as much since every mobility item would be available. Material cap would be 999 wood, brick, metal. Killing an opponent would heal for 125 and grant 200 of each material.

Intermediate- Mobility items in this mode would start to decrease, making players have to be more aware of the zone. By doing so this would be a nice change for the people looking to get out of the begginer stages and work towards the pro side of things. The mobility items available in this mode would include grapplers, planes, rift-to-go, atvs, golf carts, impulse nades. Material cap would be 750 wood, brick, and metal. Killing an opponent would heal for 100 and grant 150 of each material.

Pro- Mobility items in this mode are now scarce. Being only left with the grappler, rift-to-go, and atvs only. Players in this mode need to prioritze positioning more so then the rest. Since mobility items are limited you are left with less time being able to farm/loot, if you are at this point you should already know most if not all landing spots and must be a quick at looting and mining. Material cap would be 500 wood, brick, and metal. Killing an opponent would heal for 100 and grant 100 of each material.

Farming rate will not change from mode to mode.

There would also be an elo cap for each mode, once surpassing the level you will not be able to enter that mode again, if your elo drops the lower modes will then open up again for you to play. Winning in a higher mode grants more elo. This would stop people from becoming pub stompers in the lower modes.",FortNiteBR

But it's MY most kills, and my first double digits at that. It started off pretty badly too. TL:DR at bottom.


Me and a buddy go no fill into team rumble but the game throws a 3rd player into the squad for some reason, but me and my buddy are in party chat so it's no biggie. I drop tomato and my buddy drops block, the enemy has tilted side and I figure I'll be good to loot.



Not to be, I drop, manage to grab a single blue burst and BOOM, blue assault to the head and I'm dead. Some guy dropped tomato and wrecked my shit.


Now Im kinda miffed but it's chill because it's only the start, but then I realize where I'm spawning......right above tilted. Now I'm freaking, they have tilted side so literally 0 teammates of mine have dropped there.


I drop trump tower, no one's looted it, guess they thought they had time to root around. I grab a silenced blue pistol and get to work. Now I'm doing business, I have limited ammo, like 56 some odd rounds, not a lot of ammo if you know how accurate silenced weapons are.


I tag one guy at the building under construction up top as he goes for a chest, he freaks but doesn't see me, God knows how. He hides but 12 seconds later he and a buddy run right back in to the open, guy hasn't even healed. I 2 tap him and swap to the blue burst I still have and shred his buddy after I knock his wall.


Now I've got maybe 20 rounds for the pistol and I find the gun to make my game, a green pump and a mother f***ing golden smg. I love this thing, and now I'm super excited. I see building on the opposite side of trump tower, towards the hill, so I swap sides to see 2 guys killing a teammate of mine who ran in on foot.


They aren't on the hill yet and need to build over, and I manage to kill 1 with the silenced pistol, the guys freaking and building walls towards the hill, leaving his back exposed. His buddy doesn't even notice because he's looting the corpse and I run out of ammo before I can kill him. I swap to my smg and land 2 or 3 hits before he dips, but he builds a ramp and pops up again into my bullets and dies anyways. 


That's about all I can recall in detail of the game, and I didn't know that you had to delete recordings to make room for more. So I'm super pissed about that.


 But the TL;DR is this: I started a match with a death at tomato and ended with 10 kills undefeated at tilted, with so much death in my wake they completely stop dropping tilted. 

Yeah, we lost, 65 to 100, doesn't matter, 10 kills in a row. 
Yeah, my buddy accidentally muted his mic and was screaming at me in mock anger to take a med kit for 3 minutes, doesn't matter, 10 kills.
Yeah, that's probably the best my basic ass default skin will ever do, doesn't matter, I literally can not stop smiling. 



Thank you fortnite, for the awesome memories with my friends, the fun games I've played, and the many more to come. Yours truly, a fan. ",FortNiteBR

I have been always against paying real money to buy cosmetics/skins when playing any game. When it comes to Fortnite I see people who spend well over few hundred bucks just on skins and think ""Wow with all that money spent I could have spent it on something else"". 

Now I know these so called micro-transactions help the developers fund their development of the game but is it really that necessary to pay the premium for owning tons of skins then one day when you quit the game you have felt like you wasted money on those skins that you have bought.

I think I can relate this to real life example like buying cheap good quality clothes compared to buying designer clothes which you are pretty much paying the premium for the design/brand.

I have spent $10 on this game for the battle pass and have played it for nearly a year and I’m happy with the $10 spent because I can get more challenges (gameplay enhancement) and hey those battle pass rewards come with it too as an extra! Great! And you even get to renew your battle pass for free as long as you play enough to earn 950 V-Bucks within that season.

Are there people who feel the same way as I do? To me I’d rather spend my money on things that can enhance the gameplay rather than cosmetics which just give you the look. I just don’t see why people are hooked in to buying skins every now and then like they have money spending problem.

Sorry for those of you who disagree with me. I just rather keep my money and spend it on something tangible. If the game developers add something that enhances the gameplay then I am more than happy to spend my money if I feel if it’s worth it.

I’d like your opinion on this.

Thanks

1. When anyone jumps out of a plane, they no longer can sky dive down. They’ll be forced to deploy a parachute (not a glider/umbrella). The parachute will force you to float down semi-slow and will have health sort of how balloons do but more. So if someone shoots your parachute enough, you fall to your death. This will stop people from being able to skydive/third party every fight.    
    
Bonus suggestions:    
    
1. Remove the turret from planes. If you want to shoot, you can still switch positions or your teammates can still shoot from the wings/tail.    
    
2. Reduce planes volume by 75%. This way, you can actually hear something other than planes when you’re in pleasant, sometimes titled, and other poi’s early game.    
    
3. Planes can no longer break through structures.

It usually doesnt place that floor instantly and you can get easily get shot through the floor (actually theres no floor just a blueprint and after few milliseconds it appears). So why does blueprint show instantly and building not? Well when you go into build mode, you have an animation of taking out your pen and paper. As soon as you switch to build mode you will see the blueprint but you are able to place a building at the very end of the pulling pen animation.

(Player Revive Squads/Duos),"How many times have you lost a team mate early in the match? You either kill yourself so you can play together in a new game or they sit and spectate you. The social aspect of Fortnite is huge, and not being able to play with your pals cause some thirsty tryhard eliminated them before you get the revive is a real bummer. 

I propose some type of radio to call back to the Battle Bus so you can pick a team mate to bring back into to the fight. This would create incentive for your friends to stick around with the chance that they may be able to have another shot at Victory Royale. 

Questions to be considered - 

* Spawn rate and from what? (Chest, Supply Drops)
* How long would it take to use?
* Will it create vulnerabilities during use for the activating player?
* How many spawn into a single game?
* Would they need to drop from the bus again, or could they just pop out of the rift?

I thinks it's a plausible idea, maybe even a larger communication device like a mobile antenna to bring back more than one squad member.

The story was actually good compared to the rest of the seasons, the map was updated weekly and it was actually enjoyable.

Double pump was a thing (people think it’s cancerous... it kinda is but it was fun because the kids who didn’t know how to do it struggled to survive).

I also enjoyed the time and dedication that they did to put something into the story that we actually looked into.

Season 4 was by far the best season, hands down in everything. Season 5 was the spray meta, season 6 was just boring, season 7 is kinda fun but really? Airplanes and god damn balloons?

Season 3 was just an OG season... no story really and everything else was the same.

Season 4 had great weapons, they actually had BOUNCERS! They had a wonderful battle pass that you actually had to grind in, and yes it took hard work and dedication....

Just miss the season. Do you guys agree or disagree? If you disagree tell me why you do, and if you agree just tell me something else I forgot about season 4.

Epic wants to make the game appeal to more casual players, but this way they are hurting the more hardcore playerbase, so a competitve mode would certainly statisfy both sides. Yes, it will most likely split the community, but it will be for good.

Make a casual mode the way it is now, with weekly updates and new additions to the game so that the casual players can face angainst eachother and have fun. That would certainly open an opportunity for smurfing, but would it be much different to what we have right now where everyone plays together no matter how good or bad they are. Also a ranking system could easly be implemented to prevent that from happening.

Add a competitve mode where everyone can still play it, but there would be just basic items like riffles, shotguns, snipers and grenades. Transportation would be a lot more limited aswell, no rifts, no planes and ziplines, maybe even just shopping carts and atks. Lower materials cap and faster farming would be a thing.

3. Pop up Cup/Leaderboards
- Leaderboard in Fortnite would be the best addition it would give incentives to grind
- Pop Up Cup settings (50hp per kill and 150 mats) should be added to the game for less stale gameplay 
4. Bouncers

- I would also say make it where you cannot put it on floors so you cannot get insta high ground.
- You can build fight with little worry of dieting to fall damage

Now my question is, when were these rewards given to the players?  
At a certain level or just when you played in season 1?  
I wish i could know to what level I got because if i made it to level 25 I would be bummed that I haven’t bought renegade raider. But i probably didn’t even made it that far I think.  
  
**Special season rewards shop in season 1 explanation for the clueless people**  
  
&gt; Yes, there was a glider skin (The Mako), The Umbrella (i believe you still earn this for your first win) and a profile icon of a singing battle bus you could all earn for free similar to the free battle pass in season  
2. There was also a special season rewards shop (this concept was replaced with the battle pass) that had a few items that you could buy with V-bucks once you reached a certain level with the Aerial Assault glider available for 500 V-bucks at level 5, Aerial Assault Trooper for 1,200 at level 15, Renegade Raider for 1,200 at 25 and the Raiders Revenge Pickaxe at the level 35 for 1,500 V-bucks. As you can see, the battlepass is a much better way to monetize the game and incentivise daily play.  
  
Imagine if epic would make a special event where season 1 players that made it to level 35 but never bought anything from the special season rewards shop could get a second chance to buy them.

Because my solution would be so that the bush either absorbs the first hit, for example say you get hit with a sniper it does no damage instead. This still destroys the bush though.

1. building is what makes this game unique yet they want to phase it out of the game completely by nerfing if

2. if you're a bad player then it's ok, epic has you covered. you can blow someone up with loads of dynamite, go through their builds with a plane, take out a turret and spray them or throw down a boom box, no need to learn how to get better 

3. there's no reward for playing aggressive. in the pop up cups not one person has complained about 50hp per kill yet they refuse to add it, why? 

4. glider redeploy was hugely controversial at the time when they were adding it and it was definitely unexpected because of the pros and cons it brings yet they didn't hesitate at all. they added it and people liked and thought it could use some tweaking. nope. removed and that's it gone.

5. so out of touch with the pros and tournaments which people play in for huge money. eu servers played the winter royale then na did but with a sword that gave you extra health, made you quicker and could go through builds like nothing causing a player  to get 13 kills

6. fortnite is one of the most played games oat by pros yet there's no competitive mode. call of duty, fifa, ow and plenty more all have these modes which help you track your progress as a player by playing players of similar skill.

7. removing things that were balanced and rewarded skilled players such as bouncers. bouncers allowed you to get down from high ground after a fight to avoid fall damage and even made some good plays but nope, too complicated for casuals so let's remove them altogether.

8. the praise epic got for removing the sword was so cringe, so many players and even streamers were like 'omg epic best devs ever they listen to fans!!!' but they don't. who the fuck asked for a sword or more similar items? they just added them and that was that, deal with it.

tl;dr mini rant about how epic has got undeserved praise from the playerbase here because they reply to the odd post here and there while adding things that are ruining the game which nobody asked for or wants. thanks

Shouldn’t it be the opposite? The more I play the better I get? 

It seems to me that if you’re not spending free time studying Fortnite by watching streamers and catching up on new metas, you will be left behind by the better players. And I’m not taking a shot at better players for doing this, I’m just saying it leaves more casual players in the dust.

With the new buffs to shotguns and building strategies and now added mobility, I have found it extremely difficult to win a solo game in season 7 when I used to win around 5% of them back in season 4. It literally feels like I’m becoming a noob again. And I shouldn’t have to put research into a video game in order to enjoy it. 

Is there any agreement with me here? I feel as if Fortnite isn’t fun anymore when it’s just constantly being dominated by Streamer[xxx] every game. I’m not asking to play against noobs but I would like to play against people who are equally skilled as me - those fights I always find to be most intense and exciting.",FortNiteBR

The dynamite and boombox are very difficult to counter since they damage the main core of the game which is building. When the sword was added, the game was in a bad state.

-The turret should receive a huge nerf by lowering the damage to 10-20 and receiving more bloom.
-The pilot should be more exposed when flying.
-Amount of boost should be lowered.
-Every spawn apart from the ones in the snowy area should be removed.
-Upon crashing into builds or natural structures once during a boost (Max speed), the plane should explode or atleast take a few hundred damage.

We ran benchmarking software on the OnePlus 6T and found out that Android Fortnite only uses 2.7GB of RAM max? That's pretty terrible. Why not use at least 4GB? The 6T has 6GB, 8GB, and 10GB models. CPU utilization was also pretty low on the 6T.

Please make it load faster on powerful devices so that I have a reason to get an Android phone.

When I got in to the lobby, I was presented with a ""Hello?"" from a player that couldn't have been any more than 8 years old. I used to be 8 years old myself so that's how I was able to determine that this was a particularly young fellow that I had been paired with.

I said Hi to him, and then we agreed that we would hot drop Retail Row together. 

As the Bus was flying over Retail Row, I was actually browsing Reddit at the time. The only reason I jumped in relatively good time is because the young gentleman had already jumped and he said ""Are you jumping or what?"" to me. 

As a result of jumping a bit late, I landed on the roof of the house next to the Basketball Court with another Duo inside. They had looted the chest in the attic so I had no weapon yet. I jumped off the roof and tried to proceed towards the NOMS building, but I was met by the Duo in the house I landed on top of as they were leaving that house via the front door. One of the players in the Duo, a Red Lynx, one pumped me and downed me. 

Now, I can't remember *exactly* what my young Duo partner who couldn't have been any older than 8 years old said to me word for word after I got downed, but it was something along the lines of ""omg you are so fucking bad at this game you fucking bot"". He then told me that he could ""clap my cheeks"" in a 1v1 in Playground. 

Something that I do remember him saying to me word for word was ""I could fuck your sister better than you play Fortnite"". I don't have a sister, but I feel like he would do it anyway.  

I was eliminated by said Red Lynx, and I decided that it was probably best that I leave the game all together before the young child developed a hemorrhoid as a result of being so angry with me.

*Sweaty Steve*. Steve plays to get hundreds of wins, decimate players that arent as good, plays in tournaments/scrims, and LOVES this game because of building and how it creates a skill gap. Steve hates new items that lower the skill gap and takes away the ability to build or control the outcome of a game. Steve gets pissed when carl kills him with a plane. Less RNG, More skill, happier Sal.

**Type #2**

*Casual carl*. Carl plays this game because its fun and unique, and constantly adds wacky new items that keep the gameplay fresh by offering a wide variety of ways to play. Carl likes to win, sure, but carl likes playing LTMs/goofing around with friends and appreciates the chance to kill Steve on occasion. He hates when every game Steve is building a castle while flying around with a deagle and grappler. More fun, less sweats, happier Carl.


The thing is, there is nothing wrong with either Steve or Carl. Unfortunately, these two types of players are constantly at each other’s throats on this sub and the competitive sub. And in the general community. Both groups seem hell bent on getting the other to think like them. 

Uh.....good luck with that. 

The point of this post is for people to  maybe take a step back and realize both groups are ok and important to this game, and both deserve an environment to thrive. So everyone lower the pitch forks in the comment section, and lets work on pushing creative ways for all the Carls and Steves to have fun with this game at the same time. The idea of a separate ranked mode has been floating around and seems like a great way to solve this. But keep coming up with other solutions that work for everyone, instead of stroking out when you come across those damn sweaty Steves or casual carls on the sub.

EDIT: im aware there are people that fall in the middle. But many people fit into one of these categories, and these are the ones that are the most vocal. If you take the time to post and read about this game on a sub, odds are you are  passionate about it mostly for one of these two reasons.",FortNiteBR

1. Vindertech’s mistake

So, the story of Fortnite begins as such:

In the beginning, there was just the storm...and Vindertech

An odd and mysterious storm of unknown origins has plagued the earth, taking quite a bit of the population with it. (We know this via Save The World mode) 

It has been theorized that the storm was actually a product of a technology company called “Vindertech”. But why would Vindertech, a company that makes technology to fight the storm, create an apocalyptic storm? Simple, make a problem, sell a solution. It’s to be believed that Vindertech created the storm to sell their products. These “Pre-storm products” are unknown and never really talked about.

But what Vindertech hadn’t planned on was the impact of the storm, and what they had just created. This storm would just be a nuisance, it would be catastrophic. It would *almost, end the world.

But once the storms hit, and the damage was done. Vindertech “Disappeared”...or so we thought...

2. The solution

It’s also revealed in STW that Vindertech “Went Dark” after the storms, yet their technology was seen everywhere. Chances are, if it’s tech, it’s Vindertech. So this leads me to believe that Vindertech didn’t actually go away, they just went to change themselves. 

(Stay with me here, The Battle Royale lore is coming!)

Vindertech “retreated” to repurpose their tech to help any survivors fight the storm. The storms main affect on people is it’s essentially Poisonous to humans. As seen in STW, the storm mutates humans into zombie-like creatures known as Husks. People had no way to fight these storms until Vindertech brought their weapons to the public. (This may also explain why the storm got so far out of hand, is because Vindertech had to retreat to make these weapons.) 

So, for those who haven’t played it, STW starts out with a cutscene if a survivor taking shelter in what appears to be an old Vindertech facility. This facility I believe was abandoned once Vindertech went into hiding to make their new tech. Now this facility is home to a robot named “Ray” who wants to, you guessed it, save the world. But she’s just a tiny robot so she enlists the help of people known as “Heroes” (the people you play as) to help her with the dirty work. There was a limited time mission where you had to find a survivor out in a mission, and after you rescue her, states she wants to join you. Ray however then goes on to say that these “Heroes” are trained at what they do. So here is where I believe Battle Royale comes in. Battle Royale is a distant island somewhere on the planet that these heroes are sent to so they can find the best of the best. But how what one find the best out of, say, 100 people? Simple, have them to fight to the (near) death! 

3. Battle Royale!

So these heroes are chosen to fight the storm and go out into the world by having them train in battle Royale. This is alluded to when your character gets “eliminated” (or deemed “unfit”) while fighting. Notice that your character never just lays there and dies, they always get teleported away. This also proves why the word “kill” is never in the game. Because you never actually die, just injured and returned to home base (The lobby screen) to ready up and prove your worth over and over again until you indeed are “The best out of 100”

You might be thinking “Cool, you’ve wasted hours researching and typing to tell us that a company made a storm, then trains people to fight it...Bravo...”

But now here’s the interesting bit. Why in a matter of a year and half has this island been but through dimensions, practically turned into a climate change specialists nightmare, been visited by a giant dimensional Rubix cube, and and now been smashed into by another island on an iceberg? Well, that’s where we talk about our old pal, the storm again.

4. The storms power

I’ve already stated that Vindertech was in WAY over their head while trying to create to storm. They had no idea what they were creating, they just thought whatever it was, they could make a solution to fight it and they’d be rich and it would go away. Well whatever they put in this storm literally has the power to create Monsters that nobody can even imagine. For example, Crackshot? It’s recently been revealed that he is not a man in a costume. He is an actual product of the storm. An actual monster that is hellbent on making sure everybody has Christmas cheer...or else. So as you can see, this storm can create unthinkable things and because of that, can make unthinkable things happen.

5. First Contact

Our first “phenomenon” however wasn’t actually caused by the storm. It was just your average everyday alien just coming to give us a friendly visit. His intentions are unknown, but “The Visitor” came from space in case you didn’t pick that up. While he crash landed, people were starting to get ahold of themselves after the events of the storms, and apparently even started making movies! (This is seen as the Carbide and Omega movie being produced all through season 4). As the government was trying to contain The Visitor, players could see something out of the natural for the first time...Hop Rocks.

It’s possible that The Visitir was actually running from something. (Quite possibly some kind of space police, is my guess) He most likely stole or brought whatever Hop Rocks were, and that’s why they appeared when he did. (This is also hinted as to why they were only in meteor crash sites). But once the visitor broke free from his pod, he was faced with a problem...how does he get home?

6. The Rift

Picture it, your sitting with your film crew after a hard days work, when all of the sudden that FAKE rocket you built decides to take itself on a joy ride. This is obviously the visitors doing as seen in a certain loading screen. The visitor used the “hop rock tech” to fuel and turn this fake rocket into a fully functional rocket. But unfortunately for the inhabitants of earth, gasoline pollution ain’t got nothing on hop rock pollution (especially when mixed with the effects of the storm). Once the rocket blasted off it was using so much energy that it couldn’t be contained but instead of exploding, it rather...imploded. 

Apparently the hop rocks have some kind of inter dimensional ties (this may also be why the visitor was perhaps trying to steal them) because once the ship imploded it caused a huge tear in the sky that we would soon find out to hit a lot closer to home than anybody could have thought...literally.

7. Our World

This tear wasn’t just your average sky crack. It would be the start of 2 seasons worth of lore and story that would quite possibly change the course of Fortnite as we know it. 
This “Rift” was proven to be a link between our world, and Fortnite world. Right around the turn of season 4 going into 5, something showed up in OUR desert. Something very juicey and cheesy. That’s right, The durr burger statue from grease grove showed up in our world. There were many clues left at the durr burger site that unfortunately weren’t decided in time before it was revealed to us via the game, but there was secret codes hidden around that showed us exact locations of where a certain cube would appear within the coming days. (For a more in depth look at this, I 100% recommend MatPat’s video talking about this https://youtu.be/T8JwxWL5aZU ). 

8. His name is Kevin

Once our little cube friend (Obviously charged with some kind of energy) decided to make landfall (which by the way, took the rift in the sky with him) it began to roll around the map, making “runes” he then decided to melt into loot lake and start us of on season 6 with a high note! (Again...Literally)

So as seen in the season 6 trailer, the cube (known as Kevin by most) started to pick up the house in loot lake and lift it about 300 ft in the air and also felt the need to make a tornado in the process. (Oh Kevin, you little scamp!) this cube then goes to each “rune” and “activates” them, causing each rune to start to hover and glow.

It’s thought that these runes were put there to make a sort of track for Kevin follow while making his second joyride around the map. Once Kevin had achieved his goal and sucked the energy back from the runes that all met just southwest of dusty divot, he moved back to Leaky lake for his grand finale. He went out with a boom (you already know the drill........Literally)

9. The butterfly effect

If players saw this happen, they would have been transported into an unknown dimension that was all white and surrounded by all 99 other players floating around them. But out of nowhere, a rift appears and then slowly forms into a butterfly. The butterfly would land on the player and then send them back to earth and welcome them to a beautiful new island now what a new improved loot lake. 

10. The Reasons

So now pops the question, who the heck is Kevin, and what the heck was seasons 5-6 all about? So here’s the low down. Season 5 is about the chaos created in season 4 by the visitor’s rift rocket implosion. Two worlds colliding, players literally having the ability to use dimensional gate ways for their own leisure, and apparently judging by the Viking ship, time was also involved in this catastrophe. But the silver lining was the “road trip” skin found in week 7 of season 5. It was called the “The Enforcer” with the tag line “Balance and order must be restored”. The enforcers jobs were to bring the cube to earth to rebalance or “cleanse” the earth of its unstable state. However it’s obvious that these enforcers weren’t from Fortnite s dimension OR our dimension, so this proves there was a 3rd party dimension the whole time (I believe players physical state was in this dimension while using the shadow stones). So they were sent to clean up the visitors disaster during seasons 4-6. And once Kevin restored balance to earth (the butterfly is meant to be a physical embodiment of balance during the explosion event). Players could rest at ease knowing everything was restored...

11. A cold Awakening

But then they started to feel a bit chilly all of the sudden... thins were pretty calm the last few weeks of season 6 with the only thing happening being a dinky little snow cloud on the horizon and the appearance of every bodies special little robot friend A.I.M. Who’s origins were unknown, but his hands and feet were frozen solid. He came from the south, almost the exact direction of the cloud, but surely it was a coincidence right...right?

12. Power hungry

So once season 7 started we are greeted with a giant iceberg smashing into the islands southwest shores and once again, giving us a massive terrain change from tilted to what WAS flush factory. The most noticeable thing about our new frozen neighbors is that right off the bat we notice a research group has put up equipment and vehicles ALL over the island. This is also the same group that sent AIM to warn us about the oncoming storm (or spy on us, I’m not sure yet). However the biggest change of all the iceberg itself, polar peak. It houses a castle with a mysterious and possibly threatening king known as the ice king. At first we could only visit the top part of the castle since it hadn’t melted yet, but we soon notice that the ice is melting, revealing more castle each day. However, this wasn’t something necessarily good, as things got stranger the more it melted. Our first red flag was that the ice king has a chunk of the the meteorite. Our second red flag was just your average dragon egg chilling in the castles dungeons. Now it was proposed by a redditor (I can’t say who because it’s been passed along so many times, I just know it’s not me) that it wasn’t a coincidence that the iceberg crashed on OUR island. They said that the ice king was coming for something, something he needed, that we had.

...Kevin...

It was theorized that the ice king needs A LOT of energy to hatch those dragon eggs and we think that’s why he has a piece of the meteor, is because it’s still flowing with energy from the hop rocks. But it wasn’t enough, so now he needs more energy, and what has a crap ton of energy on our island? You guessed it! Pieces of Kevin.

But unfortunately this is where our story must come to an end, because we’ve reached the present day. So until more happens, this is it!",FortNiteBR

I have had this idea for a while but just thought i should post it here:

Create a legitimate classic gamemode.  
1. No Turbo Build,

2. Double pump after nerf. (Not OG Double Pump that is way to OP, having end of season 3 Double Pump leaves other setups viable (Shotgun+SMG, Pump+Tac shotgun))

3. Old weapons (Tactical SMG, or even OG SMG, Gold bolt action, Semiauto sniper, etc.)

4. No vehicles 

5. I want to say the old map, but that ain't happening but I still want to mention it.

With that in mind people should learn the threat these changes hold and adapt their playstyles accordingly.

For example, if you know boomboxes, dynamite, and planes threaten your build fight. Maybe try engaging in less build fights? The longer you draw out a fight for high ground, the more likely you are to fall victim to one of these items.Maybe try carrying more items that allow you to safely engage in fights like balloons and grapplers, and if you don't have these weigh the risks. 

Building makes Fortnite unique but it's not, and shouldn't be the only way to enjoy the game. That's why these changes exist, to expand the variety of playstyles the game offers. There's other ways to improve your game. Aim, positioning, game sense, ect. building will always be a strong skill despite these changes, but being a good builder alone just doesn't guarantee you (AS MANY) wins anymore. That's just how it is.

They keep constantly giving us items to counter building, i mean, look at some of the most recent items added that counter building:

•Boombox (Needs Vaulted)
•Infinity Blade (Vaulted)
•X-4 Storming (Needs Vaulted!)
•Dynamite (Big Nerf)

all of these are HUGE counters to building, and if you go through all the items in the game, there must be over 20-30 items that counter building, this includes:

•Quadcrasher
•Port-A-Fortress (Needs Vaulted)
•Grenades
•Minigun (Needs Vaulted)
•Heavy Sniper
•Handcannon (Needs slight nerfs)
•RPG
•Grenade Launcher
•Quad-Launcher (Needs Vaulted)
•Grappler
•Mounted Turret (Needs Vaulted)
•Balloons

And there’s probably more!

The main counter to building in fortnite, in my opinion, should be BUILDING! I feel like each week building to building becomes weaker and weaker with the amount of pointless items being added. And i know if you go on twitter you see people saying “LiKe FoR dOuBLe PuMp” but like honestly I WANT IT, i’m sick to god of spraying with SMG’s, missed going to daequans stream and see him tear apart with the OG double pump, it’s what i was good at. Epic need to put their old shoes on and get back into making fortnite feel good again, i wouldn’t even mind a double pump ltm tbh

rant over, leave your opinion please

(Yes I understand how a battlepass works I’m an og) This allows players to unlock tiers from previous seasons that only the PLAYER bought the battlepass in, and reached a certain tier like 25 or something. 

The tiers are earned a little harder than normal. For example, when you earn 20 battlepass stars, you unlock a tier. Both battlepasses will receive the credit, and the “second chance battlepass” will not have purchasing battle stars option available to them. Meaning everything is 100 earned. Any items like xp bonuses will be earned, however they will not count towards the current season. Once you have used a second chance ticket on a season, you will lose the ticket and that seasons battlepass can never be used with a ticket again. 

How do you earn a “second chance ticket”? In the future battlepass, at tier 75, you will earn the ticket. Once you have earned the ticket, you will have an option under the current battlepass that will allow you to pick a season that you’ve played in, each having a banner-like picture of all the main skins in that battlepass with the season number on it. On the top right where your v-buck currency is, will be your “second chance ticket” currency. There is no limit on how many you can own

Why do I want this? Well this allows players that played during a season but didn’t earn all of what they wanted to have the ability to EARN these items. Since none of the tiers can be purchased and are double what a normal battle star is, this means that the player had to grind if they want something like the reaper skin, omega, or black knight. Since most weekly changes only give you 5 tiers per week, with 10 weeks, alone they would only earn 50 tiers of the battlepass, every 4 daily challenges would unlock them a tier, and every 10 levels (about) would earn them a tier as well. Also, this allows new players to not own an “og” skin since the o lot people that can earn these skins are still technically “og”

I understand that once the season is over none of the items can be earned again, but I feel like this will be well received by the community. And just so no one jumps to any conclusions, I’ve been playing since season 2, and have always maxed my battlepasses, so in no way to I think this will benefit me, but rather a large amount of the community that has had the issue of not being able to do the same during a certain time. Plus no one has to do this. It’s 100% optional to try and earn old cosmetic items again.

For a few months now, I have been heavily addicted to Fortnite, I have spent about 970 US dollars on in-game cosmetics, which is almost 49 times more than my monthly limit. And yes I have stolen my older brother’s credit card in the past, about 4 times. My parents have confiscated my Xbox and my Nintendo switch, but I still manage to play on mobile with 2 fingers. I usually stay up until 5-6 am playing fortnite, which sometimes causes me to pretend to be sick to convince my parents to put me off school for the day, I then spend the rest of that day playing more Fortnite in bed. I’m not the best in the game, I have about 18 solo wins since I started playing in late season 3, but I have quiet a lot of squad wins with my friends. I have recently started having epileptic and spastic seizures in the morning or late afternoon. Last night I found myself licking the bottom of my bathtub and gently spreading the saliva to cover the whole bathtub, I then lowered myself into it and started sliding about, pretending I was on one of those icy areas near greasy grove. I have also generally been running around my house screeching and trying to bite my family members &amp; my dog.

We all thought that it could be a progression quest, just like the ‘Complete _ Daily Rewards’.  We thought that if they gave us 100 V-Bucks per 2 wins it could be balanced. That way it would motivate people to play more, maybe even spend some money on v-bucks if they are close to getting a good skin, and also draw in a larger crowd.

I just wish epic didnt pander as much.
(Also remove boom boxes they're unbalanced and the fact that you can stack 6 of them is ridiculous you could have the high ground of a hill and throw it down on someone and that's game over for them).

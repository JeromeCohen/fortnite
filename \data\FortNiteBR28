Honestly the most annoying and op gun in the game currently. It's very OP. 110 damage is too much. 
Just play Team Rumble and literally half the lobby is camping out with bows and getting 15-20 kills with no skill required. 

It's a cheap and OP gun and deserves a big nerf imo. 
Thank God that stupid Bow-Balloon combo is gone, that shit was annoying af. It was a cheap way to get a bunch of kills without even engaging in close combat and putting any effort on it. 

Ever since it came out it was already a very annoying gun and it still is. The Drum Gun ain't the gun we have to nerf here, it's without a doubt the bow.",FortNiteBR

As a sweaty casual playing this game I can say that it has been the best game I've ever played. 5 months ago I couldnt tell you what season it was but I would log onto xbox everyday and have atleast 10 people online ready to play. We would have to fight for who would be in a squad together and we would all have so much fun pub stomping.

Fast forward around 2 months, I've lost half of my friends to other games or just no game at all
apex comes out and we all go play that game for 2 weeks or so. Epic gets scared and releases shield and mats to every kill. Instantly my friends start playing again.

This change allowed people to practice more towards competitive play. Because the the rules were the same as the competitive playlist. Then this started to promote fun aggression. I would watch controller streamers like innocents drop 30s all day and I started practicing... alot. 

Fast forward to two days before they take siphon out and I got my first two 20 bombs. I never had so much fun playing a game. They take siphon out and the amount of people I play with has dwindled to 3 maybe 4.

The pump gets taken out yesterday and now I have 1 friend who still plays.

Why is epic catering to kids who have to beg there parents for skins when they could aim at 16-21 year olds by making the competitive scene better and promoting aggression. Kids with jobs are more likely to spend money in your game. 

The floor is lava is the only mode I have had fun in this season. And I put in 1500 hours into this game this past year.
 

Please epic give us a separate game almost for competitive and a regular casual game. I'm addicted to your game but I'm not enjoying myself.",FortNiteBR

They vault the PUMP a completely balanced weapon and keep the tac in and also add a new shotgun that‚Äôs not good in box fights and CQC. It mainly seems that when the competitive players ask for something they get the complete opposite of what they were asking.

Post will be long.

I remeber the day I started playing fortnite. The only game I was playing at the time was Destiny 2, and man oh man was that game trash. I was walking back to my apartment from classes when my cousin called me and told me to download fortnite. I had no idea what this game was but he said it was a free battle royale and that it looked pretty fun. I was like okay cool Ill download it when I get home and while walking home.I called my younger brother to download it too. Couple hours later the three of us hop on. This was the third day since the battle royale portion of the game came out. We go into the lobby and join up on each other and we were laughing looking at the default skins. After finally figuring out how to load up a game we end up in the battle bus and have no clue what we are doing and where to go. I forgot where we landed, but about 5 minutes in to the game, we end up in Tomato Town and somehow my brother figured out how to build and we got on top of the main building. We managed to build a base and soon after that the storm pulls us towards the east side of loot lake. After a chaotic game of walking around having no idea what to do and pickaxing enemies its us against the last team. We get into a fight and then the last guy on the enemy team blows himself up with a rpg. Our very first game on and we won. Oh wow were we ever excited. Lots of yelling and lets go in the party chat.  One of my favorite video game moments ever. And thus began my journy into fortnite. 

What made the game so fun back in the day was how different this game was from everything else. The building, cartoon graphics, the playstyle, the weapons and traps set this game apart from everything I have ever played. When I first started playing this game, it was almost like I have never played a pvp game in my life. But, despite how bad I was and everyone elss too, I wanted to get better. We kept playing, kept experimenting new strats, new weapon loadouts, trying to improve and after a while we were pretty good at the game. The game was so fun it was so fresh compared to other games out there. 

My brother, cousin, and I have had some pretty insane and fun moments on fortnite. From all of our first 20 kill games, to coming up with challenges to win games, and buying our first skins, the game was a blast. Unfortuntaly, around season 5 the game started to go downhill and my cousin quit. He hated seeing the game he loved change to something it wasnt supposed to be and he dipped. My brother and I kept playing but the quality and gameplay experience declined. Here our some of my complaints about why I believe fortnite went downhill. 

Fortnite catering to noobs. 
Why remove double pump, weaken pumps, and then eventaully vault them?  Why do they make rift to gos, geysers and ballers? Why do they constantly nerf the meta? To protect their new players from getting stomped on. The problem with this is, everyone started as a new player in this game. It took myself from playing since week 1 of the games launch to get where I am skill wise. I get it, its frustrating to die to good players, but it takes time to get better, something epic games wants to remove. People arent gunna hop in season 8 or 9 and be able to hang with people who have been playing since the beginning or earlier season. However epic games wants to make them try tk be able to and in doing so hurts the gameplay mechanics of what made this game so fun. They will improve in time, but by catering to new players it ruins it for older players. 

Updates way to fast. 
Every other week it seems like we get something new in the game. While this waa fun at first, they quickly ran out of ideas and new items were stupid or just plain lazy and not tested at all. We kept getting items that no one asked for and in return for this we loose items we liked to play with. We get changes to the map that no one asked for. It seems like epic games thinks that new content will keep more people playing when instead it pushes then away. It hurts new players beacuase they constantly have to keep relearning and get no time to improve. If epic games would slow down on map changes and new items we would see way better items being added that are balnced and tested along with good map changes. 

Not listening to fans
No one asked for pumps to be removed, but they are gone. No one asked for bouncers or grapplers to be gone, but they are gone. No one asked for tac smgs gone, but they are gone. No one asked for this new combat shotgun, but we got it anyway. No one asked for ballers, but we got it anyway. No one asked for a strip stream railway, but we got one that basically negates the purpose of the storm. No one asked for retail row or tilted to go, but gone they are. No one asked for bolt snipers to be gone, but gone they are. No one asked for bullet velocity on snipers to be changed to the same as heavy, but they did it anyway. As you can see, epic really doesnt care about your opinions. They add stuff and remove items without any warning and any opinions from their players

Ruining competive 
Epic games is all like look here, we got 100 million dollars on the line for competive fortnite! All the sweats are like okay cool, ima practice for this! And then epic games hurts competive gameplay constantly. Removing tilted and retail and then replacing them with a cluster f of buildings during the tournament does not help people who landed there.  Completely changing the gameplay by removing pump during the tournament and adding the drum gun back. Drum gun was good addition though when pump was in game because if I am low hp getting spammed by drum guns I can hop for a 200 hit pump to get them, but now with this new shotgun ill get a 24 hit or something lol. I just cant understand why they want to be so in to competive and esports but then constantly change core mechanics mid tournments or seasons.

No one asked for siphon to be added to the game, but we got it and people liked it. But then as soon as we got it, it vanished. Epic stated it was an aggression problem of people pushing to hard, but the only thing this helped with was balance everyones health to 200hp. It was the one good thing to help all players of all skill levels and balance out the gameplay. They also mentioned it was because people elimanted their knocked oppenents to fast. Okay easy fix. For every 2 health the person bleeds out the person who knocked them gets one health back. But if they finish of their knocked they dont get their health. 

My least favorite thing so far
Season 9 pump vault. They most iconic gun gone from the game. Building and this pump where why the game got where it is. Okay this made me mad, whatever I can adapt to these changes, but what makes me even more mad is the fact they are flexing the heavy pump in season 9 photo but didnt add it right away. The reason why they did this, is so once everyone complains about the pump being gone they will add the heavy shotgun and make it appear they listen to the community and playerbase. 

Epic games is slowly taking what made fortnite FORTITE and throwing all that away. They have the worst solotions to their problems and they are making people quit becausd of this. 

Some of my best video game moments have been on fortnite, but for now Im going to have to quit. The game is not the same great game it was. Maybe Ill be back when they actually care about their community, but for now I am done. Before anyone calls me trash or I get downvoted, this is my opinion. Thank you epic games for the original fortnite you made a great game. It is a shame it was ruined. 

Summary: I quit Fortnite cause they dont care about their playerbase.",FortNiteBR

Vaulting the pumps was smart as it allows them to isolate the use of both the tac and combat shotgun to give players an opportunity to form an opinion on them, then after some number of weeks, they should vault every shotgun, throw us all in the vault and let us decide which shotgun fits the game best for our return.",FortNiteBR

This season 9 in my opinion is a fresh of air and I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. The removing of a pump is honestly a good decision in my opinion because it opens a door to whole mother meta. It is not fun to get one-pumped by the players who are vastly better than you in all aspects of the gameplay.

The removal of pump helps to create a balance between the players who are a lot better than casual players. It gives the players who doesn‚Äôt play a lot a fighting chance to fight against the pro and that is a case for me. Last season before that, I would always get outbuilt by better players and get one pumped on my face all the way back to the lobby. This made me wanted to stop playing this game and I could see other casual players feeling the same way again.

The return of the drum gun in my opinion is a good decision because it SHOWS the majority of players playing the vote who voted for this unvaulted gun. This vote is fair and it should remain that way. Maybe lower the ammo capacity and making the drum gun epic or legendary while vaulting P90 could help to balance this gun. This reddit is in the minority and the vote of drum gun shows the majority of players playing this game.

This season gave me a reason to play again. With the combat shotgun and drum gun, I can now stand my foot against the players who are better than me and I am enjoying it. The ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt change your opinions AT ALL. It makes you a zombie enslaved to their opinions and it blinds you from what you are seeing what is enjoyable for you. If any changes occur, you ADAPT to it and get victory battle royale. Ninja is right about the ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù and I‚Äôm glad he is standing up for us casuals.

The pump was ALWAYS the staple in someone‚Äôs loadout so why was it only vaulted now? 

In regards to pump shotguns, they were just as op in s8 as they were when double pumped got nerfed in s4 so why vault now

Why would they introduce a purple and gold pump in s6 or s7 when pumps were OP in s4 ? Why would they add gold and purp variants just to vault now?

When the 3rd Circle of an Arena match closes, Loot Lake‚Äôs Alien power that‚Äôs powering Neo Tilted has a power outage due to the pressure from the Storm. A warning will pop up next to the minimap, similar to Storm Surge with a 30 second countdown. Neo Tilted and Mega Mall, in addition to the Blimps in the sky, will get progressively darker over this 30 seconds as an in-world indicator (not so dark that you can‚Äôt see. Think old Tilted with streetlights and lights inside buildings, no blaring flashing signs or holograms.)

**When the 30 seconds is up...**

* Neo Tilted and Mega Mall‚Äôs blaring lights will be shut off. Emergency street slights and indoor lights are powered by emergency power sources, so they will not go out, but the signs and holograms will disappear for help of visibility.

* Slipstreams are disabled. All players currently riding a Slipstream will be placed into Skydiving mode where they are.

* Ballers begin losing their natural electromagnetism. To power themselves, they feed off their HP. This causes them to take 2 damage/second. The reasoning for DOT instead of instant destruction is that you don‚Äôt just get booted out in the middle of nowhere, you can rotate before getting out.

* Sky Platforms will slowly lose their power due to the shutoff of the Slipstreams. They will remain in the sky, but an electricity field will expand from the center like a dome, ending when the whole platform is covered. This electricity field, when touched, will act like a lava pool - dealing 1 damage, knocking you back, and preventing fall damage until you land. This stops players from camping on these platforms with no way of getting up, but allows them to get down safely without needing materials or a launch pad.

These changes are to allow healthy mobility around the map, but not interfere with endgame.

If you affected to the point of constant complaints, you aren‚Äôt as good as you think you are.","Although this may be removed or downvoted deeper than the vault itself, the pump vault was the best decision epic has made in a long time. 

All things considered, the pump being out of the game has been a positive for me for these reasons: 

1. Landing off the bus has become more fair. We all know it, land on a pump, you win the drop. Now, if someone picks up a tac, I can get ‚Äúone pumped‚Äù, but it is less likely. I have a chance to fight back. I have a chance to defend myself. An AR, sub, or even a mini gun can provide solid defense against a tac. To me, this is a positive. 

2. It makes for more fair fights end game. There is nothing more infuriating than being 200hp, getting landed on, (not hearing players because of the audio, but that‚Äôs a different story) and getting gold pickled in the back of the skull. No chance to fight back. I much prefer having to hit multiple shots on the opponent than a one pump. If anything, outplaying with builds,l and multiple hits in more impressive than a one pump headshot. 

3. Contrary to what this sub has been saying, this feature makes it *MORE* competitive, not less. Giving more players a chance to fight back lessens the skill gap, making the game more competitive. I‚Äôm sorry you mastered your wall replace, edits, and one pumps. Who said that‚Äôs what makes a great player? Streamers? Reddit? Now, I can get wall replaced, edited and blue tac for 134, but I‚Äôve got some health to respond. I can try to outlast and outsmart. If you‚Äôre truly the greatest sweat to ever grace the battle bus, you‚Äôll kill me off. But please, stop crying about the pump and adapt to the meta. Everyone seems to be so sad when it doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda, and fails to realize there are other opinions. But welcome to the internet, I guess.",FortNiteBR

When you earn vbucks, the game automatically decides to spend those first. When this happens, it can affect your own spending capabilities.

I was in luck. I had the vbucks on my PS4 to get the battlepass and then enough on my PC to get the skin. When I went to make the purchase though, the earned vbucks in my account were depleted first. I was lucky because I had an opportunity to earn some vbucks through STW to make up for this issue, however I know not everyone is that lucky.

Straight to the point. What makes Fortnite special? I've played just a bit, and it is honestly the most boring game in the world. This is coming from a guy who plays racing games for hours straight. I don't get bored easily, needless to say. People act like Fortnite is innovative for adding the whole building thing to a third person shooter. It's just unnecessary in my opinion. On top of that, it isn't the best shooter game out right now, or even third-person shooter. I would say that Gears of War is much better. (I know they are both from Epic Games) 

Understand that I'm not hating on Fortnite, I just don't understand why it is as big as it is. Maybe from hearing you guys, I may be able to try and figure out how this game made it to the top.

There are lots of players who want more than Team Rumble, but just don't have the skills to compete in solos and NEED people of a similar level to enjoy the game more.

**SURPRISE, Look who it could be. It's Season 9 and this is still there:**

[The visitor is here.](https://i.redd.it/1jcu707qdbx21.png)

# My Theory:

**THE VISITOR BROUGHT THE CUBE  WITHIN FORTNITE'S INTER-DIMENSIONAL SPACE VIA DISCOVERING HOW TO RIFT: by the end of season 5, 'worlds have collided'. He found out how to control the cube to control the universe, to bend time, physics, and play god. At the cost of total destruction, so will his future. He brought the Ice and Fire king as prisoners while trying to find a way back to our universe. Destroying anything in his path. He's going to destroy our world without us noticing, while we're enjoying Neo-Towers and the Mega-Mall distractions. The 'future' is and will be too good to be true.**

# But how is this relevant to Season 9 and its Utopian Future?

**The power of the cube and the storm, allows the corruption of people, land, and things. He's basically playing god, and is using the power to mind control and create a facade. The new 'skins' introduced might be real people from a different universe** (*they look nothing like we do, and all of our skins prior to the beginning of Season 9 look IDENTICAL*)**, but they're being mind controlled into influencing our world by faking an apocalypse, pretending to ""save"" us, and ""helping"" us rise from the ashes.**

[Literally a world being consumed by the storm, which according to Dr. Vinderman from Save the World, is also in space and is capable of inter-dimensional travel via rifts.](https://i.redd.it/jvyl3nlibbx21.png)

[Corruption.](https://i.redd.it/6dbgc714cbx21.png)

# But why would the future people and the visitor bring fancy new ways of transportation, new points of interests, and the democracy to choose weapons to un-vault?

**Because what better distraction than pretending that everything is new and amazing. He built the vault to protect and guard the cube. Over time of preparation, he's almost ready to unleash total destruction onto the Fortnite Universe with the cubes storm power by total corruption. He destroyed tilted, saved everyone, and re-built a utopia to emotionally control us into believing it. All behind the curtains, like puppets. Notice the random spring of events happening? The sudden changes? The Fire King, Ice King, Pirates, Vikings, Tomato heads, Durrburger heads, and every single player, has been too busy fighting each other, thinking they're each others true enemies?**  


[Reference for those that know. Credit: Unknown.](https://i.redd.it/w9nqheowgbx21.png)

# But then why do the 'future people' have better technology than us? They must know what they're doing! Have you been on the slipstreams?!?!

**Because WE have the better technology. In-fact, Dr. Vinderman created all the technology, weapons, vehicles, and rifts himself** *(probably no vehicles found in expedition posts, it's trademarked by the visitor)***. It's just a matter of time before the VinderTech comes. In fact, the rocket the visitor found was Dr. Vindermans, it has the ability to rift ANYWHERE. He didn't know it had that ability, and when he found out, he harnessed and mastered that ability. He learned how to create rifts with bluglo, learned about the cube on the way, and started plotting and forming an alliance with the storm creatures.**

**Don't believe me about the VinderTech? See for yourself, it's all VinderTech. You also know what vBucks stands for right?** ***VinderBucks*****:**

[Classic Ray. Basically the 'Alexa' of Fortnite.](https://i.redd.it/936e06paqbx21.png)

# But how do we know how powerful the cube is? All it did was spawn a few creatures!

**Have you played Save the World?**

[This thing is HUGE. like, THE SIZE OF HIS FINGER IS ME.](https://i.redd.it/4lpr6i20jbx21.png)

**Do you know where that thing came from?**

[The cube which spawned and contains the power of the storm. Difficult to defeat, as-long as nothing is feeding it.](https://i.redd.it/v39ykmp4jbx21.png)

# OK. But then how do you factor in the Fortnite World Cup? It's technically part of the story!

**You're right, it is part of the story. The visitor managed to get everyone into a Battle Royale, last person standing ""wins"" riches and a chance to live in 'Neo-Towers' rather than in the out-dated slums like Salty and Pleasant. We literally did him a favor and eliminated most of each other. We even ate each other during the volcano event too** *(rip Peely the Banana)***. The Fire King and Ice King are destroying the world trying to destroy each other. Everyone is in Battle Royal, casted under a spell of deceit and malice. He's succeeding tremendously, and we're too late. The primitive factions are preparing for another apocalypse. They're from the past, so they think we're demons. They can't handle out technology, and they know the end is near. They have Mythic heroes with possess special powers. They're not here yet, the only Mythic thing so far in the Battle Royale is the Infinity Blade, WHICH WAS VAULTED UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE VISITOR.**

# OK. So we're doomed, whats next?

**WE'RE NOT DOOMED, yet. Our heroes are on their way from 'Save the World'. The World Cup will show the beginning. Watch the storm unravel its destruction while you're doing 90's, trying to score a point bonus. You and the 'Future people"" aren't powerful enough to defend anyone, but the heroes are: they have every single invention Dr. Vinderman has made. They can craft and defeat the laws of physics. And the War-Game will begin, what will be known as the Mythic War. We will find a way to contain the storm for a limited amount of time inside this world, as the island starts to tear itself apart while the storm creatures emerge, and we will venture into space, running to the farthest corner of the universe away from the storms destruction. Living in our own creative worlds over centuries, developing new technologies and increasing our war-stock of Mythic abilities. We are the last alive in the whole existence of possibility with endless possibilities: the Fortnite Universe will begin, all in one, and we will become immortal as Mythic's to those that knew us.**

And you'd think for this puny nerf gun that they would at least make it readily available. Nope to that either because it only comes in rare and up. Is Epic Games trying to piss off as many players as possible? They're just gonna make the only reliable and fun gun to battle with and turn it into a junior Nerf gun. This shit can't even one-tap a player.

OR YOU CAN JUST CHOOSE THE SHOTGUN AND INSTANTLY LOSE. Why even call it a combat shotgun? It might as well be called the instant suicide since having this garbage in your inventory is going to make you lose. AND HOW ON EARTH DOES A COOL LOOKING SPAS-12 MILITARY GRADE SHOTGUN GET THE SAME IN GAME NAME AS A GOD DAMN BABY LITTLE HUNTING SHOTGUN.

Alright, so for starters: I have this friend on PC who I play with regularly, and when we got into pump shotgun battles with him in creative we‚Äôd always have a close amount of kills on each other (I play on console btw). However, ever since we started to use the new ‚ÄúCombat Shotgun‚Äù, I noticed our battles would always end up with him killing me every. single. time. I feel like it‚Äôs a bit unbalanced, and doesn‚Äôt really consider console players that much since it‚Äôs hard to get peek-shots on a controller. The weapon lends itself better to longer-range peek-shots, and only rewards distance and gives you 0 advantage at close range- especially when trying to track someone on M&amp;KB.

I feel like this weapon is once again making the bridge between console players and pc players even longer, and is in some aspects unfair to other platforms than pc (and quite possibly mobile). So here‚Äôs my solution: they should‚Äôve just vaulted the **Epic** and **Legendary** pump shotguns, and kept the **Uncommon** and *Rare** ones, not add the **Rare** combat shotgun, and keep the current buff of the tactical shotguns. This is because the pumps were made for headshots and quick body shots when in a build fight, and are heavy hitters in close range- while tactical shotguns shill out more damage at a distance than a pump, and can get more damage off quicker as well. Where would the combat shotgun play a role in this you say? Because of the middle-ground between the two. It deals more damage than a pump would at far range, and has an insane fire rate like the tactical shotgun as well- while still being a weapon that rewards players for being accurate and going for headshots. 

This would also make it so it could appeal to more play styles than one, and keep the tactical shotgun relevant and the pump a solid option as well. I feel like their decision making with this was a bit drastic and non-realistic, and makes it so that the only close range combat is done with spamming automatic weapons. The pump was made into a fair weapon that anyone could use, and all that hard work to get it that balanced just went down the tubes shortly after. I don‚Äôt complain much, but I don‚Äôt think this was the right approach at all. Having every fight at a distance isn‚Äôt fun, and having spam weapon as the only viable option is boring and tiresome. 

Anyhow, this is just my opinion, so I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and act like I know everything. I‚Äôd love to hear you guys‚Äô thoughts on this, though! This is definitely a topic worthy of discussion imo.",FortNiteBR
436,TheNoahFactor64,1557453717,bmsiol,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bmsiol/with_the_release_of_season_9_fortnite_has_been_at/,0,"With the release of season 9, Fortnite has been at an all time low IMO","To start things off, note the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Don't get me wrong, I love this game, I just thought that this needed to be addressed

2.) This is my opinion and I don't expect all of the people reading this to have the same one

3.) I understand that this probably will get removed from the subreddit for some rule that I'm not aware of because that's how all of my posts go

4.) I know that the chance of Epic seeing this, reading through it, and making a change is very unlikely cause that's just how companies are (and the fact that Epic said that they wont be taking as many suggestions from Reddit)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that that's out of the way, let me get into why I think that the realease of season 9 has marked the worst time in Fortnite history.

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, lets talk about the pump situation. I'm certain when you read the title of this post that you knew this would be brought up but I felt like it still needed to be said. The pump shotgun being vaulted was a horrible **mistake.** Personally, I don't understand it. I thought everyone had enjoyed the pump and thought it was balanced. What happened, Epic? I don't want to sound whiney, but I feel like this is an important issue to be addressed. Once again, I know for a fact that Epic isn't going to make a change over just one reddit user's stupid post. But everyone knows about this issue so I'm going to move on to other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, the season 9 battlepass. In my opinion, this is just lazy. I still bought the battlepass because I wanted to support Epic games keeping this game alive. But the subject of the battlepass is long and needs to be separated into sections.

&amp;#x200B;

1.) the emotes: what happened here? One or two of these are decent, but the rest feel lacking of the usual quality and love that Epic puts into them. I don't know if you would consider these emotes, but the issue with emoticons and sprays also needs to be said. Who actually uses them? When you eliminate a person in an epic build fight are you really going to scroll through all your emotes to find that specific spray or emoticon? Or are you going to hit a flipping sexy or an orange justice? I know which one I'm picking.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) the skins: I actually don't have a huge problem with the skins this season, then why am I bringing them up? The poses. I have one question to ask about these: why were they needed? I've talked to my friends and they seem to have the same problem. This was also an issue that plagued season 8's Luxe. But the poses of Luxe and the rest of the season 9 skins just seem a bit off-putting to look at. From the start of season 7, I haven't used the battlepass skins as much because I don't enjoy looking at these characters do this weird pose while loading up to a game.

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Actually, I lied before, I do have a problem with **one** of the skins: Demi. I have no problem with people with disabilities playing video games, but tons of gaming companies that have a say in the gaming world have just been pushing it in our faces that they have disability representation in their work. I thought Epic would be free of this trope, but it seems not. The pose of this skin is even showing off the arm in front of her like ""look at me! I'm special! Epic Games has representation of disabled people!"" Once again, I have no problem with disabled people playing video games, my problem stems from the fact that gaming companies have shoved it in our faces. I'm really not trying to be insensitive and hateful, and I know a lot of people are probably going to make me feel bad about saying that, so before someone inevitably does, I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

That, I think, is all the points I want to cover. This is entirely my opinion and I'm not trying to force it upon any of you. But that is why I believe season 9 has marked an all time low for Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

So I am throwing this up here to the gaming community in hopes that someone might be able to help my son who is crushed. Essentially Epic Games held a big event launching the new season called the Loot Lake Event, that caused kids around the damn world to stay up until midnight to participate. When they did, they were supposed to get rewarded with some cool ""glider"" or something. Well when they got the glider, it began deleting items they had previously bought, weapons and stuff, and then deposited a bunch of V-bucks into their account.

So my son stays up all night (on a school night), gets his cool new items, and then ""earns"" a butt-load of V-bucks. And he is stoked! Then this morning he logs into his account to find all his v-bucks gone and items missing from his character that he had worked for. Meltdown ensued. I have reached out to Epic games, but I have received no response, and the only thing i have found online was this article:  [https://fortniteintel.com/epic-games-to-compensate-all-players-who-participated-in-the-fortnite-unvaulting-event-due-to-technical-issues/17122/](https://fortniteintel.com/epic-games-to-compensate-all-players-who-participated-in-the-fortnite-unvaulting-event-due-to-technical-issues/17122/) 

Anyhow, I figured I would throw something up here as I hate seeing my son bummed out over a game, but I get it.  Obviously I don't care about them taking back the ill-received 14,300 V-bucks, but they also removed the ""glider"" or whatever and a bunch of his skins.

This update was exactly what some of us have been waiting for.","First and foremost, a large percentage of this sub needs to take a breath. This is a game. You play it for entertainment. And if it‚Äôs no longer enjoyable, find a new game. Now onto my praises: 

I‚Äôve played since season 3, and I always feel like I‚Äôm behind the curve. Didn‚Äôt master double pump. Could get the pump to smg switch. Spray meta was never for me. Couldn‚Äôt counter rocket meta. And nothing, NOTHING has been worse than the late, (not so) great ‚Äúone pump‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm the player who lands, finds balloons, smoke grenades, and 36 ammo spawns in a house with a sweat and a pump. Countless games I‚Äôve landed, only to be one pumped back to the lobby. And it‚Äôs not fun. 

Some could say I have bad aim. (I do). But I hated pump shotguns. You miss your shot, and forget to switch to an smg, you‚Äôre probably dead. But not now. The game feel balanced. The game feels fair. I can land and even if the person gets a shotgun, there‚Äôs a chance I can fight back with an smg. It‚Äôs wonderful. 

The loot pool feels less crowded with pointless guns. In other words, no scoped nonsense. How many times did we land and find a gun we couldn‚Äôt use? 

The point is, this game favors certain players at certain times. Maybe season 9 isn‚Äôt your time? Maybe you miss the pump? That‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôre allowed. But realize there are millions of other players with different strategies and strengths out there. And this isn‚Äôt the end of the world. 

TL;DR. Thank you EPIC for evening the playing field by removing the pump, giving all players a more fair, less RNG based fight depending solely on aim. Thank you for removing guns that put players at a severe disadvantage off spawn. You guys are awesome.

"" Specifically when it comes to Pump Shotguns, they stand out significantly: they currently account for over 26% of eliminations in default playlists, with the next weapon type not even coming close. Rather than nerfing the Pump Shotgun to a point where it no longer lives up to its fantasy, our preference is to return it to the vault, giving us an opportunity to revisit the general balance of the item, while introducing a new shotgun. ""

It seems as though the primary reason for vaulting the pump shotgun is because it counts for roughly 1/4 of all player deaths. I don't see the problem for several reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The first obvious reason is that, as far as anyone can tell, the community was just fine with the pump shotgun. It's not a controversial weapon, like the Drum Gun; there's no meaningful movement to vault it. It's this isn't a change that the community was looking forward to. Epic seems to know this, given how they directly explained the new shotgun changes. You'd only do this if you're removing an item that you know the community wants. This is why we don't have any real explanation for why they removed, for instance, the Scoped Revolver. 
2. Secondly, a weapon type accounting for a large majority of kills doesn't make it an overpowered/unbalanced weapon. In the pump shotguns case, it's just a weapon that everybody uses, and the reason why is because most fights in Fortnite tend to be close-range, especially in the later parts of a match. A lot of people get killed by it because a lot of people use it. Why wouldn't people use shotguns? Why not use the best type of shotgun - the pump? You should expect to see numbers that high, if not higher. Imagine The Coalition removing the Gnasher from Gears of War because they see that it accounts for a large percentage of player deaths. 
3. This leads me into my next point, about the line '...the next weapon type not even coming close.' They use the phrase 'weapon type'. Well, the only other major weapon types in the game are Assault Rifle, SMG and Sniper Rifle. Sniper Rifles are difficult to use; I would be surprised if a significant chunk of the playerbase even prefers to use them, let alone consistently get kills. Assault Rifles work good enough, but remember - they have a lot of bloom, and players generally know how to build now. With the way engagements work in Fortnite, unless you can down someone off the rip (such as a sniper shot or melting them with an AR), the best way to finish them off is to get in close because they're putting up walls and stuff. This means that, as I said earlier, your most common weapon type is always going to be some sort of close-range weapon (shotgun or SMG) - and the pump shotgun is the best, so it's only logical that it's the most used weapon. We're not playing Red Orchestra, it's Fortnite, where you do a lot of building.
4. ""Rather than nerfing the pump..."" But what are you doing to it, then? You don't like the number of kills it gets. But you're not nerfing it. So... What are you even doing to it then? Buffing it? ""General balance,""? Given the way Fortnite is played, I don't see a world where the pump shotgun does not get nerfed, and yet you manage to even-out all weapon-type kills.
5. What are the percentages we should be looking for with weapon-types? Seventy-four percent of all deaths occur from non-pump shotgun weapons, I'm assuming. How can that number make a significant change without having a major affect on the way people play the game? I say this because the pump shotgun has pretty much been the most integral/important weapon in Fortnite since it started, and to get rid of it during the World Cup season seems outright odd to me. That's a big change to make during the World Cup I feel like, and I don't know if it's a good one.",FortNiteBR

Something needs to be done. Your game will die.

We are back in Season 5. Arguably the worst season of all time, the absolute worst.

 ‚Ä¢Drum gun 

‚Ä¢Compact SMG 

‚Ä¢Low damage shotguns 

‚Ä¢Insane mobility options

This is the formula for the end of your game. The removal of the Pump Shotgun has put this game on the brink, worse than siphon removal and stretched resolution ban. This has taken a toll on the community and I'm not sure what your plan is.

&amp;#x200B;

 The Pump Shotgun was perfected at the end of Season 6 and nobody was complaining at all. Sorry to speak the honest truth: The Heavy Shotgun won't fix it. It just can't, 192 max damage is not enough, 77 body shot is not enough. This is not good, something needs to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully something will come to fix this. Something big. This doesn't even mention all of the other unbalanced things in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

For Example: No building on slipstream, no building on skybase slipstream, shooting from a hoverboard in slipstream, the drum gun damage, unhealthy aggression from mobility increase, and most of lobby in ballers at the endgame.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just some of it, feel free to add to it. The things that should not be. I really hope this doesn't take the path of season 5, I'll be very dissapointed and upset if it does. Please, for the love of Fortnite, do something.",FortNiteBR

However, someone people said that ""suicide can be encouraged"", what? This is a game where you ""loot houses"" and shoot opponents , and we are here taking about suicide? Sure the naming would need some. Adjustment, but with that, it would be fine. 

Its annoying that parents of 9 year olds are complaining. GO READ THE INFO ABOUT THE GAME. IT'S RATED 12 or T in America. Don't complain that the game is violent when your child is clearly too young to play it. I'm glad epic just ignores these people and says mostly nothing.",FortNiteBR

 Hi there,

i eventually unlocked her today however, i did not get what locked challenges truly want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cos, when i hover over the battle pass and view the tier she is unlocked,  requirements are different from what i see as as soon as i click on the ""style"" tab and see the requirements of Vega locked challenges.

14,BackyZoo,1559244049,buxauv,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/buxauv/if_you_like_the_burst_smg_youre_basically_saying/,0,If you like the burst SMG you're basically saying that your aim is worse than RNG.,"""it's good if you hit your shots.""  


Such a stupid argument in favor of a gun that has some of the worst recoil and bloom I've seen in this game so far. Whether or not you hit a high damage burst is so heavily influenced by the RNG bloom mechanic Fortnite's guns have.  


There's no first shot accuracy, the bloom explodes to like twice it's size after the first shot and the recoil is ridiculous for a low damage, low rate of fire SMG.  


If you think the burst SMG is a better close range option than a white pistol, you're all but admitting that you prefer relying on luck over your own personal skill.  


It's a bad gun objectively and people need to realize that just because you like it, or have gotten lucky with it has absolutely no bearing on whether or not the gun is good. It's useless and I can't believe Epic removed one of the most balanced guns in the game just to add this.",FortNiteBR

1. Why when I kill someone can they come back over and over with full hp while my health is diminished each fight.
1. Why is it whenever I kill someone they spawn right over my head yet I spawn across the map when I get eliminated? Team Rumble teams should only spawn on their respective sides of the circle and meet in the middle.

This is probably due to the reticle on the combat being much smaller, as you can't even get a few pellets to hit if you just barely miss the head. It's a very rewarding weapon if you have precise aim.


Now look at the burst SMG. Once again, everyone is complaining that it's way worse than the suppressed SMG, but in reality it's an absolute monster if you can hit your shots. 24 DMG base shot and 43 DMG headshot means you can eliminate in an opponent with full sheild/health in around 1.2 seconds or less if you're precise enough.

Another reason I think people aren't realizing that these weapons are scary good is the fact that they are still being used as replacements. The Burst SMG did not replace the Suppressed (in terms of combat usage), and the Combat in no way replaced the pump (again in terms of combat usage). I think that maybe if more players started to use them as their own weapons instead of using them how the original weapons worked, they would get a lot more out of them and realize how good they really can be...that is, if you've got good aim.",FortNiteBR

OG means Original Gamer, meaning you were among the first populous to play a game. Fortnite ""OG"" is considered to be S1-S2, every skin released in this time frame could very well be considered ""OG"". Skull Trooper, Nog Ops, Recon Expert, etc, are ""OG"" skins because they were brought in the ""OG"" timeframe. (Theoretically)

That being said

EVERY SKIN RELEASED THAT DOESN'T GET RELEASED FOR 200+ DAYS ISNT OG, IT IS RARE.

Half Court Set was RARE
Leviathan Set was RARE
Powerchord was RARE

OG Players had Red Knight and Skull Trooper but they came in the Item Shop and they were RARE.

[JUST BECAUSE YOU FOUND THE GAME FIRST DOESNT MAKE YOU ANY MORE SPECIAL THAN PEOPLE WHO STARTED IN SEASON 3-9]

All skins released in the Item Shop are elligible to come back at any time unless it says otherwise

Stop complaining about your OG statuses and counter parts and start using proper terminology to justify why youre a spoiled kid who deserves everything he asks for

The skill level difference between new comers and the top players is vast, and as a result unless you have well above average skills you are unlikely to win a game anymore. The result has been people turning away from the core modes to predominantly playing rumble. 

A possible answer to address the skill imbalance in the core game modes (not arena or competitive) would be to implement a Handicap system. I.e. based on your past record of kills, wins, games played etc you would be given a health &amp; shield buff or nerf. As a beginner you would start with a 25% max health and shield bonus, I.e. a possible 125 health &amp; 125 shield. If on the other hand you are a pro level player you would find yourself with a 25% nerf I.e. 75 health and 75 shield max. This of course would be on an incremental scale with each level decreasing your max health and shield by 5 points. In core modes this would give beginners a chance against high skill players and of course would cause high skill players to dial down on their highly aggressive play style.",FortNiteBR

Why does epic add so many new guns? I understand why they do it, to keep the game ""fresh and fun"", but it's quite annoying. The guns, although some are cool, are still pointless. 
If they wanted to reduce the spray meta then they shouldn't have added the Tommy to the vote. And they shouldn't have removed all the guns meant for destroying builds.

I started playing this game 3 weeks ago and at first it was hard learning the mechanics when everyone was good but I still tried to play but recently this game has stressed me out more than being enjoyable. I fail to see the point of this game when all there is to do is just land and die 3  seconds later or randomly die 7 minutes later after you spent so much hard time looking for and farming materials.  

I bought the battle pass because the skins looked nice and and there was literally no other content besides getting 1 or 2 uncommon sprays which no one even bothers using. 

I tried looking at tutorials and practicing and got a little better, but my will finally broke last night. I wasted so much time grinding and grinding and grinding and this battle pass goes no where. The challenges are repetitive and minute so after you finish them you're left with nothing else to do. 

I even got my first victory royal about 4 days ago and I got nothing. Very little xp, no items, no nothing. Which brings me to the point what is even the purpose of winning if you just win and that's it you don't get a cool time you don't get any weapon skins you don't have  a chance of getting exclusive items if you win a certain amount in the season you, just, win. Usually there is an incentive to wanting to win, but there isn't, you just win and that's it... 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried creative and playground but I wasn't getting anything out of it and I'm already burnt out. The next worst thing which took some asking around to find out, I found the name for and have been constantly dealing with is this thing people call 3rd partying it really make me steaming mad when I waste all my materials and walk out of a fight with 1 hp. just to have no way of healing myself because no bandages or campfires and then another team glides down on you like marry poppins and shoots you once and you die. So you're basically left with 2 option hide until the number of people are small enough  to fight or choose to engage another team early into the game and 99% it will happen get third partied and die.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've played my fair share of loot box or aggressive monetization style games and I don't mind I understand the game is free and I don't mind supporting a game if it is fun and good. Spending money every so often doesn't hurt. But to tell me that the only way to get any type of decent item in the game is to spend around $12 to $15 constantly is crazy to me. I think a game is more than just how you look and after playing over-watch believe me I'm over skins. At the end of the day you're still bad. So that leads me to another point what is the point of playing the game? There is nothing to work towards they can only be bought, if you don't play passively you will most likely die very early, and even if you win you get nothing. No cool items no big boost to your battle pass giving you an incentive to want to play and win because you know you will get something great.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I had my little fun but this game is not fun or rewarding in anyway. I see it's just buy a skin for $15 or $20 every day.

&amp;#x200B;

To all those that play I hope you have fun, but I don't believe I will be playing this game anymore.",FortNiteBR

When it was Pump vs  Tac at least an argument could be made that the Tac has a faster fire rate than the Pump. But the Combat is literally just better than the Tac. Faster fire rate and tighter spread make it so you can hipfire and still hit hard. The Tac hits like a flower because the cross hair is huge. I'm so tired of dying to someone because they have a blue Combat Shotty off spawn while I get a lousy grey/green Tac Shotty. Also why was the shotgun spawn reduced? It's better if everyone can get their hands on the gun rather than be at a huge disadvantage cause of RNG on weapons spawn. The Heavy Shotgun is rumored to return and it's likely true because of the season 9 loading screen. Imo the Tac needs to get vaulted and the release of the Heavy needs to happen while also uping the spawn rate of Combat Shotguns.

I've been holding onto a clip that I've known is a bug for a long time now. I didn't know where I could post this that would bring the most attention to it. Until my friend told me to post it on Reddit. So here we are, I made an account just to post this. Hopefully it will help some of you and bring awareness to those who didn't know about it.

This happend at the end of last season. However this is still in the game and always has been. I want to start by simply explaining how the bug works. Keep in mind this could be one of the reasons why you don't get the elimination in certain situations, or die in other situations that you otherwise wouldn't have. (Example in the proof video)

Although some players may know about this bug, many players don't. I'm very surprised no one has brought this up because this is can potentially cost players, something a simple as a death or something as extreme as a world cup qualification.

**THE BUG:** The bug works like this, no matter what weapon slot your on. If you go from **pickaxe &gt; build mode**, the game will **FORCIBLY** throw you on the **first slot in your weapon loadout** upon exiting build mode. Instead of keeping you on the weapon you had selected before switching to your **pickaxe &gt; build mode**.

**Example 1:** You have your shotgun out. You go to farm a tree, someone starts to shoot at you. You turn around to build to stop the shots from hitting you. You would think that when you exit build mode you'd have your shotgun queued and ready to go right? **WRONG!** Whatever item that is first in your loadout will be selected. For most console players that's your Assault Rifle.

Now not all players run the same weapon loadout, this is true. However the point remains that if your expecting the same weapon that you had previously equipped to be pulled out, before switching to your pickaxe and going to build mode it will **NOT**. You will forcibly have the first item in your loadout selected. So again no matter what your loadout is, if your not on the first weapon in your loadout before switching to **pickaxe&gt;build mode.** The game **WILL** forcibly put you on whatever item is in that first inventory slot. That can throw you off mid fight no matter what loadout your on.

**Example 2:** Most pros like to run around with the Sniper Rifle out assuming they have one. **Simply because there is no switch delay, if the gun is already out.** Which can make sniping someone or getting an angle on someone easier/faster. Same thing if your running around with a sniper out (which is normally **NOT** a first loadout slot weapon) and you go to farm a tree, if someone shoots at you and makes you build while your trying to farm **(pickaxe &gt; build mode)**. You will be forced to the first inventory slot, which can throw off that sniper shot if your having to re switch back to the sniper.

**Example Video:** Since you all understand the bug and how it works now it will be easy to identify the bug in my proof video.

The clips starts off with me sliding down a hill rotating to the circle with very little mats. I notice my mats are very low so i try to farm the tree in front of me as much as i could, even taking some storm damage because of it. As i exit the storm i hear people gliding above me so I build up a little bit almost running out of mats. I see a player land on builds in front of me, I immediately pump him and knock him. Using the very last mat i have i build a ramp and make a *leap of faith type jump* pumping &amp; fully eliminating him in mid air.

**\*Here is where the bug begins\***

Like I said, completely out of mats I jumped and pumped him and mid air. When i landed on his loot I took my pickaxe out to loot him easier and more efficiently.**(For those who don't know its better to take your pickaxe out to loot mats,traps,ammo. Because your not dropping weapons on accident trying to loot, mats,ammo etc.)** After taking my pickaxe out to loot the players mats I started to get sprayed by a P90. I immediately try to build and realize I did not get much mats cause nothings really building. So I drop down to the low ground where some mats may have dropped. I see a player, so **I switch to my weapons from my pickaxe** expecting to have the **shotgun** out since it was the last weapon I had equipped. But because I went from the pickaxe when i looted, to build mode the game **forcibly** put me on the first inventory slot. Which for me happens to be my Assault Rifle. So instead of shooting the player with the purple pump. I shot the player with the AR which did **significantly** less damage and I get pumped instead and die. Not saying I would have 100% got the kill, but he was left on 41 Health so who knows.

That's pretty much it, I didn't want to make this post super long. I just wanted to explain this issue/bug and bring awareness to it, and also tell you how it may be affecting you. **Hopefully Fortnite will fix this or even address this.**

Can we please get some up-votes so they can see this. Would be huge for console players if this got fixed. I hope I explained this well please comment or let me know if there is anything you need clarification on.

***Thanks so much for reading!! &lt;3***

1) Choose the Downtown Drop LTM

3) WAIT FOR THE GAME TO START
4) As soon as the 3, 2, 1 countdown ends and the game begins you can use the menu to leave the game ASAP
5) Check your Fortbyte challenges!

Note: I play on mobile and every lobby I entered had ‚â§10 players so I had a 100% success rate but on other platforms you may have to try and wait for some people to leave if there happen to be more than 10

So me (18m) and one of my friends (19f) have been getting closer and closer recently and we both play Fortnite together. I go to her house a lot to play duos and to just hang about. So yesterday she phones me to come over for a game, just the norm right?

I get to her house (she has her own place), we talk and eat, then go to her room to play a game. The usual so far. Her PS4 was already on and ready to play, we sat down next to each other and had a couple games but we kept losing and didn't get any wins for many games.

This is where it gets juicy.

She told me she's getting bored of constantly losing and that we should do something else. I asked her what we could do and she literally just leaned into me and started kissing my neck whispering into my ear ""this"".

*oh shit this is happening*

So obviously we start making out and then you can imagine the rest. Actually don't.

But yea. Thanks Epic for making a great game, and for not only getting some action for the first time, but now a girlfriend.

I‚Äôm so absolutely sick and tired of getting right on in people face hitting them with 2 sometimes 3 perfectly clean shots and it doesn‚Äôt kill them. I‚Äôm sorry a shotgun should not require and 100% clean headshot to be effective. It‚Äôs a fucking joke you literally do everything right, out build them , close the distance converge on them get right up in their face pull the trigger 3 times hit all 3 shots, he pulls a drum gun kills me and is left with 33 health. There is no argument shot guns in this game are the most unrealistic part of it. I understand also the game isn‚Äôt going for realism but if thats the case why have the shotguns even look or be called shotguns because they clearly are more like pea shooting nerf guns at this point. Even when i dont die and win the exchange i find my self extremely annoyed because the fight was way more drawn out then it needed to be because the shot guns are so ineffective. Like honestly at this point either bring back one pumps or get rid of them entirely because at least getting one pumped up close makes sense when you‚Äôre using a shotgun. The whole point of shot guns are they dont shoot fast they dont have good range but the trade off being if you can get up close they‚Äôre devastating  and in this game they couldn‚Äôt be any further from that.",FortNiteBR

Might I point out though we have FOUR different assault rifles that are fully auto! And a Scoped Assault Rifle that has been in the game for more seasons than I have braincells. And yet they vault my favourite gun in the game... AGAIN.

It just makes no sense to me because the Tactical Assault rifle is more similar to a normal AR than the Suppressed is to a Three-round-god-damn burst SMG. A gun which is completely different to a suppressed and fully automatic SMG.

The Tommy Gun is unique in itself to exist along side the ARs and the SMGs. But seriously? 

It hasn't even been removed from the wrap selection screen as the showcase weapon.

To keep this simple, in the current state of the game there is a clear defined line between casual and competitive play. From LTM/Public matches to custom scrims and arena mode.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for you all today is this:

**Would you be upset if the casual and competitive sides of the game were balanced separately?**    


Meaning different loot pools, siphon/mats per kill, difference in vehicles, 100% loot spawns, etc etc.  


I would love to know what you think? Would having 2 fairly different modes be a turn off for you or would you be fine with having casual be the apple while competitive is the orange?",FortNiteBR

They won't bring back 50v50, they keep adding more and more mobility. They won't make wall edits transparent again. And they won't fix the loot pool and make it balanced. 

The entire game is a mess and a Frankenstein monster of how it used to be. 

I've been playing games for 20 years since Super Mario on NES was brand new. I know fun. I know what makes video games fun. And Fortnite was fun, but not anymore.

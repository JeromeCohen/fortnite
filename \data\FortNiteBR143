From all the bugs to the dumb stuff they add it just ruined the game for me and yeah I’m still gonna play because All my friends do but if they add an old school ltm or just a mode like that I’ll play again just as much as I used to. I just feel that the original reason people liked the game and why it got so popular is gone now so it’s just not as appealing anymore  ",FortNiteBR

I’ve gotten the Infinity Blade damn near every game I’ve played since it came out and it is nowhere near as OP as a lot of y’all make it. I think it’s a welcome addition and needs a slight buff to its Regen speed because it’s too easy to get pelted down by multiple squads.

But back to the real topic here, the anti build of season 7 is what most of y’all are truly complaining about. Planes are not OP in the slightest, but they are probably the 2nd best anti build item after the Infinity Blade. A plane can easily be shot down by 1 skilled shooter among other things. 

I am not a fan of building in this game at all and this Season is probably one of my favorites at the moment. If Epic could make Grapplers have actual reloadable ammo and add an Eplosive rifle somewhere down the line this season, it would hands down be the best imo.",FortNiteBR

Bloom is completely random bullet spread for those who don't know. It allows a day one player to lose to a new player regardless of skill. Epic has stayed quiet about bloom forever and that should change. Epic needs to remove bloom from the game and add spray patterns. This is a competitive game for a lot of people and every other competitive game has either spray patterns (cs:go) or 100% accuracy every shot while adsing (call of duty). 

https://youtu.be/-2KrcJBY51M 

This is a link to a video that shows a tiny portion of how unfair bloom is. The only thing good about bloom is that it gives new players a chance to win. But if you want that, put ranked matchmaking into the game. That's another thing that's been suggested for a long time. We need to get this removed from the game to push the game past the where it is now and move it into a better place.",FortNiteBR

\- Because of the **PUSH + PULL Technique**

**PUSH + PULL Technique:**

PUSH: Introducing an unfair/controversial item in the game to push players away from game and spark discussion/drama in the community. More DRAMA = MORE Fortnite gets attention = Kids talking about it in school = Gets more attention than other games = Game never dies 

PULL: They nerf the item or vault it and people are happy again + people don't fully quit their game. Or the people who quit the game, come back because it's now fair again. Balanced games = can get boring after 1 month. **Adding drama/controversy makes things exciting, as long as it's eventually nerfed...**

Examples: Fortnite is notorious for this, they did this with the Turrents --&gt; Made super OP in beginning (created drama + fortnite got more attention) --&gt; Then nerfed (people are happy). They did this with the zombies. They did this with introduction of double barrell shotgun... planes...season 4's double pump stage...trap damage in season 4....rocket splash damage... the list goes on

So WHY DO THIS TECHNIQUE? Because DRAMA/CONTROVERSY for a SHORT amount of time is actually what PULLs the audience in and keeps this game alive. It helps them generate more money/revenue because with controversy, more people will take about the game and keep this game alive in generating money. But Epic ALWAYS fixes/nerfs these items to PULL the players back into the game, it's what keeps the game fresh and alive.

**ONLY MY OPINION? What are your thoughts?**

The only time they'll be really fast with fixing an issue is if it's something like the free 35 tiers from last season.

Most people seem to hate that it's in the normal modes and think it should be given it's own LTM. I do agree to an extent, but overall I just don't care too much.

That being said, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in the people that run the official Fortnite competitive scene.

Not only was the sword bugged during the tournament yesterday, causing players to gain 100HP instead of 50, but it seems like whoever gets their hands on the sword ends up getting the most points.

In a tournament in general, I think that's pretty stupid and unfair.

However, if it was in the tournament from the very beginning of the tournament it wouldn't be such a big deal, but it wasn't. It was just added before the grand finals.. Like wtf?!

It's to my understanding that when a League of Legends tournament happens, they play THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT on ONE PATCH. They NEVER CHANGE THE PATCH MID TOURNAMENT... Because anyone that does that, would have to be fucking psychotic...

I've fully supported Epic from when I started playing. All the backlash they get from making all sorts of changes, I defend them... But THIS decision?? Just terrible!

""Hey guys... Welcome to the grand finals! Good luck to everyone, oh and there's a magical sword on the map right now that if you can get your hands on, you'll probably get the most points in that game without any effort or focus. Just right-click and left-click and you will win!""

Dear Epic: If you ever create items or game changing mechanics in the future, please leave them OUT OF A TOURNAMENT UNTIL THE TOURNAMENT IS OVER! Sure, include them in the next tournament, but, FROM THE START. Not at the VERY end with $500,000 worth in prizes on the line.

All these players have been practicing and playing WITHOUT the sword(or airplanes for that matter, but whatever on those,) and for the patch to drastically change so much JUST for the grand finals, is truly a kick in the balls to e-sports.

Very unprofessional.

I'm all for changes, but this is a tectonic shift. Clearly Epic is a business and this content update is a brilliant marketing move. New players are now more likely to pick up the game due to the recent changes, leading to growth in the player base. However, these particular changes significantly alter the game we all know and love.

I understand that a lot of people like the changes, but the sword is absolutely horrendous. The planes really do not bother me... It's the ""everyone land at polar peak and fight for the sword"" part that ruins the game for me. Yes, you can eliminate a player with the sword but it's difficult to do in late game situations, especially if a half-decent player has the sword and you're getting 3rd partied in the process. And no, I do not want to land snow biome every game for the opportunity to 1) get the sword (it's boring gameplay and dilutes the joy of getting a win) or 2) catch the sword wielder off guard and avoid that late game scenario. Some folks might suggest that the ""everyone land at polar peak"" trend will dissipate, but the sword is too crucial in mid- and late-game scenarios.

Also, one of the best components of the game is the opportunity to clutch the win for your team when they go down, and that opportunity is effectively eliminated now unless you have the sword in your possession or if it's entirely out of play (which hardly happens).",FortNiteBR

\-Make it so every time a plane boosts through a building, that plane take a bit of damage

\-Planes should have a shortened boost (Not by much)

\-Instead of knocking someone with your plane and doing damage to them, if you knock into someone they will automatically board your plane

\-You should be able to build around a plane (Currently it will destroy my builds even when not moving)

Ziplines:

\-Make it so there is a key to get onto the zipline

\-Give us an option (not defaulted) to use a certain key to jump while using a zip line, as some of us accidentally jump while ziplining

Infinity Sword:

\-Lower the damage per swing to 50 instead of 75

\-Lower the user health to MAX 150 Health and 150 Shield when using the sword

\-The ""jump attack,"" needs to have a cooldown

\-Why isn't it in an LTM?

Futureproofing:

\-Before releasing items into BR version, add and LTM in which you can test each item so we can give you guys feedback

In the competitive scene, especially one where it was meant to give the no names a chance to prove that they are the best in the world, should have been more focused on the smart plays. The plays that players just do because they can. Sure he had a couple of great plays. It just felt like Fortnite missed out on a great gameplay stream and not another Ninja stream.

We aren't giving them the credit they deserve. Yes the sword is overpowered and needs to be removed. Yes planes need a hotfix. However, in order for the game to stay relevant Epic has to continue to push out new, and game changing items, and weapons. They just released a new season and for the most part it's been amazing. I can't imagine the pressure these devs feel due to the fact that the most popular game in the world is in their hands. These guys aren't perfect, they're gonna mess up. But like I said they do an amazing job at keeping this game at the top. I've never seen a game with developers that are so connected with the community. So with that being said, thank you Epic for this amazing game.

Firstly, following the Winter Royale meltdown (pun not intended) its become obvious that Competitive Fortnite as an epsort is very far from being ready. In the current META (if you can even call sitting in a plane with a mythic Sword a META) the huge prize pool /production is merely just a marketing stunt. Even if you barely play this game, you must have some sympathy for the poor bastards who play 12 hours a day training , practicing, perfecting tactics and rotations, to be mopped up in the final circle by some guy spamming ""SWISH"" with a god sword. I'm sure a lot of people have seen the reactions on twitter and some posted to this sub, Bizzle brandishing the game as a joke, Chap spelling out his SaC name mid-qualifier whilst sword-holding, even the golden boy Ninja commenting on it not being ""what we qualified for"", saying he doesn't even want to play it out after being targeted by ""Team Plane"". Feel free to go and watch Chap's 2nd to last VOD on Twitch for a better insight as to why this is the worst Fortnite competitive has ever been.

As for the rest of us, mere mortals, public games. Some of you may still be enjoying the games, but I can almost guarantee that after 20-30 games you won't be. How many times in a row can you land at Polar Peak? Want to land elsewhere? Have fun seeing nobody for 2 circles, half the lobby dead before the bus ejects the AFK players, and a run in with a sword wielding maniac towards the end of the game. I kiLlEd HiM wItH BaLlOoNs !1!. We get it, you killed a bot who had the sword and got your clip. How many times is that repeatable without getting beamed third party within 10 seconds? People complained that even if re-deploy would take up a slot that they weren't willing to sacrifice one, but now you give one up for fucking balloons? Sometimes ""adapting"" strives so far from the actual game its better to just admit that something needs to change, not you. The objective has changed from winning a Fortnite game, to getting an Infinity Blade. This kills almost all variety in gameplay, and makes it even more stale than if nothing had been added in the past month. Of course, the overwhelming feedback from the community and content creators is ""make an Infinity Blade LTM"" but who knows, turrets are still here right?

I didn’t start playing until after the infinity gauntlet was in fortnite, but I was told by many players that it was a fun mode. I agree with most people that the blade needs to have its own LTM but I don’t think EPIC should completely remove it. It’s just another reason for players to strategize and find ways to eliminate the player with the blade. That’s what I like about this game. It’s constantly changing so players have to adapt. I do feel that the blade should have been removed from winter royale though. The blade was too big of an advantage in a tournament that had such a large amount of money on the line.

At the start of each game have a roll of the dice and make a few eligible of the 100 in one match (but don't tell anyone). That way it may or may not even be used and won't be just passed from one person to another. It will be more of a special event when someone is able to remove it from the castle and not just passed around like a hot potato. I love that epic is trying new things and hats off to them for trying new things the community may be for or against and just wanted to give my suggestion on how to make it more tolerable.

- Keep distance.

The jump is barely controllable and you can easily just jump towards the person with the sword and they will straight up leap over/under you. The biggest mistake people make against it is building, as building will do virtually nothing for you and will just make it easier for the person with the sword to get to you.",FortNiteBR

Building:
In tournaments limit building materials similar to in the pop-up cup maybe 500 of each or slightly less

Points:
Put more incentive on kills i.e
1 point for every two kills

More incentive in first place
3rd gets 1 point
2nd gets 2 points
1st gets 5 points 

These would mean there are less materials for people to just sit in 1X1’s and it is more economical to go for kills as its more likely too get 2 kills every game that get third place this will cause more fights making it more entertaining for the viewership?

As Tfue said on his stream today, if Epic Games were to keep the game the way it was back in season 1-3 as of items and builds, a lot of players who don't grind the game to get better at it would've already left. Yes, this is true, due to the majority of players who actually don't grind this game to get better are casuals who play for the sake of playing. As someone who has been grinding multiple hours a day, everyday, I feel like this game caters to those with the best RNG rather than of skill. The fact that planes, dynamites and now this sword is in the game, it's crazy to think how many casuals actually body you just from doing nothing. 

Planes currently can hit you for over 70 damage, disregarding that they also can hit you off the ground for more fall damage, dynamites are currently way too good for how bad mats are since the nerf a season or two ago. And this sword just counteracts everything Fortnite has been about. 

No matter what people have said about, how fun this game is compared to before blah blah blah, you can't defend yourself and say that good players will always find a way to win fights, because as of now, building to protect yourself is pointless against these items that has been added to the game. Only the sheer will of your aim can help you now, and even then, the rng of bloom comes into play.

So I normally never say a thing or keep my opinion to myself but I wanted to throw an idea out there. Not sure if something like this has been posted before, I couldn’t find anything. 

In my opinion and a bunch of people around me agree, epic should put a big break on adding content and actually start fixing the game. 
This is just feedback from someone that started playing this game pre seasons and have experienced all the changes made.

First and foremost, the servers. When the ping info got added (I believe this was season 2) I had a 9 ping. I haven’t changed my internet at all (which is more then decent, EU server)  and yesterday I hit 50 ping. There was an update at a certain point where they stated they improved server stability. 
I think there needs to be a good look at this point because I feel like that every content update is making the servers more laggy, which for example is that when achieving the victory royale it lags so bad that you don’t know what’s going on...

Second, are some of the items that are added recently. I understand that meta changes all the time which is fine by me. 
I do believe, that planes need some changes, I feel like you shouldn’t be able to just fly through structures without taking any damage. IMO it should have a high risk, high reward kind of feel to it. That you need to take damage if you want to do stuff like that. Good example is the Winter Royale semi finals from yesterday, the amount of times that someone just flew through structures, got a kill without any harm to themselves was insane to me, especially because of the fact there is a gun on top which will help the player/plane as well. 

I’m loving the mobility that has been added, with the plane/quadcrashers/ziplines and all the other stuff but please take a look at it. 

Last but not least, the Infinity sword. To me this should be an LTM like the Thanos Glove LTM. This item should not be in normal game modes and especially not in the competitive modes. (Like the Winter Royale/Pop Up Cups) 

I’m only taking my time to post this because I absolutely love this game and I might get a lot of hate on this one but hey, that’s part of the deal right? 

Thank you all for taking the time to read this, I would love to hear your opinions. 

Sending peace and love. ",FortNiteBR

First of all, I want to introduce myself. I started playing Fortnite back in season 2. Fortnite is the first online shooter game since 2013 for me. The build mechanics, the fact that it is free (so a lot of friends were playing already), the fun aspect and the feeling that each game you have the same chances as the other players to win (not pay to win) bring me back to the online gaming world.

Then after playing for months, I started watching the competitive scene. For me, as a huge sport enthusiast, I was watching for the really first time esport and I was surprisingly enjoying it! The rest of the story is similar to a lot of people here. I continued to play (maybe 10-15 hours a week) and enjoyed the game months after months, change after change. I also started following pros just to improve my play!

Suddently, in October, something like Fortnitemare came out. During 1 week, the core of the game was drastically changed. Enough to me to play less and wait until the end of the event. Then, the redeploy test was in place. Game was still playable, but I was again getting bored to play my favorite game of the recent years. Hopefully it was a test. After that, oh no, the turrets! They were fixed, but were way too frequent at the beginning and made the game unenjoyable again. 

Finally, the season 7 came. Really hyped about the great map changes. Planes are a little bit OP, but the real issue like the turrets is the quantity available, not the item itself. A quick fix should balance the game again. Then, came 7.01 update. A sword added to the game. Nice LTM, I told myself... oh wait, it's added to the main playlist!

Epic Game, please stop drastic changes like that. We pardoned you for Fortnitemares, the Turrets, some gun meta, but the sword change is something that will piss off your real fan base. Why changing drastically the core of a game that is so popular? People will not start playing a Battle Royal because of a unique unbalanced item that does'nt fit at all in a game like that! What happen in your mind?!?!

Finally, regarding the competive scene, I felt betrayed again as an esport fan watching the winter royal. You can't introduce an item like the sworld in the middle of a tournament! I was watching Fortnite Competive scene more often than my favorite hockey team this year, but yesterday I realised that your comp scene is just a  a joke. A total disrespect for the viewers, but even more for the pros that had hours of training fort this! I feel sorry and was pissed for all the players in the semi-final.

Please stop doing stupid move like that and just stay the game we all fall in love it.

Regards,

A fan that worry about the future of this game.

I would like to give you some statements why it should be removed from the game.

1. Every Game at least 10-20 people jumps on the hill where sword spawn and they die within 5 minutes from the start
2. When the first storm is pushing circle 1 there is only 30-40 players left in the whole map
3. Talking about sword itself it's a huge struggle to kill someone who uses it when playing duos/squad, you have to fight a bastard with an insane speed, 75 damage each hit, when another team or person is shooting you from different side on the map.
4. The thing that you can jump instantly after every landing is just insane, at least they had to make some kind of a cooldown.
5. Damage should be 50 per hit without health or shield regeneration, most of people just hide and camp to regenerate their shield in late games and then they just destroy you.
6. When using the sword running speed should be decreased instead of increasing it, the sword is huge so it should slow you down alot.
7. Player who kills someone should get 50 health/shield instead.

That's just some minor ideas from my perspective, yesterday i played solos/duos/squad's with my friend's and i can say that the game is FOR SURE not that fun anymore when they added the sword. I was really hyped for season 7 when it droped, it looked that the game just as good as it was from the start. Now i can only say that i will quit the game until it gets removed....

Building was the very essence of this game. Imo that's what made this game having such a high skill ceiling experience for players who love to play competitive games.

I love that Epic keeps updating the game but they should it so it doesn't affect the very essence of this game. 

Building is getting more and more countered and, in the end, the game is looking like a huge rng mayhem where being skill doesn't gets rewarded anymore.

Even if you have the greatest aim, you'll need to protect yourself from your surroundings, but guess what, there's little to no time to even shoot when your buildings gets destroyed every 2 seconds. You have grenades, dynamites, rpgs, grenade launchers, turrets, airplanes, graplers, snipers camping and now the sword.

Why should you take any fights? Since season 7, like 90% of the fights I had, solo, duos or squads, I ended 3rd partied. That's fine, if I could damn build some protection.

There's a high risk, little reward in fighting right now. And there's a 0 risk HIGH reward in 3rd partying with a plane, sword, wtv.

Its one of the main things that keeps me interested in this game. However there are many times when a new mode/item is introduced and the consensus of those who post here is that it should be immediately removed/vaulted. Maybe this has been suggested before but how about a mode that doesn't implement any new ideas until they have had time to settle in.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only would this allow you to play the game the way you like, you could actively protest changes you hate by exclusively using this mode and call for others to do so if you wish. Epic would have the stats to see when an idea is not working out. I guess it would need to include all game types (Solo, Duo, Squad) so no-one is left out of their preferred play style. Tournaments could use this mode to maintain some consistency sometimes when needed. New ideas that are added that you guys think are OK would be added after a testing period in the regular modes.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this might not gain traction here, but it might offer a positive solution for those of you who hate to see the game try radical new things. It seems a shame for new ideas to be killed in less than 24 hours by a vocal majority on here, before anyone can adjust and actually test out new things.

&amp;#x200B;

I leave it to you to decide what you could call it. Maybe ""Legacy Mode"" or ""Stable Mode"". I'm sure someone could think of something.",FortNiteBR

Epic it’s time you start being transparent. I’m a sucker for honesty and if you came out and told all of us dedicated players that you don’t care to create a properly balanced game and would rather focus on a casual and fun viewing experience game then I’d stop complaining. But instead you stay quite and host these multi million dollar tournaments and advertise this game as also being a competitive and eSports ready game, which it is very, very far from

Be honest with the community. If I knew that you could give 2 shits about me and my passion for a properly balanced game, than I’d keep my mouth shut because I’d know you’d never listen. Until that comes, I will shit all over every bad decision you make.",FortNiteBR

I feel really sorry for everyone that dedicated time into this tournament... Seriously, some ppl even quit school or other jobs to try earning money with this game...

Adding something gamechanging and metabreaking the same day a BIG TOURNAMENT happens!?

Let's be serious guys... There is no counter play to this:

You can jump over when planes try to Go over you

You can destroy all buildings close in one click

You regenerate health overtime + when getting elims

Yeah... I'll have to agree, this was the biggest joke in all esports time!

No we don't need Season 2 back. You guys only want Season 2 and 3 back because it's the season with the first games you've played and you were still experiencing with the game. It's just nostalgia.

\-  Turret floor health stays the same at 1000HP.

\-  From now one, every time you overheat a Turret, it, along with its floor, will take exactly 250 damage. Additionally, the Turret will automatically overheat every second time you reload the machine, thus enabling any player to respectively use the Turret 8 times before its automatic destruction.

\- Turret's reload time will remain the same at 5 seconds.

\- Instead of dealing a max total of 150 damage to nearby opponents, the Turret will now have THREE STAGES for shooting:

STAGE ONE: When you first start spamming the Turret, it will respectively do a max of 37 damage to enemy players.

STAGE TWO: 1-2 seconds after this, the Turret's damage will then increase to a total of 45.

STAGE THREE: 2 seconds later, the Turret will do a final damage of somewhere between 83 - 87 before either accidentally or automatically overheating.

I remember reading the comments and people were saying everything was perfect balanced and they were ""screaming"" not to change anything since shotgun damage is an issue since season 3 . 
Yet some people were saying that the current state of fortnite is the best since in a long time . 

I have to agree and disagree with them.  
Smg weapons are actually pretty good . 
Shotguns are in the best state they ever were .
Rpg weapons pretty balanced . 

BUT planes ? Really epic ? 
Being in a squad game is not fun at all anymore . A squad comes in a plan and start spraying on you tons of damage while destroying your buildings instantly which cause you take fall damage . And all of that in such a short time which makes it impossible for you to react or do anything.  

I can't think of a way of this being actually a balanced and a fair thing to be into the game . 

Maybe if the take the gun out of the plane . Maybe it will be more stable .

They're a great addition to the game and make the season feel more exciting. It adds so much more to gameplay now, and adds for a whole new area of enjoyment. But I also feel like maybe they are  too difficult to fight. Almost every encounter i have had with a person flying a plane (in a solo, which is hugely different than fighting a single plane with a whole squad) has ended in my getting totally mauled. The idea of having a way to get around in the air is amazing, and im really glad it was pulled off, but having this, combined with a turret on front (which has been complained since release to be vaulted), and the ability of a quadcrasher feels totally unfair against a single player with a grey assault rifle. The plane has so much health to take, along with having to take on the player themselves, including having to deal with the barrage of turret streams coming at you, only to be rammed by the large body of the plane, which is difficult to dodge in my opinion, and take so much health, along with knocking you back a good distance. All this in one machine feels far too overpowered. I understand that the pilot has some disadvantages as well, but these don't nearly compare to the disadvantage of the opposing player. I don't have any good ideas of nerfing the plane, but i know it does need a nerf. With the recent nerf, taking 25 health to the pilot at destruction, it feels like only a tiny bit of it has been balanced. What needs a balance is the plane's fighting ability, not defensive. And apologies to all those out there who feel like the ""slow speed"" of the plane is already a disadvantage of the plane, and that this is just me being bad at the game, but this is only what I feel is fair.

Change my mind.,"I feel like now that there are a lot more people playing now, they should input some sort of SBMM for solos. Maybe nothing too intense, but a player with 0 wins won't find it fun to play against a player with 2000 wins. And players with 2000 wins get no benefit from playing with players with 0 wins. I've heard the excuse that people ""can't get better if they play against people of there own skill level."" But that isn't true. In seasons 1 and 2 the players where terrible. All of them. There where no pros. Also, pro players seem to hate the idea of catering to players who aren't good. So why not stop making crazy changes to the game and instead having some kind of skill based matchmaking based off of a similar system to the pop up cups. But, it would work like cross play. If you are low rank, then you could play with anybody. Of you are medium rank you can play with medium and high ranked only. If you are high ranked you can only play with high ranked lobbies. This would mean that poor players would have to opt into playing with pros who can not opt in to playing with noobs. That would make gameplay much more stable for everyone and allow those who want to work their way up the opportunity to. Duos and squads would remain unchanged though. This allows for players to play with people at their skill level and not have to worry about pros. It would also allow players to generally all have a similar experience based on their skill level. They would all have to try pretty hard but would not be getting absolutely demolished every game and would be able to grow in skill. ",FortNiteBR

Everything about The Visitors motivations, what happened to the rocket and most importantly, what Kevin was will make sense at the end of the season but he hasn’t told me any of that yet. All he really said was Epic are planning a MASSIVE event at the end of the season that will change the map majorly. 

During season 7, the Durr Burger truck will create a time machine made from technology in the little shacks with A.I.M’s logo on it. It is later revealed in loading screens that A.I.M is a robot made during the war that was send forward in time. Towards the end of the season, the Durr Burger truck slowly transforms in to a time machine and that’s when the event happens. The Durr Burger time machine activates and causes the whole map go back in time, showing all of the events that happened in the past go in reverse and then, right at the end, a meteor flies out of Dusty Divot. once the meteor goes out of sight, the Durr Burger time machine explodes and the game continues, in Season 3’s map.

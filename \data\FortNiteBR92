Why?

Because the feature would work soooo much better in Fortnite.  

Fortnite is a significantly slower paced game.  Players frequently see enemies 10+ seconds before engaging with them on the approach.  Gun fights last significantly longer in Fortnite and skins are much more distinctive in Fortnite as well.

#This weeks topic is: **Zombies**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Zombies to base your conversation on. They have been in and out of the game a few times now and we think they deserve to have a potential overall feedback post. potential talking points are:

* Is it a more efficient way to gain loot and materials or are there better ways of looting?
* How much of an impact do zombies have late game, in terms of gameplay?
* Are they more of a useful asset to the game or an inconvenience?
* Could the spawn rate be adjusted for certain points within the game, if so, how much?
* Should loot drops from zombies provide more or less loot to provide balance?

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

I like this, a lot of people seem to like this, however, something a lot of people don't like is that this new system encourages the instant elimination of players as soon as they are knocked out (commonly referred to as thirsting).

I have an idea that would discourage thirsting as it would reward players who decided to savour their victory. 

While a player is in the Downed But Not Out state (DBNO) they lose 2 health points every 1.2 seconds. My change would see the player who DBNO'd a player gain 1 effective health every 1.2 seconds. This would force players to make the tough decision to risk letting a player survive and be revived or to regain some health that I'm sure would be useful for taking out the remaining members of the squad. This change would also encourage team mates to revive their fallen comrades to keep their enemies from regaining health. When the last player on a squad is eliminated, the remaining health should still be rewarded to the respective players.

Would you like to see this change occur? Are you happy with how the system currently is? Do you just want to see it reverted entirely? Did you have a different idea? I'm curious to read what you all think.",FortNiteBR

I’d like to think I’m a slightly above average player, and because I’m not a professional player that has a 7.0 K/D, I rarely won. With the pop-up cup settings added to normal game modes, it now increases the skill gap, rewarding good players, and punishing bad / under average players. For the past few games I’ve gotten into the final circle and it was so intimidating at first! 9 people in the final circle, I thought, usually there would be only 2-3! The way games play out, most of the time the best players end up top 10, instead of dying early-game due to not finding shields, or something like that. Now in late game, it gives you the thrill of an intense fight, not the chills down your spine, about being worried where the other 2 players could be for example. There might still be some things to fix in Fortnite, but Epic really outdid themselves this time. Also, improving turbobuilding, nerfing the RPG to make it rarer, it really just adds the cherry on the cake. I hope you guys agree with me, and if not I’d be happy to know why!",FortNiteBR

I mean I get the memes and the bandwagon on hating something that's popular but what's really wrong with it? There are so many different Battle Royale games and all of them are unique. 

To win in Fortnite, you need to learn weapon blooms and building; the techniques, offensive, defensive etc. Apex requires knowledge on classes and abilities and specific attachments(prowler full auto attachment) to win. In PUBG, to win you need to learn bullet speed, bullet drop and scope usage. In Survival Games you have abilities, chest looting, bow and potion skill. 

They're all quite different but Fortnite is the one that gets hit, is it only because it's popular or is it because people don't want to learn how to build to win. IMO comparing every BR game mode, Fortnite is definitely the most time consuming one to learn, Apex is relatively easy, PUBG needs just a little practise and Minecraft SG barely needs any time practising. 

I hear some people hate Fortnite because it's dominated by kids. I understand what they mean because it really is but you're not forced to play with randoms, just get a few mates and that trouble goes away! 

Or is it just edgy and cool to hate on popular games?",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Upon initially reading the patch notes for 7.40, I was excited. Nobody likes dying because they came out of a battle with 20 HP left, so getting back 50 health per kill sounds great. And it is - for the best players. See, there's a reason Epic avoided putting the siphon setting into normal modes until now, and that reason is that it overwhelmingly benefits skilled players. Now, I'm not here to say that skill should not be rewarded, but we need to keep in mind that there are plenty of players who don't take this game as seriously as others do - the players who are excited every kill they get and who still experience that childlike glee of earning a Victory Royale. Those are the players this change hurts. Applying Pop Up Cup settings to public lobbies ensures the death of the casual player by overly rewarding the already skilled players with HP and mats, effectively widening the skill gap that we've heard complaints about and turning public lobbies into Pop Up Cups. I'm sure if you're not one of them, you've at least heard them - the people who wish for when times were simpler, have nostalgia for Season 2, etc. The siphon change is the nail in the coffin for those players. Why would they continue to play a game where people who are already better than them get rewarded exponentially? The answer is simple - they won't. And with that, any notion of Fortnite being a casual, fun battle royale game is dead. I understand that the community is excited about these changes, but for a moment, please step back and consider how this change will affect the meta and player base as a whole. ",FortNiteBR

This is probably not accurate but I thought I may suggest a reason for the fissures and earthquakes.

Also this is all may of bin caused by the sgt. winter controlling the icebergs movement and causing it to crash into the island subsequently causing polar peak to melt.",FortNiteBR

The 50 percent reduction to max materials is a phenomenal way to admit Epic understands that complaint and they fed it to the hardcore community the way a Mom tricks her kids into taking their medicine.  You slip it in their soda.

Epic appeased the hardcore community by giving us syphon health upon killing an enemy but mark my words.  This won't stay in the game.

Epic will swap syphon out with a better fix (more shields) but will keep 500 max material in the game.

The deagle nerf was MUCH needed as well as planes. The interact button with ziplines was a great addition &amp; shield/mats per kill takes away some of the RNG of this great game. Now for the material cap... I for one was very excited for this change however after playing Squads (Fill) all day yesterday I'm a bit disappointed. I think with the progression of building within' the average player, more than 1500 total mats in a squad game is required. I consider myself to be an average player with about 400 total wins &amp; when I run into a decent squad with splodes/minigun I still sturggle with only 1500 mats. Now my original suggestion is that there be a 500 material cap in solos, 750 in duos, and back to regular 999 in squads. I'm not sure if this would be a balanced amount of materials, I just do know that a 500 material cap is not cutting it in Squads. There is A TON of great builders out there &amp; I find it frustrating outbuilding two really good players while the other two shoot me down &amp; now I'm low or completely out of materials.

Perhaps a smaller buff is warranted than the one suggested, let me know how you guys feel in the comments?

I’m spending more time farming now than I did before because I have to search for stone and metal in order to compete with people who landed at places where it is abundant.

In my opinion, a good balance would be 800 wood, 500 brick, 300 metal. It would allow for more mats farming, not having too much metal to which you are basically unstoppable, and make farming wood worth it again.

They're promoting more aggressive and fast gameplay while not giving you the essentials you need to survive multiple people in a row. If you land at honestly any major point of interest and take on an engagement with an enemy or another team odds are a third party will be along in seconds to try to get shields or health. If you are only give 30 ammo off of a floor spawn weapon or chest at what point does that make sense to have you set up to be taking these multiple fights back to back. Either increase that rate at which you farm to maybe give you the chance to just get out of the situation and or turtle to more ammo or give us an adequate amount of ammo to be able to take on multiple people.

Now the other thing i saw (before the update) was that a lot of people kept complaining about planes. That's nothing new. But cmon guys...planes are PLANES. not some fuckin jelly that flies...they ram into a structure made of WOOD (WHILE BOOSTING BTW) and barely even do anything to it...now i know it was annoying to have planes crash into things and make you fall but the nerf before that made the planes weaker by getting tons more dmg done to them...also 50 dmg penalty if youre crushing into a building or house...its just gonna get insta destroyed. there wasnt really a point in making them even weaker than that was there?? now if you do some stupid shit with your plane and get stuck...well sorry but your only transport is now gone. Ive even seen people complaining (after the recent update) to remove the guns from them...like are you fuckin serious? the only way to kill somebody with a plane now and you want it gone? the planes would be basically just glider redeploy and fast movement...nothing good can come out of that... so thats it...i dont want to fucking drag this post on for eternity. 

Anyway, hope you enjoyed my rant about your rants and complaints...since its about complaints i guess i should flair this as sub feedback...",FortNiteBR

Season 6: Wailing Woods was given four houses, teleporters and an infinite rift. Loot Lake has changed from being mainly water to now containing lots of land.

Season 7: Flush Factory and Greasy Grove were overhauled with snow and with that came the snow biome with 3 new POIs. Happy Hamlet, Polar Peak and Frosty Flights.

Remaining Season 1 POIs: Wailing Woods, Lonely Lodge, Retail Row, Salty Springs, Fatal Fields and Pleasant Park

Did FN fix this or something so you can't repeat the same match or maybe they're working on fixing Creative Islands?? I'm someone who literally doesn't care about this mode whatsoever, but I thought the challenge would go much faster than it apparently seems.  Playing the same map and having it go all schizo every time is annoying, especially when getting coins don't count.

I want to assume others were having the same problems, but apparently seems like everyone is having a much easier time doing this than I am. Is there something I'm doing wrong?

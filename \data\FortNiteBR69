Can we just all accept that different people enjoy the game differently? Casual players and competitive players both have their own definitions of fun, and that's perfectly fine. There are ways to make both parties happy. It seems like every suggestion related to balance or the state of the game always ends up in a huge shitfest of ""DAE SWEATS BAD"" or ""just get good at building loooool"". 

For the more casual players: you're not doing yourselves any favors by making posts like ""sWeAtS ArE RuInINg ThE gAmE"" when you could be saying ""I don't enjoy being put up against players clearly better than me, I feel like I have no chance. Can we please get some changes to the queue system?"" or ""Could Epic please balance separately for cups?"". Trust me, as a new player, I completely understand you. It sucks to get obliterated and feel helpless. But at this point, all ""sweat"" means is ""someone who's better than me"" or ""someone who's playing to win"".

For the better and more competitive players: You don't like certain things in pubs, and that's fine. However, Fortnites playerbase is very, very casual, so keep that in mind. Something that Epic could do to satisfy you guys (imo) would be to a) Make cups more frequent. b) Add incentives to pay the cup, which could possibly reduce Q times. and c) Make changes for the cup mode only, which they have done in the past, just not to items. Again, I'm relatively new and not that competitive with Fortnite, so I could have a completely wrong idea.

These suggestions might not be the best, but it's nearly 12 AM here and I wanted to get some thoughts and feelings off my chest. ",FortNiteBR

Start the match looking for a hamster ball, the best spots to look are any of the expedition outposts.

While the rest of the lobby kills each other, including your squadmates most likely, spend your time roaming around with the ball avoiding fights and looking for balloons. Avoid named locations, loot chests in areas like the umbrella cave, the crashed bus, Tomato ruins, etc. Any explosives or a heavy sniper is also helpful.

When you've got what you need (or not, balloons aren't exactly raining from the sky, you may have bad luck occasionally), wait at a van inside your hamster ball (it's a 300 health bubble around you, can't get sniped) and if a team starts building up to it, take out their ramp with your grenades/heavy sniper.

Take their jewel, use your balloons under the van, and 1x1 walls around you as you float up to the van.

Ta da, you win. 

Getting the jewel is going to be the most difficult part, but the strategy itself is relatively stress free. If you can't get it done, no worries. Try again. In my experience this strategy is rather beneficial to casual players, as it allows you to have a decent shot at winning the match on your own, regardless of your teammates performances (or lack of performance lol). 

Also you might not always find balloons. That's fine. You're still capable of destroying a team's build and ramping up to the van, but there is a risk of dying from fall damage if someone spots you. 

Good luck! 

PS: You don't have to take out an enemy team to get a jewel. If it's late in the game, with only a handful of teams remaining, you can always collect a jewel on your own at the edge of the storm circle. Just make sure it's secure before you exit your hamster ball.

Thing is people will likely disagree.

Limiting building materials to 250. Yep, 25 structures a material type, 75 structures in all. Hear me out before you say I'm trying to kill building.

In a typical build Battle, one can use hundreds to thousands of materials (placing well over 100 structures) if they're sweating for a kill. These players won't let a gunfight happen unless they're either above you or in a 1x1 with you. 

Try doing that with 750 Max materials. You can't spam build or do complex battles anymore. Of course you can still Battle with builds, but you can't just mess up a few builds and be ok. You need to build very strategically to not waste your materials.

Obviously you still could do giant build battles, it's still enough to build like that. But you can't just rush after rush after rush. You need to farm after each giant Battle. Only sweat build when you need to, which the best idea would be to do it in the endgame.

When you're in a top three or top five situation, circle small enough that you can see the entire thing, that's when to give a final push, sweat for the last kills to win the game. Because at that point it's realistically anyone's game. And those who played conserving their mats are rewarded with high winds chances 

That's just my take though, forcing sweat builders to play passive by making them constantly farm. What's your opinion on this?",FortNiteBR

Sure, pump-deagle exists, but it’s not as good without the building damage anymore. It’s just getting stale(guns-wise), and it doesn’t help that I’ve hated pump-smg since the beginning of season 5.

It doesn’t have to be something OP, just something that’s balanced but also something strong enough to become meta.

I would recommend pump-tac for a non-bloom playstyle, as it’s not that OP since tac is atm terrible and this would help be a refresher to pump-smg and make the tac picked up more. It would also be balanced since shotguns have very low building damage and the tac isn’t as good as laying down constant fire as smgs, so it would be for a more aim-heavy playstyle, and compared to smgs/deags, the tac has terrible range. I could go with anything to be honest tho.

1) Increased Mobility. Very fast and very high jumps with no fall damage whilst still going fast forwards is a great way to travel without wanting to attract attention through vehicles.

2) No Fall Damage. Like I said before, 1 of these things prevent fall damage. Build a sky base, get a balloon. Chilling. 

3) Easy To Find. Balloons can be found easy. Find around 1 bag of balloons in 1 out of 10 Chests. 

4) No need to carry. If you need a spot, attach one or two balloons and drop the other 8/9 to carry a fourth weapon or a healable. 

5) Easy High Ground. Someone building a tower? Balloon up and build against their build to block their shots. Release balloons once you’re on top. 

6) Easy to Remove. Crouch. Get in a build fight and Easy 180 on them with builds, then release once you really get above them. 

7) A lot goes a long way. All you really need is one, and you have 10 in a stack.

However, you all don't seem to understand that the competitive game is not played in the same way normal pubs are. Things that may not seem to have value in pubs can be incredibly strong competitively.   
The hamster balls for example mean that you cannot be damaged, and can move very quickly. This is extremely advantageous in late game competitive as it allows you to move for moving zones easily. Yes they don't have much health, but in competitive late games people cant afford to peak to laser the hamster balls for long enough, otherwise they will just be shot by someone else.  
Another example is the heavy sniper. Pros dont like the heavy sniper as it can literally one shot you with a body shot most of the time. A lot of the time you are at 150 health and hence to be one shot without the person firing even needing to get a headshot feels unfair. On top of this its wallbreaking utility makes it an incredibly powerful weapon.  
I understand that most people here enjoy the casual items for just having a laugh and thats fair enough, but it really shows why we need separate competitive and casual item pools. Pub games can have as many memey, insane things as people want, while the gauntlet can have a more balanced set of items. This could also mean pubs could be used as a testing ground for new items, and if they are found to be balanced then they can be added to gauntlet. ",FortNiteBR

The Season Shop wasn't out during all of Season 1 IIRC and came out in early November.  It is possible that the Season Shop may return solely for the Renegade Raider because of a simple change Epic made.  Epic updated the picture for the Renegade Raider as it appears in your locker.  This change is significant because this is probably done to make the skin more appealing to potential buyers.  For example when Ginger Gunner got the burnt variant her picture changed.  Her posture was different and she was looking the other way.  Scarlet Defender is also a good example.  I bought Scarlet Defender back in S4 and I remember the picture looking different than what it is now.

Epics priority with Fortnite is to sustain the player for as long as possible. That's why they do constant updates, add new items all the time and added creative, so people could make an endless number of mini games for players to enjoy, however re-adding locations would draw in the largest crowed possible. If Epic re-adds the factories for example players who stopped the game back in season 5/6 who enjoyed dropping there may return to drop there once more. This is called nostalgia baiting and if you want proof look at Pokemon which glue's the Kanto region and Generation one to everything to keep the Fans who have been here since generation one comming back. Sure it makes a lot of people angry but you can't deny the results, their latest game (Let's go, a gen one remake) was thier best selling game yet as it had that nostalgia attached to it. Like Pokemon Fortnite is waiting to use this nostalgia to thier advantage. However nostalgia only becomes more effective with time, for example re-adding Wailing woods tomorrow would do almost nothing since it hasn't been gone long enough for players to truly miss it yet. I am nearly certain that when Fortnite begins it's invitible decline and the player base begins to move onto other games, Epic will start adding old locations back to the game. They will start small with something like prison to test the response and I predict it will be really successful at rising the player count. From here they will continue to add OG locations back to the game to keep player interest. They could extend the games life cycle by at least two years by doing this.",FortNiteBR

Am I missing something? 
Is stretched really that much better for build fights?

 Although it does require some skill to use, it's honestly not that much. No weapon should be able to body shot someone with over 3/4 hp and kill them at 100+ meters, let alone 250+. The problem with the weapon is that it causes the most upsets in killing a player, ie it's the most common weapon used when a worse player kills a better player, you don't have to screw up to die but if you get one hit by a shotgun 9/10 times you screwed up your building, positioning or your own aim 

Another huge problem is that it one shots any building no matter what. With how fast the bullet travels there is almost no response time to this either. This makes the heavy sniper explosive combo unreal, especially with the rpg. It also makes a double heavy snipe combo almost impossible to defend against unless you were already turbo building. Another negative about it one shotting walls is that it makes it very easy to replace someone's walls or w key them, which to be fair could be seen as a good thing since it's very hard to do this against a good player otherwise, without explosives or exploits.

I understand the argument that it has a long reload time and is loud, but that really doesn't matter and from an above average players standpoint isn't a sound argument at all.

First off the reload speed isn't even something that affects the player using the heavy sniper because you're normally waiting for your shot at a a semi close to medium range and once you shoot you either kill them, get them one hit, or miss. At that point you won't be sniping again anyways because you'll either be safe or have to fight. If you're not somewhat close to the player then the reload speed doesn't affect you anyways because you have more than enough time to reload and shoot if they decide to push you. If the player you shot at boxes up it wouldn't matter again because most people react before you would even reload a hunting rifle  and build a box. And if you're super far away then it won't matter because you can fire pretty much unlimited shots without the person caring because the likely hood of you hitting them is super low, but if you hit them it's a kill or hugely devastating

Also the sound has basically no affect whatsoever, again with all of the situations above, they would know where you are with even a suppressed I weapon if you're taking a close range snipe, if you're pretty far away they're probably gonna box up or hide even if they didn't hear it, and even if it was as loud as an ar or shotgun they'd hear it either way. And at a super long range it doesn't even matter for the reasons previously stated (they won't care and they'd hear it even if it was the same decibel level as any other weapon)

The fact of the matter is that the heavy sniper will never be a balanced weapon in Fortnite with how it's intended to be. I understand that there is another argument that snipers are supposed to do a lot of damage but that's why we have the bolt and hunting rifle, they do insane damage too, and can one shot to the head but they CAN'T one shot to the body on someone with 150-157 health. Snipers do have their place in the game but this one doesn't. A body shot with a sniper should be rewarded with a lot of damage, not a kill. This is the skill gap of the sniper. Headshots should be an instant kill and body shots should do 1/2 health. It's just ridiculous how a weapon can literally do over 3/4 hp in a shot to your toe from 250m away.

Hopefully this post changes some of the players minds as to why the heavy sniper is op but not snipers in general.

Also, please please pleaseeeee at least put them in only supply drops (no vending machines) if you really want them in the game

TLDR, the negatives of the weapon don't really apply in most situations you use it in the strengths of it are just too good. We have the regular snipers for a reason. If epic wants them to stay at least make them supply drop only",FortNiteBR

Seriously.,"Almost all the time I play a game of fortnite, I'm in the US, and there's always somebody that is in my squad that speaks spanish.

To be honest, you and this reddit are constantly asking for crap like vaults and nerfs, and the wrong kind but you always under estimate the problem of the ever increasing annoyance of people who speak a foreign language in your squad.

Epic some how doesn't see this as a problem and thinks 100% of their community has a secondary language like spanish or that this wouldn't cause a difference at all. By the way Epic, a good part of the community isn't even old enough to take  foreign language classes or hasn't taken one. Having a screwed up squad based on language will cause chaos, make everybody mad, and will probably have the whole squad be dispersed like it's a match of solos, no one will help you neither. In a BR game, communication is very important. It's very common on European, North American, and Asian servers. In North American servers, you'll constantly find another person speaking spanish even though a majority of North America speaks English.  Fortnite is also very popular so you know this is going to be common and very annoying.

Please in the name of god, help us all and add a language based squad fill system.

Simple, just ask players when they start up the game what their language is and it will be easy.  ",FortNiteBR

Most of the time when you get sniped there's nothing you could have done to counter it, if you died to a shotgun you could have outbuild it blocked the shot and outplayed the person.

My number 1 reason of death is to snipers only because they take no skill to use, I do jumping Jack's while doing the hokeypokey and I still always get sniped they take 0 skill to use.

Let me give you a example.

If you were to build fight tfue for example he would kill you 100/100 times.

So I should clarify, I think the mechanic is fine for solo modes. However I find it very frustrating when I’ll be playing duos or squads and getting killed by a thirster, just to have my team kill them immediately afterwards. 

       I think a good fix for this would be to make the DBNO (Downed but not out) player/s invulnerable to any player damage once they’ve been knocked. The DBNO player would still take damage to the storm and fall damage, just not to other players pick/weapons. 

       This would mean in order for an enemy to get the health/shield in team modes, they would need to kill the whole team first. Thus giving you/team a chance to revive and keep teammates.

After we each looted dusty, we emoted and started engaging in a build battle. Since then, I have had many similar experiences that were only made possible by the hamster ball.

You could say that the reload time is too long, and it’s actually not that long. Sure, it’s longer than normal, but a 1 second longer reload time doesn’t justify 57 more damage, especially if that means a kill if they’re at 150.

You could say snipers are supposed to be lethal. 149 is still insanely lethal. Anyone who got hit by it would be literally one shot and wouldn’t be able to put up a fight anyways. And lethal doesn’t usually mean a kill, it just means a lot of damage, which, again, 149 is.

Body shots are easy to hit, and anyone who isn’t lucky enough to find shield to go over 150 is gonna have a bad time. If you’re half decent, you can easily body someone if they’re less than 100 meters away. The bullet just goes so fast. Anything above that does require skill, however.

I’ve had so many games where a heavy sniper gets me over 10+ kills because of how much damage it does. I almost never hit anyone and not kill them with it.

A snipe should never kill someone that has 3/4 health in a body. It’s just OP.

It looks like I was right.

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Fortnite&amp;geo=US

So it looks like late summer is when we saw our first significant drop in player interest.  Since then we've gotten Playground mode which hurt the casual player, building got buffed, which hurt the casual player, and Epic has removed or nerfed most building counters.

I think it's time we realize that Fortnite is about to enter a free fall.  Epic needs to refocus their attention on making sure the casual fanbase loves the game.  The hardcore players will stay no matter what you do (relatively speaking).",FortNiteBR

Get a fucking grip guys. This is a Online Shooter and of course the players are going to get better as the game ages. Complaining about this does nothing. If you feel you are getting nowhere in Fortnite then you need to stop playing this game. If you are playing just for “Casual Fun” then the large team based modes are for you.  I acknowledge that You guys like to goof around with new Items that seem fun but are unbalanced from a competitive standpoint and I hope that Epic makes a separate playlist so you guys can have fun with them. Its just that when you complain about a person thrashing it’s just makes you seem ignorant. This is a BR game. Just like you “casuals” like to have fun with goofy items some people like to get better at the game , drop high kill games and Ultimately to get dubs. So Please I know that it’s infuriating that when you drop into a game and you immediately get killed by a better player but stop complaining and making rants about it here and start fucking practicing to get better and ultimately get at their level.

this is a post intended in good spirit. Fortnite is one of the best games I have ever played, and the last year was made so much better by it. I have a lot of love for the developers and this community. That being said: There is no way I am going to continue to play or even spend my money on this game if it remains in its current state.

[This post by NoahJ456](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/azubqn/noahj456s_view_on_the_state_of_fortnite/) made it quite clear. You have to invest a significant amount of time regularly to be able to compete even in the slightest. Right now, I'm the best I've ever been at this game. I'm also a full time university student, I'm working two jobs, I do not have a lot of free time. And considering my circumstances, I am clearly not talented enough at the game to compensate for the fact that I am not able to play for 3 hours on a daily basis. 

I don't mind losing. I've been losing for 99 percent of the games I've played, and most of the time it was great fun. Until recently. I do mind losing to players within three minutes of entering the lobby that are absolutely, totally, completely out of my league - five times in a row. And I feel sorry for those that want to explore this beautiful game and get killed by advanced players like me. The skill gaps within the lobby are too big. 

Now, there is so much potential for this game. Some sort of ranks, some sort of skilled matchmaking would contribute greatly. Imagine having a homogenous lobby of players who are somewhat better or somewhat worse than you, but nobody being able to shred you instantaneously! I feel like that would bring back the times that used to make this game so much fun. 

Until then, I have decided to uninstall the game. I will follow the game on social media and on here. But I won't return until some sort of skillbased or ranked matchmaking is implemented in the game. 

I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Much love!",FortNiteBR

They help camp/turtle too much imo.
if you push them from high ground people spam roof wall forever, if you push them from the side u risk getting trapped.

I feel like I would have so much more fun with those 2 things removed, or maybe even just traps.

Wrong.

I get killed by a heavy sniper or any sniper for that matter like 3 times a season while I get killed by a single shotgun blast almost every goddamn game that I don’t win. 

It’s the same argument from lazy, sweaty players who focus on build first, shotgun second. A sniper shot SHOULD be devastating and you should be rewarded for making long range shots. People need to be at risk when out in the open or high up. Sniper rifles keep people honest and punish other players if you’re accurate.

It’s absolutely asinine that the same group of players who think one-pumping makes ANY sense yet lose their marbles when someone pops them for not playing tactically or being aware enough.

Let's just be honest. A shit ton of people are bad or just plain bots, myself included. Sure, I can go ahead and *try* to win, but most of the time you just grab a sh*tty AR and shotgun and just camp in a bush until the circle isn't on you, then you move to the next bush. Then the next, then the next. Eventually you are gonna get one of three options:
1: get found in a/ running to get to a bush and get built to death and emoted on
2: Last player is a pro, and they will get an easy victory royale.
2.5: it could be Tfue and let you off with a win
3: you just die of fall damage like the plebs we are.

I also know that getting wins is overrated, and kills are more important, because the more you kill/lose, the more experience you get. This is super important in the long run, and learning a new controller layout is good as well, considering you are on xbox or playstation. I am trying to practice a setup where B/O is just plain edit and Y/ triangle is switch mode, and pickaxe is right Dpad.

What i am ultimately saying before 'ranting off,' is change the wins to something else, most likely kills. 10 kills consistently every 25 games while earning actual experience to get the White Llama is sure  as hell of a lot better than just winning by bush camping.

I don't want to make this article go on forever but I am just saying that epic should really think about this and take into consideration that there were allot of new players in season 4 many of which got the Omega skin but not level 80. Back in season 4 I had an Xbox live issue for about 4 weeks and was unable play fortnite to get the max Omega. I don't think that it is fair at all that I should go for the rest of my time playing fortnite without the skin and I know allot of others will agree with me.

A short guide by a sweat,"I’ve been playing Fortnite since friendly fire was a thing, and to be honest I SUCKED. I got steamrolled by amazing players every single game. Now I’m a sweaty player myself, guilty as charged. I am, however, still a human. I still get butterflies when I know I’m close to winning, and I still die all the time to sweats like everyone else. I also die to normal players all the time, in fact, I put together this list after losing a 15 kill solo game to a below average player with 2 kills, simply because they made smart decisions and capitalized on my sweaty haste to get the win. It is 100% possible to outplay even the sweatiest of sweats, so here’s some tips for when sweatyMcTwitch lands on top of your 1x1.

1. SHOOT BACK! You need to put pressure on your opponents or they will build right up to you like frozone skating on wooden planks. Don’t hesitate to shoot down builds as soon as they go up if that means keeping the sweat in question from being able to get above you. It makes it difficult for a sweat to push you if you push back with bullets. 

2. Don’t cower! First of all never count yourself out. I don’t care how good they look like they are, don’t assume you’re screwed and hide. Sweats like to pick out less skilled players and push them for easy kills. Put pressure on them with some shots and build yourself into a safe position, or do a controlled retreat to somewhere you feel is an advantage to you. To a sweat, this is cause for concern. It’s like a bully who picks on someone until they finally fight back and scare them off. You’d be surprised how often the sweats choke because they overextend for the kill while you subtract their shields from the equation with an ar or sniper. In general, sweats can’t tell if you’re a god or a bot at first, so put some serious pressure on them and they might think they’re outmatched. If they really are just a better player and they kill you, at least you put up your best performance and tried instead of letting them walk all over you. In that case accept that they were simply the better player and don’t be hard on yourself for not being able to win. 

3. Move! Don’t get surrounded because you’re afraid of moving and potentially losing. Look where the zone is and get to an advantageous position. This makes it much, much harder for a sweat to push you. Use your launchpads! Repositioning is the best way to get easy shots on opponents and to minimize how many players can see you at once. 

4.  If they get you low, turtle up and heal. You might feel like you’re letting the sweat walk all over you, and to be fair you are, but keeping your health full is your top priority. If they try to take your walls, get ready to turbo build, but also consider that the sweat has to drop down to do this. If they don’t block your roof, get above them by editing your way out of the top. If they are on top of you trying to break in, place a trap to stop them. Don’t be afraid to edit out of the side and make another box, as this makes it harder to find you. In general turtling slows down your opponent and often frustrates them, often giving a third party time to arrive and you a clean getaway in the ensuing chaos 

5. Defend yourself at all times. Never go for a 50-50, which is two players hailing shotgun shots at each other from 3 feet away while jumping around like a frog. Always block shots with walls when possible. Nothing spells an easy kill for a sweat like a player who shoots but doesn’t build in a fight. You don’t have to be a building god for this to work either. Even if you land a 199 headshot on your first shot, you can’t just w key right up to them and expect them not to shoot you back. Place a wall to block their shotgun shots and maybe a stair over their head, and consider that if you can see them, chances are they can see you. 

6. Get good at using traps! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve overextended on an easy kill and gotten trapped because of it. My favorite way to do this is to build a floor-wall-stair combo right on top of them and then place two traps. Traps are literally your best friend when fighting sweats, especially when they try to w key into your builds. Just place one or two down and a stair on top of them and you’re safe.

Some might call me a bot, because I haven’t figured out the mechanics of building an Eiffel Tower yet, but sure as shit I know how to aim and I know strategy and rotation. I also know not to landed Tilted during pop-ups.

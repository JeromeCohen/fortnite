This is a huge disadvantage.,"The issue is on PS4 and Xbox using default controllers. I use PS4 mostly so I'll use the PS4 buttons to explain the issue. So on PS4 you hit X to jump, and only then can you move your thumb from the X button to the right stick to control your aim. 

That's a huge problem and many many players don't even realize it. It's why you can't jump and avoid being shot while shooting. It's why people come flying off a ramp and shotgun you in the face and you think they're just super good players. They aren't necessarily. What they are able to do though is both jump and aim/move their camera at the exact same time.

It's possible to do this on the default controllers by going and setting your controls to custom and rebinding your jump button to the left stick press. It will take a little while to get used to, but you'll now be able to jump and aim at the same time.

I guess I'm just posting this so people realize it's a huge problem/disadvantage, that there is a way to somewhat fix it while still using a normal controller, and it would be better if you could use BOTH X and the left stick press to jump. Currently that's not possible.",FortNiteBR

When will they understand this?,"First and foremost I want to say this is by far the least enjoyable meta and loot pool that‚Äôs ever been in Fortnite since I started playing in season 2/3. Every gun is a spammy instant health deleting piece of garbage. Crossbow, tactical AR, Drum Gun, Combat, etc. Every time I get in a fight my health bar gets deleted instantly and there is so much mobility there are no long distance fights anymore...if you shoot someone from 100m away they are in your base within 5 seconds. It‚Äôs such garbage.

Secondly, Epic thinks these spammy easy to use overpowered weapons cater to casual players...but they are so damn wrong. I played for at least 4-5 hours last night and all I ran into were tryhards. Every damn lobby was a team of sweats with drum guns, combat shottys, and crossbows. What don‚Äôt they get about that????

The most fun I had in a long time was classic mode. Me and my squad had around 10 wins in one night because the loot pool was so simple. Most played had a regular AR, TAC/PUMP, SMG, BOLT. None of those weapons are OP, most fights were strategic and lasted long and the only mobility were launch pads. I actually enjoyed the fights I was in. If I got shot I still had health and I had time to heal. This is the first time I truly am not enjoying Fortnite...please Epic look at what your doing. The game is a hot mess right now between the awful loot pool, overpowered weapons and insane amounts of mobility.",FortNiteBR

Especially if you get in a battle and leave with health enough to get one shot by a burst smg from 50 meters away. Maybe they‚Äôre right about the current version of siphon promoting way to aggressive play but we need some sort of health per kill. Well I have an idea..it may or may not need some tweaking and if you think so feel free to reply with your thoughts. My idea is that the last shot we fire into an enemy that finally kills them (limited to 50 health) we should get the health that they had left before we fired that final shot. Ex: You get an enemy down to 20 health and he tries hide so you can heal but you drop down and finish him off with a shot to the head with a combat shotgun, but you were at 60 health because of a shot he hit you with earlier. Well with this you get the 20 health that he had before you finished him and now you‚Äôre at 80 health (remember this is limited to a maximum of 50 health.

I personally have enjoyed the change to the combat shotgun and had no issues with the pump removal...until you nerfed the drop rate into the ground. I played five games in a row the other night where I landed at Paradise and found either a semi snipe, pistol, or burst smg. I consider it lucky if I land on a house and can even find a grey tac shotgun these days. It is extremely difficult to make it out of spawn with these weapons and I'm a good player. As soon as you run into the lucky person who pulled a combat it's GG.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing this game since day 1 and I've never been this frustrated by the loot pool. The other night when I pulled those terrible guns 5 games in a row I got so mad I just turned my xbox off. Is that really the kind of gaming experience you want for your population?  Where they waste an hour of their day dropping into games and can't even find a viable weapon? I really hope it's not.

I do really enjoy the item but to me the fun of getting and using it every once and a while is not really worth getting hit by a boom bow very often. Sometimes the enemy will have 2 or more people with boom bows just eliminating you all the time. It's like your just walking \*quick arrow piercing air sound\* then \*small explosion\* then your dead. It happens over and over. These types of matches aren't super often but when you do get into one and seeing how long a team rumble match is after the kill goal increase from 100 to 150, it is a very annoying for how ever many minutes the match lasts. I am just saying it should be vaulted in team rumble because I don't really have a problem at all with the boom bow in normal matches, just team rumble. This is my opinion so you can talk with people and discuss in the comments but don't take it the wrong way.",FortNiteBR

I don‚Äôt even go for headshots anymore because I know that 70% of the time I‚Äôll be able to one shot them to the body. 

150 is probably the most common amount of health someone would have and to be shot at out of now where with no chance at fighting back is a bit too much IMO. You get shot at by an AR you can build and fight back. Shotgun? Build and fight back. You should be able to one shot with a sniper if it‚Äôs a headshot however because that does take some amount of skill. Body shots should NOT be a one shot at the most common health and shield level though. It should be lowered to 140/147 from 150/157. It‚Äôll still be the most powerful sniper but leave room for the opponent to fight back. There is literally no reason you would pick up a Silenced Sniper or an Semi-auto Sniper over a Heavy. A silencer means absolutely nothing in this game.

I‚Äôll also remind you guys that there‚Äôs 5 snipers on the game. Why exactly is there 5 snipers in the game? They all have the strengths yes but most players would still pick up the Heavy if they decided to carry a sniper.

It has a good utility that is breaking walls instantly and going into someone 1x1 which that as well adds to how broken it is.

Nerf it to 140/147 but don‚Äôt vault it.",FortNiteBR

So salty and negative all the time... I miss positive streamers that congratulate their enemies for killing them and saying things like ""nice shot!""

Ninja USED to do that... He doesn't anymore.

Streamers just seem to think everyone else is below them it's crazy.

Streamer A could die to Streamer B, both pro players, but they don't know who killed them, and they'd STILL say the guy that killed them was trash.

TL;DR: it's kinda broken in early game due to lack of hp and rewards too much RNG (in a unacceptable way), so unlucky people who don't have shields (have 100 life) die and it's over, reduce the splash damage to 99, make it Airdrop only, reduce the projectile speed and increase the ""bullet drop""

I don't think the Boom Bow is op now in normal circumstances, it can only deal 100 damage, so in mid game situations where you have the heals and mats to build cover and heal the damage caused by the Boom Bow easily with some inteligence... **BUT,** there's situations where you can't do anything and in a matter of seconds you are dead. These situations are:

1. Early game

+ Remember when you could get a RPG from chests and you start a killing spree because nobody was expecting a RPG or had shields or had mats? Almost the same situation. I played a match once and i landed in the Montain close to Salty Springs and i got a Boom Bow there and i thought with myself ""how much people i will kill just standing here shooting people in Salty?"" The answer came like 1 minute and a half: i killed 6 dudes, none of them had 100 or less hp and they didn't expected the shots, i cannot lie, that shit was ridiculously funny and totally broken.

2. Low HP/no shields (shitty RNG)

+ It's Fortnite, more than that is a BR RNG based, why is this a problem just with the Boom Bow? Because the way that this gun works, the only way to counter this weapon is: have more than 100 life and have heals in your inventory, because this weapon is extremely easy to use, what isn't the problem simply because it hit for 100 only and in normal circumstances like i said, you would resist and not die, but when you aren't in the normal circumstances like you didn't found shields and the circle isn't in the Desert, Dusty Divot or close to Haunted Hills to get ""ground consumables""? You just need to be unlucky enough to a dude with a Boom Bow look at you and you are dead.

So, to avoid this, i suggest three little changes that would give a bit of chances for these poor guys:

# Reduce the splash damage to 99 (or 90) when fully charged and 74 when isn't fully charged

+ You may think: ""yo this guy is tripping balls, he think 1 (or 10) less damage would fix this broken ass gun, what a dumb dumb"". If you see the drop rates of medkits, bandages and the overall most common amount of health that your enemies have, you will see that almost nobody have less than 100 health, is 99% of the cases: 100 (100/0 or 75/25), 125 (75/50 or 100/25), 150 and 200, there's like a tiny percentage of players who are unlucky enough to have less than 100 life in mid game and this dude is probably freaking out looking for heals, so got hitted by a Boom Bow? You will mostly likely have 1 (or 10) hp left.

# Make it Airdrop only like the RPG

+ To avoid one hitting people and sending them to the lobby in the moment that people normally don't have mats to cover themselves and heal after a Boom Bow hit or die in a Third Party for a dude with the Boom Bow, people would get it only with some effort and in a, i would say, proper moment for a Boom Bow in a Airdrop (+ increase the respawn rate of the airdrops)

# increase the ""bullet drop"" and reduce the projectile speed

+ It's a FUCKEN Bow, why it have almost the same projectile speed of a Sniper and almost the same bullet drop, reducing it would make people compensate their shots requiring more prediction

# (this one is weird, but i think it's a good and deserved change) make it a Mythical Weapon to occupy two slots instead of one.

+ Imagine this situation: you got hitted by a Boom Bow but you was in a ""normal circumstance"", but the enemy is ~~a asshole~~ running a Boom Bow and Stinky Granades to throw all of the 6/3 at the first dude that he hit a Boom Bow shot, and this happen to you, it's almost impossible survive to this, so making it need two slots, would make the Boom Bow a weapon that require sacrifice to use. (It's weird, idk in my opinion looks like a good change)

**I don't think straight up throwing it in the vault is good, throwing stuff in the vault instead of fixing them is taking off part of the variety of the game and this gun got potential to be good and balanced at the same time, and it's one of the few weapons if this game that give a really feeling of power**",FortNiteBR

My test had me die 15 times and see who won &amp; if they were m/k or controller  (I am on Xbox btw)

But how can you tell its M/K?

If you watch they switch from slot 1 to slot 3 or 4, Controller only moves one at a time (1&gt;2&gt;3), not a skip (1&gt;3).

And I did ask each person, just to be sure (Through their epic games account or Xbox account if they had one)

|Match Number|Kills|M&amp;K?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Match 1|**10**|**Yes**|
|Match 2|**11**|**Yes**|
|Match 3|3|No|
|Match 4|9|No|
|Match 5|**15**|**Yes**|
|Match 6|12|No|
|Match 7|**13**|**Yes**|
|Match 8|2|No|
|Match 9|**23**|**Yes**|
|Match 10|**11**|**Yes**|
|Match 11|3|No|
|Match 12|**10**|**Yes**|
|Match 13|**12**|**Yes**|
|Match 14|**14**|**Yes**|
|Match 15|**6**|**Yes**|

&amp;#x200B;

10/15 Were M/K with AT LEAST 6+ kills (One guy pulled **23**)

5/10 Were Controller players all who barely managed to pull one double digit kill number (**12**)

This data shows CONSISTENT use of M&amp;K against Controller. Playing on controller is hard enough, then people can just use M/K instead, but reap the benefits of console's more bot status players. And it's so easy to do, you just ready up on controller and wait, once in the game just yeet the controller, don't need that anymore, just press any key and your good. I think there should be something in place to protect from this. Have it just say INPUT BLOCKED when you try to use it. OR whatever you ready up with, then you play on that. 

Sorry about the rant, but you should hopefully, understand my frustration with this.",FortNiteBR

I complain about games because I love them, I want to have fun, I want to win but I have to leave this game if I actually want to like it a few months, or years from now.

Fortnite is a BR builder style game and when I first played it, I loved it. I guess it was more fun learning to build along with others but now its just me turtling and hoping I don't get edited and die instantly from Tfue and Ninja wannabes. 

I have nothing against being a tryhard. If you wanna be the best at something then go ahead, take that shit and be the best, but when you ruin other peoples fun for that sake, that's what I don't like. Purposely editing in someone face, showing off before you kill them or trap boxing them to impress a few viewers on your stream who wouldn't even remember you once the next BIG streaming comes along is a tad bit annoying.

The decision to mesh the playerbase together, PS4 and Xbox, and mobile and switch was by far the stupidest decision. Adding in gliders then taking them out, removing the pump. Even the siphon ability in game modes. There are more sweats and TTV playing on PS4 than any console (desktop included.) But because both the playerbases were shrinking and I mean slightly, they force us together. I purposely play in small lobbies to eliminate the high amount of sweats I play against.

I have nothing against the LTMs, except the sponsorship LTMs, they are always rushed and unbalanced and it sucks. 

The overall gameplay is great, but the community it so very toxic.

I can guarantee you someone with insult me over my opinion and that is how toxic this community is. Everyone just wants this game to be the bane of games, the best thing since sliced bread but it isnt. 

One of the most annoying things in this game is fall damage, I'm not sure what other BR games have this feature but it is totally unnecessary. As is jump fatigue, and the inability to choose your FOV to suit your needs. This game is just an excuse generator that is just neverending. 

The arena mode is laughable, the level up system is also a joke. Camping does exist, you shouldn't give people points for being lazy, or if they are new or bad at the game camping to reach top five. You should only receive points for kills and placing top 3, that's what competition really is. 

This is a childs game, not a bet a million on it only to die to fall damage that varies based on how much health you have or die because their servers are too shit to have 40 players in the second to last circle, that's an issue they still haven't truly fixed. 

This game isn't perfect but I love it anyway which is why I am quitting because I have hope that in a year from now (if it isn't dead by then) when I play it again some issues are fixed and I will still like it when I played during season 3.",FortNiteBR

I don‚Äôt ever really take the arguments seriously because usually noone ends up trying to understand the perspective of the other person. 

I had this situation where I get sniped in the back while we were both facing the same direction. I say behind you as soon as I got knocked without knowing exactly where the shot came from. I expected him to get shot in the back immediately. 

Heres the clip of the situation: 
https://twitter.com/throwawayburna/status/1132541295837294592?s=21

He‚Äôs upset that I said behind him without knowing where the shot came from, even though I knew it came from behind us somewhere. He believes I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything at all. 

Here‚Äôs his argument:

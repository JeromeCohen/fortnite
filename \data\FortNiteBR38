Seriously what in the world is wrong with you people? This is a sub for people to talk about the things going on in the game and share their experiences as well as get news out there for other people to know what’s going on. We are in the middle of a huge event but all I see when I scroll through the feed is kids asking for stuff in game like “Can we get the LMG and Homing Launcher instead of the grappler?” Or “Here’s my idea for how to bring siphon back into the game.” Asking for in game content is against the rules of this sub and I’m confused as to why these posts are allowed. I have never seen a more entitled, whiny, bratty group of people than this sub. Epic should have never listened to this sub in the first place. It’s gotten out of hand and I’m so glad they have basically stopped listening. This sub definitely should not have any influence on the game after seeing its community. Thanks for your time and I don’t care about karma because it means nothing so downvote me to hell if it makes you feel better about yourself.

Like, look at the STW Sub, they are civil, and yeah, STW has its problems, but the community doesn’t complain for the most part. The FNBR community is the same as the children who played minecraft at its peak, but look at minecraft now, it’s got one of the best communities out there. They respect the developers and their decisions, they give thought-out, impactful, valuable feedback, but all FNBR community does is, “this is OP”, or, “this is useless”. Like, the devs try.

Here in Brazil theres not many players and because of that I cannot disable this option, otherwise I won’t find ANY match. 

The disclaimer that shows the message appear only one time and most of the people click enable because they did not want to read or did not even notice the message. So, basically, EVERYBODY in Brazil (at least PS4) enable it, and I doubt even 10% knew they did. Some people said that they did not even understood the message.

Why I am obligated to play against PC players now?! It is so frustrating. I do not have money to buy scuff controllers (that does not even sell in Brazil) or a super PC to be able to compete in NORMAL MODES against these players.

I do not want to be a professional player, I just want to have fun. Let the cross-play feature enabled for competitive modes or let it how it used to be: ONLY enable when you are playing with someone IN OTHER PLATFORM.

Please Epic, just make it how it used to be! I am playing with friends in console, I don’t want to play against PC players. Nobody in my party have a PC. Thats really UNFAIR.",FortNiteBR

With all the bugs that come with turbo building, I always wonder how the game would play if we removed this element from the game like it used (I believe turbo building was introduced in season 2? I started playing then and I remember when it was added). I think this could be a cool mode for casuals that don't like how crazy the building is currently. It could also drastically change the mid / late game. Right now in competitive, there's like 40 people in the moving circles, nobody fights during the middle part of the game. If turbo building was removed, I believe mid game would become a lot more entertaining with less turtling. Could make for a more entertaining viewer experience as well. 

This is an LTM I would like to see, as I do not want epic to just make changes like this without trying it first. Here's a list of pros and cons for this:

Pros: 
-gives casual players a better experience as they try to learn how to play, will have less complicated building going on around them. 
-Prevent turtling
-more action mid game
-less crowded late game w/ moving circles
-makes ping not as important (if you have good ping, you can take other people's wall while they turtle)
-i remember some players argued that turbo building lowered skill ceiling, I don't agree or disagree, but some players think it's a part of building.

Cons:
-drastic change to meta
-harder to win battles when outnumbered
-removes some building techniques that have been common practice since turbo building was put in
-makes spray weapons easier to hit damage through people's building
-quality of life change (not having to spam mouse 1 while building is nice)

If you guys can add to the pros and cons that would be great. Anyway, just think it would be a cool LTM that might make the game feel more similar to how it was when people weren't as good. (for those of you that say I want this because I'm a casual, I would disagree. I don't necessarily want this change in the game, just think it would be cool to see, and maybe it would be better for the game)",FortNiteBR

They have virtually the same damage, the bow reloads much faster, the bow is explosive but the sniper is not, the bow has much faster travel time (almost hitscan below 100m) and the bow has no directional audio and is more silenced than a *silenced* sniper.
Here are some changes to balance the bow so it doesn’t have too much burst, spam and ease to use:
- Change ammo to rockets or make it not explode.
- Reduce projectile speed to the same or slower than a sniper.
- Give splash damage falloff (the further from the player the explosion hits, the less the damage to encourage real aim and not mindless spam).
- Increase sound and enhance the directional audio.
- Make it a no headshot flat damage weapon at 100 damage per shot.
- Increase reload speed and increase draw time.

I ve been playing Fortnite for a long time. And I have decent aim besides when it comes to shotguns. I think I used to be better but I honestly rarely hit over a 100 the past months and I do always try to aim for the head.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my shotgun technique:

I usually try to aim at the enemie's head and then also press l2 right before I shoot to trigger the aim assist but I guess I am always off target.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

Is there aim assist for shotguns?

Is the shotgun hitscan or bullet travel?

Is my technique correct? Or should  I maybe hipfire more?

Is the bullet spread higher on hip fire or the same?

Could there be a problem with aim assist in low distant fights if I have a fast moving enemy so I should not resort to it? 

Sometime I tell myself  I miss because my enemy is lagging, but it happens too often...

They give us wraps, reactive skins with selectable styles and pickaxes (even emotes), gliders, lobby music, etc. If you haven't played this season that much, that's because you're burnt out, not because the season is bad, that's such a dumb excuse.

And we know that siphon settings are still available in arena mode, but arena mode is for serious competitive players casual players don't want to play arena mode, and we living in SEA never get Singapore server in arena mode, we always get Tokyo server with 150 ping in arena mode.

So my suggestion is,
Add siphon back, and add a PASSIVE rank based matchmaking(we really don't mind waiting for an extra 10-20 secs for matchmaking), and if possible add bots to lower ranked matches so the newbies won't have to struggle,
 At least it's better than dying to a 3rd party unskilled player when you're low on hp because of the previous fight. Which is current scenario.

People hunting rifle killing you from point blank range, going through every single edit in the span of two seconds, building the Seattle sky needle just for one kill etc. 

Disco domination or some type of respawn ltm for solo would be awesome. I stopped playing for the past week because of how it’s borderline impossible to get a win unless you play passively. I would absolutely love for rank play to be a thing but at least filtering out the sweats for people who want a casual experience would greatly benefit a lot of people. It would also give those who play by themselves an opportunity to get better. I can’t tell you how many times I see people on this sub asking for a training partner because they get destroyed in solo but don’t have anymore to play duo/squads with. 

So epic I urge you not to neglect the solo games. It’s been god awful since the season has started and I’m at a point where I’ll only play squads with my cousins, won’t bother playing the game otherwise. I’m just tired of having to sit 2 inches from my screen and my hand being drenched in sweat after every match just to get one or two kills. I used to be able to drop 7-9 fairy easy, now I can’t drop more than 5 and I’m putting in WAY more work than I used to. Almost 12000 games under my belt and I’ve finally accepted that you can’t really get good at an ever-changing game so I don’t want to be good, I just want to have fun. 

I’m not even sure if we had any solo LTMs this season other than Solid Gold for like 5 minutes. An LTM like catch would be so much fun if I was able to play it solo. 

Some of us don’t have people to play with on a regular basis and some of us simply don’t like playing with others. This season especially, epic has been force feeding us squad and duo LTMs. 

The thing that most upset me was the new Endgame LTM. The original Thanos LTM was my favorite LTM of all time. Endgame probably barely makes my top 10 now for the sole reason of it being a team based fight. The Royal Rumble-esque fighting with respawn is nice but I would like a respawn gamemode that is for solo games only, at least. 

Bring back solid gold, fly explosives, catch, close encounters, etc. All in the form of a solo game mode. At least come up with something unique and make it only a solo mode like epic does with these squad modes. 

Seriously, the solo player is being neglected like crazy this season.",FortNiteBR

There needs to be an in-game voting poll. Starting as soon as the game updates, voting on the major update coming in the following week(s) that change the game drastically. 5 questions, then change the game accordingly. It’s actually mind baffling they haven’t done this by now. It reassures me that Epic Games doesn’t care about the players.  There shouldn’t be any surprises to the community whose supported this game through its ridiculous updates in the past.  Lay it out on the table Epic Games. 

It doesn’t need to be complicated. Close ended questions.

1. The drum gun will not increase the spray meta, as another SMG (most likely the suppressed) will be vaulted. For example, this happened when Epic introduced the suppressed sniper, but vaulted the bolt. 

2. Despite what people say, the drum gun is statistically balanced. Compared to the suppressed SMG, It does slightly more damage, has more ammo, and better range, but it shoots slower, does less structure damage, and isn’t suppressed.

3. It’s fun and easy to use. It’s simple to get the hang of, and is great to use no matter what skill level you are. It’s accurate, and can be used effectively with a pump, but not overpowered as previously mentioned. 

4. It’s better than the other choices.
- The bouncers are only used effectively by good players, giving them an advantage against players who don’t really know what they’re doing.
- The tactical SMG is too overpowered in close situations and I don’t think Epic would have an option to vault any weapon in exchange.
-The grappler doesn’t have enough ammo to be worthy of being unvaulted. 
-The planes....... self explanatory.
- The infinity blade should stay in an LTM, not in the regular game.

The competition would be more equal because, especially in Fortnite, when playing against other European players, ping plays a major role on building and editing, meaning that if someone with lower ping fights you, he can just overtake your wall very easily and shoot you faster than you do. 

It would be fine not to make such server if it is dedicated to a couple thousand population area, but Balkan Peninsula is an area with approximately 60 million population.

Summing up, I think I made it clear that such change would help people on the Eastern Europe A LOT and as a result, new players might pop off to the scene and prove their skills.

I have the S10+ and I am trying to claim the iKONIK skin through the store but I keep getting met with the error ""Server error occured.

I am able to see the skin bundle in the shop but I am unable to do anything past the point at which I am meant to enter my card details.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking online on the official [iKONIK samsung promotion website](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/fortnite/) at the very bottom it gives instructions on how to claim it and step 3 states ""  Go to the Store.  The iKONIK outfit should appear in the Store. Tap on  it.  Make sure your store is set to Samsung in Settings &gt; Account. "". Howver, I do not see the option to change the store (Others have this option and I do not) which is preventing me from claiming the skin.

I see a lot of similar issues with people online and no one seems to have a solution so I was wondering if anyone could help me out since I am really disappointed since I spent a lot of money of this phone.

Say, for instance, Ninja wanted the drum gun back ( unlikely ), the drum gun would be quick to resurface. My point behind this is to let the community choose this, not a hand full of people with larger voices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nerfs:** 

* After the use of the Infinity Slam you will now have to wait 7 seconds before you can use the slam again.
* The Infinity Swing now requires 2 hits to any structure to destroy it
* The Infinity Blade now takes 15 seconds to pick up

1. We felt people we're ONLY going for the Infinity Blade when landing Polar Peak, so we've decided to change the pick up animation time to be 15 seconds instead of it's old 5.12 seconds to encourage players to play smarter and land to get a weapon before wielding the power of the Blade without the safety of being alone. (*Demo of the new animation:*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKrWc3NeGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQKrWc3NeGw))

* You can now only use the Infinity Slam through 5 structures at a time from it's previous infinite amount, this change includes player built structures
* Movement speed decreased from 130% to 125%

**Buffs:**

* Removed the extra Infinity Slam animation
* The Infinity Swing now takes 0.16 seconds to swing, from it's previous .25 seconds
* You can now build whilst carrying the Infinity Blade but will be limited to 250 materiel for each materiel type
* Changed overall HP from 400 to 600 | *300 health &amp; 300 shield*

1. We felt players who had the Infinity Blade had to run from anyone with a gun, especially apparent in Duos and Squads, and we're getting their health drained way too quickly.

* When wielding the Infinity Blade, if you are low on health you will gain 5 health and shield per second

**Changes including players:**

* When the Infinity Blade is dropped it will not longer act as an item, it will drop and stick into the ground. Players will then have to do a 5 second animation to wield it again.
* The damage of the Infinity Blade has been switched, when Swinging at a player it will do 25 damage, and if you Slam a player it will now do 90 damage.
* The first player to wield the Infinity Blade will be granted 600 health immediately
* Players who do not pick up the blade first from the pedestal will be granted 250 HP and will gain 5 health and shield per second 

**Changes not including players:**

*  On the killfeed, It will now come up as (Player name) erased (Victim’s name) with the *Infinity Blade*

2) If you spawn in the game and you’re not an avenger, don’t be a little pansy child and quit because you don’t want to be a Chitauri. You’re ruining the game by doing so. grow up.

It's also well-known that you are able to switch to a build type to grab an edit that you can't see, such as the case when you switch to your wall piece to edit a wall that you can't see because of a ramp blocking your view.

If there was a setting that allowed resets of edits by attempting to place the same build of an existing edited build that I already own, then both of the above problems could be better solved for both kb&amp;m and controller players

For example, lets take a scenario:

I'm getting spammed with a p90 from above in my box while I have a floor above my head which has 3 squares edited open.

* With the old system: I will pull out my floor piece and start turbo building, and then I will realize I have a floor edited above me which is why it is not building, so I attempt to reset the floor, and I'm most likely dead by this point.
* With the proposed system: I will pull out my floor piece and start turbo building, and my existing floor will be automatically reset to a normal floor (or whatever my preedited floor is set to), and I will probably live.

I think this would benefit controller players the most, as it gives a much more feasible way to reset edits quickly, and lowers the gap that scroll-wheel resets have added. This also helps you to avoid those deaths where you can't see high enough to see that your floor is edited above you and needs to be reset (rip fov).

&amp;#x200B;

This wouldn't take away scroll wheel to reset from kbm players, but just gives controllers and kmb a similar alternative that may be more useful.",FortNiteBR

I have tried changing channels, restarting everything, setting up the priority networking that comes with the R8000. Nothing has worked yet or really made it better.

If you aren't, that poll is found [here](https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1112071234710323202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1112071234710323202&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Ffortnite%2Fover-100-000-fortnite-fans-vote-state-controversial-update-ninja-poll-502865). 

Those results indicated that 87% of players want siphon. Epic's claim is that 90% of players played less because of siphon being added to core modes. That's a nearly mirror image in results. There's no way one of these two isn't absolutely horribly wrong.

We are also disregarding the facts that Epic's test took place when Apex was still popular and when lack of a ranked playlist was forcing literal pro players to play against casuals, thus influencing the amount of people playing Fortnite during that time period.

Now, the first argument against this is always ""324,000 people is no where near Fortnite's total population so there are literal millions of uncounted voices"". 

**Rebuttal:** Not true. No research involving statistics ever samples an entire population to find statistically valid results. What about half? Lower. A quarter? Still way too high. 10%? Still way, way too high. 

Actually, you only need a sample size of [.0384%](http://iqsresearch.com/what-makes-a-statistically-valid-sample/) (yes, that's with removing the two decimal places to account for percentages) of a population if done correctly. 

Now, obviously Ninja took absolutely no measures to ensure he conducted a study with a valid sample. There is obviously bias one way or the other. For argument's sake (ignoring the fact that Ninja's audience is primarily casual and would if anything support Epic's claim if it wasn't a lie), let's assume it's biased **for** siphon. 

Let's also assume Fortnite's population during Epic's supposed testing period was 100 million people playing during those three weeks (probably too high at this point, but I'm being generous). 

Quoting the source, which is responsible for conducting statistical studies for major companies like Ford and Brown-Foreman:

&gt;What’s fascinating is if we wanted to widen our population count to, say 100 million people, you might think we have to ask 38,400 people. Not so. If you wanted to find out how many people out of 100 million would vote for vanilla, you only need to survey 385 people. It is still a statistically valid sample with just 385 people, and still able to gauge the ice cream preferences of one-third of the United States.

This means that, even despite the fact that Ninja didn't conduct a ""correct"" random sample, and even assuming Ninja's results are skewed in favor of siphon due to various factors and biases, Ninja sampled over **843 times**  the amount of people he would have had to if he had done a correct random sample (324,806/385).

I think a population sample size of 843 times the required amount is more than enough to account for any biases. Given that information, it would be plausible if Epic's results differed by even 50%. But their results are an almost exact mirror image of Ninja's. A company who would have every reason to promote their new playlist that directly ties into the biggest marketing event in the company's history in the form of the World Cup, by taking a feature they know people love and making it exclusive to that playlist. 

**So I ask you Epic, why are you lying?**",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

\-villain team have a max health/shield total of 240. heros have 300.

&amp;#x200B;

\-the weapons given to the villains are a joke at best, and incredibly bland. a slow firing burst rifle and a aoe gun that doesn't appear to do any damage to heroes other than 100 points to their shield from what I can tell (heroes have 300 total health, and I 1v1'd a guy and pulled 3 100's. this is the basis for my point. whether there is another factor im missing, idk.)

\- the heroes weapons have far leap attacks, full attack deflection, and auto aim. captains shield and iron mans repulsors both have auto aim and require no skill to use.

&amp;#x200B;

\-only one person gets to be thanos from what ive experienced. it doesn't change each time he dies.

&amp;#x200B;

\- the villain team has limited lives from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

in conclusion, the heroes all get the equivalent of  infinity swords and infinite lives until all the stones are collected, and the villains get equivalent of grey infantry rifles and shield only grenade launchers and limited lives until they grab all the stones, if they even can.

&amp;#x200B;

this makes the gameplay for the villain incredibly unenjoyable to play. its obvious im not the only one who feels this way given the fact that each time I end up on the villain team, all of my teammates disconnect within the first 3 minutes, along with over half of the rest of my team (my last match ended with only 8 people on my team and 19 on the hero team). id buff the villains health and nerf the heroes health, give a cooldown to ironmans repulsors and reduce its range, and make captains shield only able to defend what directly hits the shield. then maybe this game mode might be enjoyable. as it stands, trying to do the challenges for this game mode, especially grabbing 3 stones, really sucks.",FortNiteBR

So many console players have quit because the game they loved no longer exists.  The difference between season 2 Fortnite and what goes on now is far more than just a gradual evolution.  

Epic toys around a lot with changes like material maximum and getting health for kills, all with the goal in mind of having the perfect balance of leveling the playing field with not alienating the hardcore players.  But nothing would be more successful at this than a mode where console players had to use Oldschool control scheme.  There would still be room for mechanical talent to shine and give advantage, but not to the ridiculous degree there is now, and emphasis would shift towards gunfights a bit more.

You are ruining the game, not epic in this case

Saying FOV slider is a good thing because everyone can do it, meaning everyone would have to instead play the game while it looks like ass just to get an advantage. Maybe there is some in between here, but I think the outrage is a bit excessive here as well

We get it. You are overly competitive and want to win at all costs. Including making the game worse for the majority. And that is what the majority of this whiny ass sub has become. I’m glad Epic is barely listening too us now.

And yes Epic has made mistakes and some of the bugs this week were pretty bad. Hope they fix those and hope arena gets better. Ballers need to be nerfed more or removed.

But use your brain people. So many people in denial and trying to find any reason they can in this echo chamber of a sub.",FortNiteBR

Epic blatantly said that they don’t want people to have a competitive advantage, right? So why do we have different sensitivities for editing, building, and shooting, and, why do we have builder pro and combat pro?

I can easily make the argument that building and editing sensitivities gives certain people an advantage, hell way moreso than a resolution change. Surely if epic can see the advantage in having resolution changes then they certainly can see the advantage in people having higher sensitivities. The game can’t be considered fair when you have certain people ‘moving faster’ than others. 

Y’all want the game to be fair? Make it consistent all around. Get rid of RNG too, make floor loot spawns 100% and chest spawns 100%, etc. It’ll never happen but you can’t truly say that this game is fair when there’s RNG and certain setting give people advantages. You know what? While we’re at it, let’s make lobbies completely determined on ping. It’s not fair for players with 20 ping to fight a player with 2 ping, they’re automatically 10 times slower than the competition and thus are at a disadvantage. 

Oh, and let’s not forget about competitive console players being stuck in matches with PC players. How is it fair for a controller user to keep up with KB+M?

Hell, remove shield or let everyone spawn with 200, therefore no one person has a health advantage in a gun fight. 

Before you downvote me, understand that this post is satire with valid points thrown in. If Epic really wants the game to be ‘fair’ then they should focus on everything I laid out. I’d hardly consider the game ‘fair’ now anyways. Epic is preventing it from becoming more ‘unfair’ but that doesn’t mean they should neglect the aspects of the game that could very well be considered unfair to begin with.",FortNiteBR

Never ever in my fucking life in any game I have ever played has this happend. How can you hate on the better player? From the games I came from (ehem CS) players in higher ranks were looked up upon, and when they discovered a problem with the game the community ralied up alongside them and brought the problem to the developers. In Fortnite, if a pro player discovers a bug or rants about the state of the game (which is horrible) the community will call them whiny. ""Its a free game"", so what? It still deserves to be properly functioning and in a state that makes the majority happy. You are honestly telling me Siphon wasn't liked by everyone? It gave everyone a fair chance. If you played more passive and landed cold, you would still be shieled up to be able to fight the aggresive player that fought all game, and vice versa. 

Don't get me started on the Soccer Skin hate. Ever since that imbecile LazarBeam started hating on Soccer Skins and ttv's everyone is doing the same. Look on comment threads for example.

However colorblindness only affects up to 8% of men and 0.5% of women.

Fortnite also has visual audio to accommodate deaf players. Again, this is great that Epic has gone to such great lengths to include these accessibility settings.

Deaf people only make up 0.22% of the US population.

In contrast to that...

Up to 10% of people are SEVERELY affected by motion sickness. And up to 75% are affected to some extent.

Telling 10% of the population that Fortnite will not accommodate them is outrageous. 

Seriously. Players that suffer from motion sickness need to be heard and given accessibility options so they too can enjoy the game without suffering from headaches and/or nausea.

This is a no brainer.",FortNiteBR

Opinions?,"I havent played in the last 3 months because I have been travelling, but I still am on this sub all the time. The game actually is starting to look unplayable and unenjoyable (render issues, bugs everywhere, farming rate, etc. ). I really am hoping to start playing when I get back next week, but it honestly looks like it dies more and more every day.

Fortnite has been among the top games I have played in my life, and its truly sad that its going down like this. It seems like they are just trying to do too much content without focusing on making the sure the game actually plays well and is enjoyable. 

What do you guys think? Is Fortnite dead/dying? Do any of your friends play anymore? 

Are you excited for this next season/the end of this season? Do you think it will help Fortnite or will it be its death sentence?",FortNiteBR

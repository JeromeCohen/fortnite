I propose that the max amount of damage, to the body, for the Heavy Sniper should be 142/145 or 145/148 (or somewhere in the 140-149 range).

I feel this would be a great change as, most of the time, we have minis and are only able to get to 150 health at the moment, or, for the rest of the game, which means we would have to rely on rng many times for circle locations that offers mushrooms or big shields from chests that aren't open or that were left on the ground. And even then, getting lucky enough to find chests unopened would be another obstacle.

This allows us to survive that 150 body shot with 9 hp or less.",FortNiteBR

We wanted to drop in and give a status update on stability issues we’ve been seeing on mobile. Since the launch of Season 8, we’ve noticed a number of quality-of-life issues that we should have communicated better and earlier.

Our previous efforts towards mobile stability tended to focus on top crashes and issues found after each release across both iOS and Android. Focusing on platform-wide issues, however, meant we missed what we now discovered to be a frequently occurring GPU hang specific to iPhone 8. We’ve corrected this hole in our process and will have better oversight on individual devices moving forward. For those of you experiencing the GPU hang, we’ve been able to reproduce the issue and are actively working towards a fix.

We’ve also noticed new voice chat issues and more frequent network disconnects on mobile since the launch of Season 8. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, various items/features may be briefly taken offline while we investigate a variety of issues. We appreciate your continued feedback so we can resolve issues that occur and continue working towards making Fortnite Mobile the best possible gaming experience. Check out our [Official Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues) for a list of the top known issues we’re tracking that mobile players are experiencing.

Thank you!

I don't think they will.be added as a new vehicle. But if they were. I have ideas that could make them more balanced than the planes were. 

- Maximum capacity of 4 
- 2 player/s can sit in the back of the copter and shoot
- Speed would be relatively the same as the planes. 
- Spawn at outposts and would have a entitled building at Titled Towers and Frosty Flights with a 100% Spawn rate helicopter spawned on a helipad on the roof

- Mounted Minigun/s

- 22 damage per hit to player
- 44 damage per hit to structure
- Wind up time would be 4.34 seconds
- Overheats after 8 seconds. 

What do you think?

I wouldn't have an issue with epic games if they *ONLY* celebrated international and American events like Christmas, 4th of July, black Friday, new years or valentines day but since 2018 they started celebrating other cultures most obviously dia de Los Muertos and Carnaval (yes that's how it's spelt) but to this day there is no hint of Indian culture which honestly has way more depth and opportunity than other celebrations. I know that it is painstakingly long to develop game modes or item shop items but I think that even a small gesture like a text post on the news screen or re-releasing an emote (like sparkler on Diwali)  would be great. It would be nice if you would acknowledge a vast majority of your audience and fanbase. 
P.S: it would even encourage more players to play if you establish a competitive scene here like was done in Korea and I know this since PUBG was free and popular but blew up after the tournaments.

I'll have had a pretty good day for the most part before getting on, and then a few lost games because of an Omega or John Wick later, and my day will have gone down the drain.
The problem is: I still want to play and get good at the game. I've been playing since the beginning of Season 6, and while I'm still not that good of a player (only 2 wins), I have a ton of fond memories. My first kill, my first win, Kevin exploding, using the Sword for the first time, the list goes on. But now, I just don't have those moments anymore. Just frustration, at the game and at myself for still being bad a the game after putting so much time and effort into it.
So maybe I won't permanently leave, just take a week or two off, maybe the rest of the season if I really feel like I need to.

I’ve recently moved it to several different spots in my house, including next to my router. After struggling with lag regularly, I decided to plug my controller into my $300 HP laptop, where even with a stretched res, i only get about 60 FPS, and I can honestly say that I’m having a better time on what you could barely call a PC, and I was wondering, am I the only one who is constantly having these problems on console as of recent?",FortNiteBR

Many people are leaving, including my core squad who are die hards that have all spent several hundred dollars on skins etc. since we started back in season 2. I have been thinking about ways to bring some balance back into the game and I had these few ideas. Let me know what you think of them. 

1. Remove or alter the syphon mechanic. The mechanic is a great addition to the game. I actually enjoy it and my KD has gone up as a result. However it allows the best players to dominate every lobby since they will almost always be at full health full shield. It takes away most threats of being third partied. That has made it so you can attack without strategically thinking about exposing yourself. Before the mechanic there was a risk/reward with the timing of your attack. Now it's just go in guns blazing with no fear of who is waiting in the bushes. While that's great for the top 5-10% of players it's really bad for the rest of us. Additionally the mechanic has made taking healing items a thing of the past. Since I usually fill up my health by thirsting enemies I only carry shields now. The mechanic has taken strategic healing almost entirely out of the game. If Epic wants to keep the mechanic try dropping it to 25 health or shield and let's see the effect it has on gameplay. 

2. Slow down turbo build speed. There was a time you would be shooting a guy who is replacing his walls and you'd get a couple hits on him per clip. Now with the build being so fast it's almost impossible to hit anybody as the walls come up as fast as the bullets fly. That has led to more turtling and more overbuilding in general. The person on the defensive end of that exchange shouldn't be rewarded for being caught out of position. They should be forced to fight back instead of being encouraged to hide.

3. Add more build counters. If turbo build speed isn't changed then add more counters to building. I know the pro scene loses their minds at the thought of anybody countering their turtle nests but the rest of us mostly enjoy the counters. I know we have dynamite but that's a slow way to counter. With the speed of turbo building any good player can be 20 meters away from the dynamite before it explodes. The game needs quick counters that don't necessarily take out a city block but that do enough structure damage to allow the attacking player a sliver of a window to flip the fight in their favor.

To keep the pros happy Epic can tweak their events to give them the gameplay they want while keeping normal lobbies a bit more balanced for the rest of us. They host game modes with separate mechanics all the time so what I'm asking isn't unheard of.

I'm just a regular adult who loves this game and recognizes what potential it has. I don't want to see the player base fleeing because they no longer can compete. Epic has to make adjustments soon or they will lose people to inferior games like Apex. I'm not whining about the game but rather offering constructive criticism about the current state of balance. Please read this in that manner. Thanks for your feedback and I hope to see you on the island. 

TL;DR - The game needs a balance rework. Syphon mechanic tweaks, turbo build speed reduction, and build counters should all be looked at to help achieve this. The pro events should be balanced separately from regular lobbies to keep everyone happy-ish.",FortNiteBR

First I wanted start off stating I am a 40 year old father who was convinced to play Fortnite BR by my 3 children, niece and nephew midway through last season. I wanted EPIC and this awesome community to know it has been an awesome gaming experience so far. My family and I all play on XBOX 1 and wanted to ask a honest question to everyone. Why is the XBOX community being paired with PC in Fortnite BR? I see a lot of PC and very few XBOX and PS4 players in my game lobbies. I feel PC should be by themselves. XBOX should be paired with PS4 and Nintendo switch paired with mobile. This is my opinion and wanted to how others fell about this new addition to the game. Thank you everyone for allowing me to be apart of this great community.

I know tons of other people have ranted about this, but I just need to get my point across. Fortnite is not fun for the more casual players. Meaning fortnite is losing players. Which is why if epic wants to keep their game running, they are going to need to add some sort of ranked system going across all servers. Although the system I have in mind wouldnt calculate your level or whatever. It would calculate how many kills you get,and how far into the game you get. Of course tryhards could abuse this by purposefully being bad a few rounds and then get an easy win or two. Still. It would make the game more fun for casual players.

Also dont yell at me in he comments like OGM UR BAD GIT GUD N00B XDDDD!!!!!!!

I rarely ever play fortnite. Im more into FH4 then anything. Fortnite is just not fun. I mean SOMETIMES its fun. But thats only like (QUICK MATHS) 0.5 PERCENT OF THE TIME. Seriously. Creative isnt even that fun. Because even with X-Box group posts (suck it PC users!) You cant even make a post asking people if they want to FFA on a cool farm map you created (like me) most of the time you get stuck with  6th grade soccer skins that scream because you wont enable building (like I do) or people that scream because they dont have a rocket launcher and keep getting freight-trained out of their minds by a tactical shotgun and tac-SMG. Seriously. Its not fun anymore for casual players. So again. Epic. If you want to keep your game running, add a ranked system. Not a gamemode. Across ALL servers and LTM's that dont let you respawn. Again. The ranked system would track your elimination count, and how far you make it into the match. Seriously. This would bring back lots of players.",FortNiteBR

Bloom is one of the reasons why Fortnite will never be a true esports or competitive game. You probably know what Bloom is, but to clear up, Bloom is essentially a mechanic in shooting where your bullet goes in a random, inconsistent pattern. This creates a non-competitive field because of how unfair Bloom is in how random your shots can be. The amounts of tactics of reducing bloom help, but it needs to be removed. If Epic were to replace this mechanic with Recoil, Fortnite could be a potential esports or competitive game because of how consistent recoil is. Like for Bloom, for people who don’t know what recoil is, Recoil is a mechanic in shooting where your bullet goes in a consistent pattern. Recoil is used in games like CSGO. CSGO is a competitive game because of how fair it is with recoil. I always feel like it’s my fault whenever I get killed by someone in that game, but when I get killed in Fortnite, i see it as unfair when they get better luck in their shots. That’s my reason why Fortnite needs to remove Bloom, it’s an inconsistent shooting mechanic that reduces the already weakened competitive field that’s within the game. If Fortnite were to add Recoil, the game would feel more fair and the game would have a better competitive field.",FortNiteBR

Here’s What Would Change This.,"The meta at it’s current state is getting boring. While nothing is considerably overpowered, the meta of Scar/pump/smg is getting really old and stale. These changes would attempt to change this by bringing some overshadowed weapons back into consideration. 



*Infantry rifle*: 

- Increase clip size from 8 to 15
	- The infantry rifle is decent, but the skill gap for using it very high, leading many players to hate it. This would make it a bit easier to use, and also make it better at taking out structures compared to other ARs. 


*Pump Shotgun*: 

- Decrease base damage from 95/100/105/110 to 90/95/100/105
	- The pump is pretty much the only weapon in the game that is essential to an end-game loadout. This change would decrease the weapon’s power while also putting more disparity between the green/blue variants and the purple/gold variants.


*Tactical Shotgun*: 

- Adjust spread pattern, range to match the Heavy Shotgun, increase headshot multiplier to 2.5 from 2
	- The main problem with the tac is that the pump can simply output a much higher amount of damage with greater consistency and at greater range. By basically combining the tac and heavy into a single weapon, this would provide a suitable alternative to running a pump.


*Dual Pistols*: 

- Decrease equip time by 40%, decrease reload time by 20% 
	- Dual pistols can be very powerful and quite effective early game, but really serve no purpose past this. By making them equip and reload faster, they would become a much more viable option in the slot of “shotgun swap” weapon. 


*Compact SMG*:

- Fire rate increased from 10 to 11 (DPS from 200/210 to 220/231)
	- This change would not make any drastic difference to the effectiveness of this weapon, but would solidify it as clearly better than the Silenced SMG, which right now outclasses the compact in every way. Keep in mind, this is still very far from it’s OP season 5 stats, where it did far more damage, structure damage, and had more range. I am not suggesting a return to that meta.


*Silenced Pistol*: 

- Accuracy increase by 30%
	- Being consistent with the other silenced weapons, this gun should be far more accurate than it is. 


*Silenced AR*: 

- Maximum spread decreased by 40%
	- This thing is supposed to be the most accurate AR, but after 5 continuous shots, the spread on this thing becomes unbearable. This change would mitigate this and make the silenced AR a much more viable choice vs. the SCAR. ",FortNiteBR

Let’s go back to the origins of double pump: season 2. I’m not gonna lie, this was an absolute monster and there was no way it could stay in the game balanced. And yes, they did remove double pump temporarily through season 3, but it was brought back slightly nerfed some time in April. This double pump was still kind of overpowered, but nowhere near the season 2 menace of double pump. 

But finally, the dreaded June 5 patch came. Pumps were nerfed for 10 body damage (from 90/95 to 80/85) and their headshot multiplier (and the tac’s) was reduced to 2x (from 2.5x), and explosives were hugely buffed. From this point on, double pump became more balanced, but pump/tac was now a weaker option, but still viable. This left people searching for other metas. 

Conveniently, the tac SMG was also greatly buffed around this time, so we saw the rise of pump/SMG (yes, pump/SMG was a big thing before season 5). So now, we had people double pumping, using pump/tac, and using pump/SMG. This was a good point for the game, with people using a variety of weapons at close range.

Fast forward to season 5, where the shotgun cooldown was implemented. From this point onward, the only meta at close range would he pump/SMG. Tacs are now useless by themselves, since building makes the quick fire rate pointless, and headshots are not rewarded as much as they used to be. And this has been the meta ever since. There have been almost no changes, except for new SMG’s to use as a backup to the pump (drum gun, compact, suppressed replacing regular SMG)

Here are my ideas for changes to bring back a healthy amount of close-range variety:

-remove shotgun cooldown
-increase pump draw speed to 0.47 seconds for green/blue (from 0.41) and 0.41 for purple/gold (from 0.33)
-decrease pump damage from 95/100/105/110 to 90/95/100/105
-increase headshot multiplier for tactical shotgun back to 2.5x

Hear me out.,"TL;DR : Getting 5 Wins within 4 or 5 days is EXTREME for a lot players.If Epic wanted to make a very hard challenge then ignore this post. 

I never was so stressed out in an LTM then High Stakes. In order to get the white llama, which looks awesome, you have to get 5 wins within 4 or 5 days. The thing is that winning in High Stakes in this slow period of time is super stressful. A lot of people also have work to do and cant always play so its ridiculous that we dont have like 7 days for this LTM.

Also in my opinion this LTM needs improvements. Yes i get that when you carry the Llama you are slower, but when you realize how much damage the storm does makes it absurd. i got into so many matches where the fight was in the zone where the enemy dropped the llama , i picked it up and just could not get out of the zone because the Storm is doing so much damage.(and i was the last one alive). Frustration i tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

The end game of High Stakes is one of the MOST stressful i had, nothing is more frustrating then when you got the llama, build up to one of the Vans and someone breaks your stairs and you fall to your death.

Getting those wins is ridiculous .I wanted to enjoy this LTM but i just cant either because how freaking unforgiving/hard this LTM is or how little time we have to get those wins.

&amp;#x200B;

When we had to kill 20 Golden zombie brutes during the Zombie LTM people freaked out how hard it was and EPIC changed that, but i have not seen a single post where someone complaint either how hard the challenges are or how little time we have to do during High Stakes.

I am open to whatever people say, but i think we all could profit if EPIC would make the challenges less hard ( 3 wins to get the white Llama) or that we get MUCH more time for this LTM when you consider people have work to do and have to take care of things.We all could profit from this.

4. Eon (costs $300, codes can be bought for $50. Sucks because it has no back bling like it should)

Adding the casual PS4 crowd has really helped lower the standard of pub lobbies on Xbox which is definitely a good thing in my book.

However there’s one fundamental problem now. Lobbies are now getting only 1-3 Sweat lord players now which means every solo game is nigh on impossible to win unless you’re a 3.00kd+ calibre player. The past 3 games I’ve played I finished second to a guy that had 10+ kills... it’s not a case of getting good either. Because that level of skill is far higher than the average players skill ceiling. You simply can’t compete against players that good. I’m still searching for my first solo win of season 8. It’s so frustrating.

Hopefully this leads to development of small team playlists such as 6v6 TDM, search and destroy, or capture the flag in enclosed POIs or user generated maps. POIs that have been removed from the game such as greasy grove, moisty mire, factories, etc. could be turned into small team maps and brought back to life. 

Fortnites gunplay is unparalleled by any other game and it would be great to see how it works in a non BR setting. 

Suggestion: Team Deathmatch

• 6v6


•weapon preferences chosen in game menu (heavy AR vs. AR, Tac vs. Pump)


• throwables found in random loot spawns, spawning intermittently throughout rounds/games. 


•Farming rate increased, 300/300/300 mat cap


•Speakers placed around map to clear areas of players builds, the speakers will sound every 2 minutes (or when a specific # of materials have been used) and break builds
 


•30/30/30 materials and a stack of ammunition dropped upon elimination, dropped ammunition size dependent on the gun used to eliminate the player. this will promote movement, as this is the only way to obtain ammunition. 


•spawns placed around in random houses and areas, player respawn location dependent on current team location 


that’s just a rough idea of what could be, any other input is welcomed",FortNiteBR

- Scoped Revolver : Rare/Epic. This weapon Is very good, but not enough for being Legendary. It would be Better as rare/Epic, like the old scoped AR.

- Tactical Shotgun : Uncommon/Rare/Epic : this weapon previously featured this rarity, and think It needs it again. It is the fastest pump in the game, and, especially the rare version, its damage is consistent.

I reckon this is because of the mix with the mobile pool.

I imagine this isnt very good either for mobile players as they are going against players using a controler or even the superior gyro controls.

I think to make things fair, either:

1. The switch is moved back to being with PS4 and XBox 1.

2. Only handheld switch players are matched with mobile lobbies.

3. The switch has the option between mobile and console pools.

The latter one is less likely but it is an option. Maybe if you chose mobile lobbies wins dont count?

Regardless, any solution to this would be great as my experience on switch has declined since the change.

Also, anybody else use the gyro controls?",FortNiteBR

However that did not last long. So I decided to quit. But Fortnite please make your match making only for your skill level not people higher than you. Because I have played at least 100 games now every game just kept on dying not even getting a kill. Fortnite again please try to solve this problem so players can feel comfortable playing with their own skill level and not just dying every time. If you guys fix this problem I bet there is going to be a lot of players coming back or even joining the game. Thanks for reading this.",FortNiteBR

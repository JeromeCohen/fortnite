Arena does not fit the criteria of a proper Ranked system in my opinion. It's """"""Ranking System"""""" is a load of baloney, you could sit in a Baller for every game with little effort and easily make it to Champions league with enough time. Isn't a Ranking System supposed to be something that matches you with opponents of similar skill? I don't think camping all game is a skillfull thing. 

What we need is a proper ranking mode, actual Skill Based Matchmaking not this, ""hype"" system they have. 

There's so much potential with Arena and Epic barely even scratched the surface of it.",FortNiteBR

I've played since early s5 and the game was good . Changes after changes and the game just became unplayable for the casual gamers. I've had like 60 vr in solos and a few in squad , I'm no pro by any means but the game felt like you can have vr every now and then . Streamers react and give voice to their frustrations but I've never once have seen anyone talking about this : Why streamers (the minority) think the game is better off being catered towards them . Watch streams , I watch them and the best of them I even follow , they get such a matchmaking where players don't even shoot back , or build , or realise that they are being pushed , and no ... not because of the positioning of the pros or cos they are so good that the average player seems like a noob in front of them. They reason with being a content creator is their job and their job and life is in risk cos epic games don't listen to them . Every time I watch ""Thatdenverguy"" talk about this I lose it . They earn money by playing the game and they imagine the less skilled players who want to enjoy the game , just will be thrown for them as food just cos they have to create a content.  We don't care . We play to have fun . That is what a game should be about , and once you don't have fun in the game  it's best to stop playing and wasting time on it imo. Crossplay , ruined fortnite , clearly matchmaking isn't as they say in solos .I've encountered many PC players and I only play on switch. Frequent changes , they fix something and just ruin it again in the next patch. Since s6 every time there is an update , when you land everything is blurred. You lose right off the bat . Stupid weapon changes. Removing the pump was the last drop for me. The signature weapon of fortnite. The satisfaction it gave when you popped off someone was enough to play the game . Vehicles  and slipstream  and I  could go on . To me fortnite is dead .",FortNiteBR

This is seemed to be caused by the animation resetting itself after the 4th swing.

Okay so I knew I wasn't crazy when I noticed dual pickaxes seem to have a delay while swinging continuously. To preface, each swing takes exactly 0.500 seconds. This means when you swing, it takes exactly half a second to swing again. This is how it should be. But, for every swing after the 4th swing, it takes longer to achieve the 5th swing. The delay is approximately 0.683 seconds in between swings. Here are my stats from taking a video and recording the time of each swing (these are rough estimates because the video FPS and timeline did not allow for fine-tuning these values):

Swing 1: 1.800

Swing 2: 2.366

Swing 3: 2.983

Swing 4: 3.483

Swing 5: 4.166

Kids whined so much about shop skins coming back, and were so greedy in their approach that it ended up leaving everyone in a negative space when it came to any problems with skins.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at what is going on right now, We have 2 sides of the fence and no one is getting anywhere. For the longest time, people who were against the og crybabies used the defense ""It is a shop skin, the only items to ever be said to be exclusive were BP skins."" But now, no one cares about that anymore, no one sees it that way because they are so tired of the stupid posts about asking for a selectable style for a shop skin for those who purchased it first, when this is nothing like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try and take out your own personal bias, whether you like the new skin, or  if you think the whole ""OG"" thing is cringey as all hell like i do, and think about it. This isn't a shop skin that they are copying, it was an item that was said to never be returned, now epic hasn't brought back out the original, but damn are they trying to use any kind of loophole they can to get away with it.. That and they are using the fact that people are so divided against each other when it comes to this topic to get away with it even easier, simply because anytime someone complains about it, there will be plenty who tell them to ""ShUt Up AbOuT yOuR Og SkIn CoMiNg BaCk."" They know that there will be a portion of the playerbase that will defend them, and they are using it to their advantage. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not mad that i didn't get the new skin as a style, or that i didn't get it for free, i am upset and disappointed because it shows that epic is really willing to put their playerbases trust on the back burner if it means they will make some money. The jokes are already happening ""Waiting for Summer omega, Waiting for Summer/white Knight."" And with people just accepting this new skin, it opens the door for epic to do this again, and again. Now, with all that being said, i am willing to respond to comments, but only if they are trying to actually have a discussion about this. Hope you all have a good day.",FortNiteBR

3) Good damage, good range, good sound, good looking - nothing can beat the **heavy shotgun.**

4) **Combat shotgun** \- a really good one but it is so low because its spawn rate is very low and has HUGE range as for shotgun.

The game starts off normally, this could be squads, duos, or solos. The zone moves from one side of the map to the opposite end and slowly decreases in size. The fourth or fifth zone will be off the map, over the water. And it is up to you, or your team, to build strong bases to support yourself over the water. 

&amp;#x200B;

This mode would need compensation for the amount of materials used to sustain yourself above the water. I was thinking that we could regenerate materials just like you could in the floor is lava game mode.

Few days later the skin was ‚Äúrefunded‚Äù even though he did not request any refund on anything. To make this clear he made no request of a refund of any item or v buck purchase. He was afraid he would miss out on the skin due to the event ending so he bought it a second time. Again, the skin was taken from his account. Both times, 700 v bucks were returned to his account when the skin costs 1500. When contacting customer support we were told to contact Microsoft that it‚Äôs their issue. We bought it on the Switch which is Nintendo. They said that if a refund on v bucks was requested and if there are not enough v bucks on the account to give back then cosmetic items will be taken instead. He made no refund request. Then I get a survey on our support experience which tells me the ticket has been closed. This is a horrible thing to basically steal money and items from anyone let alone a 13 yr old who worked for every cent he spent. By the way the phone number was useless and only directs you to the customer support email. Any ideas or suggestions?

(Let me explain),"Think back to when Fortnite was in its prime (Season 2-4) getting rushed by enemies meant you actually had to fight them unless you had a launchpad and then possibly could escape but there was a 50/50 chance the enemy would shoot it down before you used it so you‚Äôd be forced to stay and fight. You could actually concentrate on fighting the other team unless some other team luckily was near by and decided to 3rd party which was a lot less common than it is now. Since nowadays someone gets down to 50 health, uses a rift-to-go that takes them to max height and they fly across the map and land in the Slipstream where they fly in circles until the enemy gives up. Rift-to-gos unlike Launchpads and Glider Redeploy takes zero skill and building to use. You could be anywhere on the map and a rift-to-go will instantly give you height advantage. Rift-to-gos and the Slipstream have made Fortnite players more lazy. Back in Season2-4 if you landed far away from the circle you had to leave to start running at least a minute before the storm started moving in. Nowadays people are so thirsty that they go into the storm to fight people knowing they can just quickly get into the Slipstream or use a rift afterwards to escape the storm. The rifts and Slipstream gives everyone an easy no building required way to land right inside of enemies bases when before in S2-S4 getting on a mountain was the safest place to be",FortNiteBR

A Shadow Bomb store where there's 4 Shadow Bomb drops on its shelves.

Reply with anything you agree/disagree with

Vault: 
Tactical Shotgun 
Pistol
Burst Smg
Heavy Sniper
(Green-Blue) Infantry Rifle
- this helps the overly diluted loot pool, there is now a group of Rifles besides the standard AR with the AK taking the Grey-Blue variants and the infantry being the Purple/Gold
Suppressed Sniper
Drum Gun
Rocket Launcher 
Grenade Launcher

- Overall there are too many weapons/items in the loot pool at the moment. This will help solve the problem, but keep reading to see what variants come back

Unvault:
Pump Shotgun (Green/Blue) 
- Nerf damage to 90/95 with 2x headshot multiplier 
Submachine Gun (most recent)
- change all stats to the vaulted suppressed smg (would be the same as unvaulting the suppressed smg but taking away the suppressor) 
Bolt-Action Sniper (Rare/Epic)
- Damage is 90/95
- Headshot damage is over 200

Other Balance Changes:
- Max stink bombs/dynamite reduced to 4

General:
All chests spawn 100% of the time:
- Each chest spawns one heal
- 30% - 3 mini shields
- 25% - 5 bandages 
- 15% - big shield
- 15% - med kit
- 10% - slurp juice 
- 5% - chug jug

Slot-designated Weapons:
- Option to select preferred weapons for each of the five inventory slots. Select a weapons type for a slot. When that weapon is picked up, it will automatically be put it into that slot. If that slot is filled(Slot 1 for example), it will go into the slot to the right (slot 2), unless the slot to the right (slot 2) already has a weapon in the correct slot. If this occurs, it goes into the slot to the right of that one (would be slot 3) until there is a slot open. Obvoius

Competitive mode harvest rate, mat cap, siphon, and material rewards are the same. 

Controller weapon loadout binds:
- Can bind specific buttons to each loadout slot. 
- Ex: Slot1 - RB
- 2 - LB
- 3 - Double tap RB
- 4 - Double tap LB
- 5 - RB+LB

Aim Assist is not dependent on FPS:
- Right now, the more FPS you have the stronger the ‚Äúlock-on‚Äù feature of the aim assist is. Should be changed so the current aim assist strength at 100 FPS is the same for all players. 
A true ranked system:
- Arena needs a massive overhaul. The new system would reset every season allow deranking between divisions. In order for their to not be inflation and no ‚Äúfree-passes‚Äù, bus fare needs to be the same across all divisons, but possibly different between solo/duo. 
- There are tournaments held for each division near the end of the season. Vbucks and skins are rewards. The top performers of the highest division can be qualified for the next World Cup.",FortNiteBR

 Why even do Fortnite so many weapon changes? I mean the old Heavy Shotgun was perfect and everything. But now? Its over patched with the weapons. The changes on the Map and Gameplay its fine but the weapons are not my type anymore. Super sad :(

347,carterjpeg,1561356208,c4j1va,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/c4j1va/epic_games_please_read/,0,Epic games please read,"I don‚Äôt know how to start this other than saying this is feedback from a non emotion driven opinion, just views based on what I‚Äôve seen. Fortnite competitive and aggressive play are different things, but lately there has been no difference. I‚Äôm Seeing an overwhelming amount of ‚Äútryhards‚Äù (usually wearing a soccer skin with a cape) that build a ton and ‚Äúsweat‚Äù every game. I understand that they might be trying to get better to become popular, but EVERYONE has to do it now just to stay alive, which has created a toxic environment for the game. I think that passive play needs to be considered more. This is not life or death, but because the game is so popular, people are starting to treat it like it is, and, well, it‚Äôs not exactly helping to introduce a competitive twitter and change the loot pool just for that audience. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this might be a little bit biased because I am a casual player, but I‚Äôm having to learn how to do 90s and turtle for TEAM RUMBLE! I‚Äôm no one to say this, but you shouldn‚Äôt let that audience control your game, which they seem to be doing. Fortnite is an online, free to play video game, and just because it‚Äôs popular shouldn‚Äôt mean that all the fans should feel like they need to be the best. And although I‚Äôve tried, there is no way to get through to them that they won‚Äôt be the next tfue or Ninja. So I kindly suggest that you look into the current loot pool and gameplay, and look at gameplay footage of, say, Season 3 or something close, and look at the amount of passive play in each. I, speaking on behalf of your audience that doesn‚Äôt communicate online to you, ask for more catering to passive play. (Also, please don‚Äôt forget to remember that just because a small amount expresses their opinion online, and lots, as an example, voted for the drum gun in the unvaulting event, does not immediately mean that they all think that way, it‚Äôs probably just as diverse as the percent that do express themselves) Thank you for reading, sorry I wrote this much, but I still love your game and don‚Äôt want to leave it because of this like so many have. &lt;3",FortNiteBR

349,SoBasicallyImMonky,1561354713,c4iu77,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/c4iu77/why_fortnite_isnt_as_fun_as_it_used_to_be/,0,Why Fortnite isn‚Äôt as fun as it used to be,"Personally I believe  Fortnite is not as fun due to the meta and all of the balancing that needs to be fixed. The meta and weapon pool at the moment is just not fun, guns like the combat shotgun, drum gun and what was the boom bow are just incredibly annoying and not fun to use, the combat shotgun is just shoot 10x rather than the previous meta that was pump 1x then SMG until the shotgun delay was over which wasn‚Äôt as annoying being used against you and using as the combat shotgun with its literal 100m range and 2 shots per second if you don‚Äôt have one there is a 5% chance of winning against it. And The Drum gun has far too much ammo for the damage it puts out to players and structures it is also available in green rarity which lets it be found so easily, when use against you in a box it can put more pressure against you than a hydraulic press. Those 2 guns just aren‚Äôt fun balanced and overall should just be replaced with something new or different (THE PUMP)

Aside from weapons the ballers are just so annoying as it allows players to move so fast if used right to get out of low hp situations which is usually annoying for the opposing player as they don‚Äôt get a kill, loot and mats after all they used against them. Also the noobs/bots get to sit back in a ball all game and not get any better and be left behind as the skill gap gets bigger and bigger not giving them an opportunity to get good.

We truly need Health per kill and mats on kill back in the game right now because it is just 3rd party after 3rd party and getting a kill after a big long fight being left on 40hp doesn‚Äôt give you anything your left to use the minis that were left, that‚Äôs it and then another player comes along and just kills you with their 200hp 999 999 999 mats while you have no chance as you didn‚Äôt get any health or mats from the other player giving you no fighting chance. The game right now is not letting players get as high kill games as before due to the no HPK and MPK as your left really weak and not being able to be aggressive because you die due to low health and mats. 

Season 7 was a peak for gameplay in Fortnite in my eyes due to there being fun events, good balancing, fun weapons, a good meta,fun vehicles besides the plane which doesn‚Äôt mean much due to there being so much good stuff, and overall the community at the time because it was Christmas as well. Sadly though looking at Fortnite in its currents state it is losing popularity, not well balanced, not fun, not a good meta, bad vehicles, the store is almost constant copies, many glitches, the community isn‚Äôt as healthy as it was before and the map is just filled with trash and not a good proper battle ground. 

Another thing that is needed is the material cap and gain it was much easier to work with as build fights didn‚Äôt happen to much leading to 3rd parties, spamming wasn‚Äôt to much of a problem as we would have more a lot faster making spamming  much more tolerable than it is right now because the game has go a spam version of each weapon which isn‚Äôt fun.

We need the pump, burst, all of the previous smgs, hunting rifle and the bolt back as they were good balanced and fun and to use. Replacements for all weapons ‚Äî&gt; pump &gt; combat, burst &gt; AK, silenced smg &gt; Burst smg, any smg &gt; drum gun, hunting rifle &gt; semi and we just need the bolt back because it‚Äôs the first sniper and the father of them all. 

If HPK &amp; MPK, all the weapons above are replaced, they remove ballers, change the mats back 500 each and faster gain, and juice up the item store the game will be fun and not be slowly dying and I would be happy to come home and play it with the boys.",FortNiteBR

Not even just bugs, problems with the core gameplay. 

First problem: The meta. This meta is ridiculously spammy. Spam shotgun, spam ar, spam drum, spam sniper, spam splodes. 

It‚Äôs honesty completely unenjoyable and it really ruins my drive to grind and get better at the game. 

Second problem: The loot pool. The loot pool is filled with useless items that are way more common than the items/weapons you actually need. The burst smg/common heavy ar each have a 10 percent spawn chance. That means 20 percent of the time you open a chest you‚Äôre going to get a useless pathetic piece of shit gun. 

Ground loot is even worse, the only guns you can find on ground loot nowadays are white pistols and white tacs. 

Another thing with the loot pool is the utility vs heal spawn chance. Every single chest either has impulses/boogies/redeploys, in a meta where you are guaranteed to take massive damage during any fight, heals need to be wayyyyy more common. 

Third problem: Balance. I could go on for days about the tac spawn rate. The tactical shotgun is useless. Plain and simple. In a meta where a combat is necessary to stand any chance whatsoever, but the only gun you can ever find is a tac, it‚Äôs completely and totally busted. The COMBAT SHOTGUN IS THE SINGLE MOST NECESSARY AND CRUCIAL WEAPON IN THE GAME, BUT IT ONLY HAS A **LESS THAN 2% SPAWN RATE**

That makes zero sense whatsoever to me. 

Fourth Problem: The map. I‚Äôve never had a problem with any of the map changes until this season. The map is just clogged with new stuff every season, but it‚Äôs still the same old map underneath. It‚Äôs tacky, it looks like it‚Äôs rushed. The new poi‚Äôs make no sense compared to the rest of the map. The slipstreams encourage third partying (talk about unhealthy aggression). 

Last problem: This may be just for me and a relatively small percent of the player base, but this game is rage inducing like no other game I‚Äôve ever played before. When you loot and farm for 15 minutes only to get shit on by someone with a combat when you don‚Äôt have one, it can make you pretty angry. Not to mention the amount of bugs that happen mid fight, or the ridiculous amounts of third partying that make fighting one team turn into 2-3 more teams all at once. It‚Äôs a complete and total shitfest, and it frustrates the hell out of me because I love this game. 

Tl;dr game is busted, completely unenjoyable for any player who wants to win but doesn‚Äôt devote their life to the game.",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm a 18 year old guy and used to play Fortnite a lot, and I mean A LOT. I was addicted and played it everyday, in other words I loved it. 

When it was most popular(1-1,5 years ago) I was really good at the game and finishing top 5 every game, always jumping Tilted, always pushing etc...

So, six months ago me and my friends wanted to go back to Fortnite and take a break from Apex and other games.  Furthermore the first thing we notice is that we are much worse at the game. But we fight trough it, and we becomes relatively comfortable.

HERE COMES WHAT I WANT TO SAY

We know Fortnite have made a lot of changes, both good and bad. But know we find Fortnite as a much less skill based game. 
Why? 
(This point don‚Äôt cover pc)
‚ÄúThe Aim assist players have is incredible‚Äù, it can‚Äôt be unnoticed. It‚Äôs almost useless to carry a sniper nowadays because of the capability of the Ars. I can laser a guy, easy from 200 feet. And not to mention shooting and connecting shots while flying which was impossible back in the day. 

(This does)
‚ÄúTransportation is so much easier‚Äù, I see why Epic games creates transportation ways like zip lines, slipstreams and vehicles. It makes it more fun, sure. BUT the drawback of this is that it makes third parrying possible in a whole new level. Additionally from the previous point that you can shoot from miles away. The playstyle I have (pushing like a maniac) is not possible. 

Also, Something really irritating is the bloom which we all have. It‚Äôs all luck and punish all players. It‚Äôs completely random. Remove it and the good players that are actually hitting its target are rewarded. 

These are the two major problems with Fortnite and Makes the game freaking terrible. And yes I know Fortnite targets a younger age and adjust it to fit their skills bla bla bla. But freak.

SOLUTION: 
Make a game mode with the old map old weapons, old op:s and Old gameplay. Bring back greasy, pump (not dubble pump) retail. And no brutal aim assist for console. If they could remove all the stupid vehicles and For instance rifts I would be grateful.  The list goes on.

Through searching trying to fix this issue, I‚Äôve seen that this has been an issue for a while now and allegedly there was gonna a fix this year.

Situation:
My son downloaded and started playing Fortnite on our PS4 (we will call this PlayStation A) a few months back. He‚Äôs been playing on switch for a while previously. 
Fast forward to now, he‚Äôs old enough so we buy him a PS4 of his own to put in his room. (PlayStation B)

We create a PSN account for him on his console so he can buy stuff, get games, do whatever. 
Download Fortnite on his PlayStation and try to figure out to get his account on the new PlayStation.  

Keeping his switch stuff primary as that‚Äôs where all his purchased stuff is? We try to link PlayStation B to his epic account only to find out it‚Äôs locked to PlayStation A and can‚Äôt be unbound. 

Epic customer ‚Äúsupport‚Äù only provides general blanket statement of ‚Äúfor security reasons we are unable to unlink accounts‚Äù

To me I find this ridiculous. It‚Äôs 2019.  How about verify my identity and let me manage my accounts. We‚Äôve spent a truck load of money on this damn game in the house yet we can‚Äôt have simple account management options? And there‚Äôs no real warning from epic about not being able to do this unless you plow through pages of the internet looking for other people kissed about the same issue, but that‚Äôs probably after you have already passed the point of no return. 

Epic‚Äôs solution :  log into PS4 B with PS4 A‚Äôs PSN account. 
Really ....that‚Äôs your work around?! 
Will 2 PlayStation‚Äôs even allow you to be logged in under the same PSN account at the same time and play games online? 

Essentially we have purchased a new console that my son can‚Äôt use properly because Epic won‚Äôt let us manage our own damn account. 

End Angry dad mode.

#let me explain.

Stinkbombs are among one of the most effortless ways to wither someone's health to the point of an easy kill. With 3 stinkbombs per pickup, the player running will get constantly pummeled and according to the player, might lose half their health. I'm talking about giving stinks one bounce before explosion. Makes it so players need to show more effort. Ex: throwing a stink bomb at a tall 1 by 1 tower. The player in it will need to push sideways which may always result in them being shot down. By adding an extra bounce, a player might need to kobe that stink inside the 1 by 1, which bounces off the ramp, and hits the wall inside. I believe the damage is very fair, but with newbies and maybe some pro players carrying maybe 9 at a time, could get you killed.

Hope you agree!",FortNiteBR

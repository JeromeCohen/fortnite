This is when fortnite hit its peak for me, I‚Äôm not a pro, but I would consider myself a good player and so do many of my friends. Well think of how you guys just hated dying every game and think how is good players feel now, every pub game I play is just a shit show but casuals enjoy it, this game shouldn‚Äôt just be solely built around casuals, we want to have fun too. I‚Äôve spent more time in the other mode this season rather than pubs by atleast double. Epic needs to wake up and learn that arena and pubs NEED separate loot pools/ game mechanics. This would make everyone happy and let everyone enjoy the game again... not just the casuals.

Tldr- casuals have fun, no one is against that, but let the better players also have fun by separating loot pools and game mechanics from arena and pubs",FortNiteBR

There‚Äôs literally no reason to swap them, the damage difference between the two is so minute it‚Äôs almost completely negligible, same goes for the reload time. The only real, noticeable difference is the fact that one has a suppressor and that makes it objectively better for use as a sniper. They‚Äôre nearly identical otherwise and can both one shot to the head and two shot to the body at full health and shield. 

Literally the only reason I can imagine anyone wanting the bolt action back is for nostalgia which I wouldn‚Äôt doubt, but beyond that there‚Äôs no reason for it to replace the suppressed sniper.",FortNiteBR

We once made this game great, our suggestions, our concepts and our feedback shaped this game. We had control, we had a voice, we had power.

We are sick and tired of the terrible decisions Epic Games makes, we are tired of seeing this beautifull game suffer from things no-one wished for. 

We all know what operation health means. Honestly Epic, few people care about the actual next season.. the whole season story line is wasted anyways. It‚Äôs all way out of line and many of us find our self saying; This isn‚Äôt fortnite at every new season trailer. 

We want to go back to the roots. Back to Risky Reels, Tomato Town, Anarchy, Greasy etc. Flush the whole season thing. CANCEL IT. Gives us back the old weapon pool and flush everything new, even if there are some good ones in there. 

Start from the roots slowly add in stuff and see how we react, not how the new players react or the players with 0.3 kd. How WE, US, THE COMMUNITY reacts. 

We need a whole season of testing and feedback, resetting and communication.

The game is suffering from a cancerious virus that you EPIC created. Time to heal.

I want all the Fortnite lovers to comment down below how they feel about this. Only if we raise our voice we can achieve the levels of fun we once had playing Fortnite",FortNiteBR

Replacing a wall is impossible if the opponent holds the build button. Literally. If we had no turbo building then replacing a wall would come down to speed and timing.

2: The game would have less overbuilding thus less lag.

3: effortless mass building would be a thing of the past. If I get shot, you will see me doing 90s while mass building everywhere and there is literally nothing my opponent can do to catch me, especially if I have more mats than him.

4: overall I miss the times where building wasn‚Äôt so effortless and I believe that the game was way better for that reason. Not only for casual play but also when playing competitively.

Getting outbuilt should not be a matter of who is willing to spend most materials on a fight, but instead who is the smartest and most efficient builder.",FortNiteBR

I am not a casual, I play competitive. I am open to any of your opinions wether they are with or against me.

Combat Shotgun

Stats are perfect except for spawn rate. Pumps were almost as good as combats, but way more common. I think the spawn rate should be upped so that there is more than 1 person with a combat in one POI.

Tactical Shotgun

Very bad state right now, always has been since season 4-5. Huge bullet spread, inconsistent, overall bad.

AR/scar

Has always been perfect

Pistol/ silenced pistol

Compared to smgs, they do ruffly the same amount of damage but they are semi auto, and have a wider spread. If the spread was more tight, I could see this coming in handy.

RPG

Reload time should be 4 seconds like the heavy sniper, but I am used to rpgs now, and i can easily react to one coming towards me because its really slow.

Grenade launcher

Its like finding grenades, but finding 6 of them. Make the fire rate slower

Proximity launcher

Broken in medium and close range. You can hit people on highground even though you cant see them. You can hit people around any corners, its like an rpg but faster and less damage.

Tac AR

Doesnt flood chests, small bloom, rewards accuracy, and can be used both close and long range. Nice, but id almost always choose a scar over it, unless im running low on medium bullets.

Stinks

The damage tick is too fast, should do 5 tick every 1 second, like the storm.

Storm flip

Why dont they overlap anymore? The thing does 5 damage immediately once you get into it, unlike the normal storm that waits 1 second to do damage. Even with the nerf, people will still hold this thing to endgame to get the most out of it. Fine in pubs, broken in scrims, for a quick 1-3 points.

AK

uncommon ak should not exist. Its way to common, and since AK is rarely chosen over normal ARs, I feel like 2 rarities of the gun is fine. Bloom gets huge once you shoot more than 4 bullets at once, better for slow and accurate shots, which dont fit with the spray meta.

Drum gun

Was insane when it came out, but im seeing it being used less in scrims and pubs more, combat or even tac shotgun can kill someone spamming this gun.

Burst smg

I like it, meant for people with really good tracking, and quick hitmarkers to finish off someone, but I dont feel the need for an smg in my loadout as combat has a good firerate already, equivalent to a double pump.

Deagle

Was broken before, after the nerf it is still good because of the damage, but yet again, not something to go with in the spam meta, would always choose a scar over it unless im going for clips.

Heavy sniper

I love using it, but the people that i hit have probably broken one of their keys. 150 for a body shot is too rewarding, and leaves the player incapable of doing much other than clutching up. Reduce to 147?

Silenced sniper

Better than bolt. Only 5 damage less for something you cant hear. Nice

Bow

Its like a silenced sniper but without a scope, and does splash damage. Now that I think of it, atleast the heavy sniper requires aim. A good nerf would be to have it without the blue indicator,  but make it have a grenade launcher reticle or a sniper reticle.

Scoped AR

Also rewards players with good aim, but I‚Äôd always choose an AR over it since an ar can be used close-mid range better.

Semi auto

Does anyone like this gun? It does a lousy 75 damage, bullet drop off is so wierd, and i only find it annoying when its used to break builds. Not OP, but takes up chests where I could have gotten a better weapon.

Bandages

Can we use them up to 100? A body shot with a combat still 1 shots you at 75HP, and leaves you super vulnerable, and youll be stuck with 30 hp when a random ar shot hits you.

Shields

Just make them more common 

Traps

Don‚Äôt require any skill to do 150 damage with it, except for trapping your opponent in a box and placing the trap. Nothing much. Make it do 100 damage

Turrets

Annoying, but not OP. They are kinda useless, especially in solos. Make them harder to find",FortNiteBR

I was fine, I knew I was outplayed. The other player was simply just better with the same weapons and I needed to get better. Nowadays it‚Äôs just because you have 5 tacs and somehow he found a combat and two proximity nade launchers. 

One of my friends is a season 1 player and has loved this game since its conception. He loved every single season, some more than others, but he was one of the games biggest supporters no matter what decision epic made. He quit at the beginning of season 9 due to some decisions made by epic. He got online once in a while to see if epic changed anything. 

He came back once to check out how the storm flip was and left our party after one squads game. Haven‚Äôt seen him online for a week. Moved onto 2K since. I don‚Äôt want to be one of those whiny sweats complaining about this game not being the ‚ÄúOG DAYS‚Äù. But we can‚Äôt ignore that there are problems with this game. 


Another friend, who‚Äôs a complete casual, plays like once a week only to talk to friends and chill. First BP was S8, all that posterboy casual stuff. He used to play every day and laughed when he died and just loved talking to friends and playing the game. We loved his excitement when he got a single kill. Now he doesn‚Äôt play at all. Same reason, the game just isn‚Äôt the same.  


There is no skill or practice involved in the battle of spamming a combat. Sensitivity and how fast you press the trigger determines your fate. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the drum gun, boom bow, and the proximity launcher. There‚Äôs no way to combat  them. In the season before, mid-game was a risky time. However you could really only a one hit third party if you had a sniper and there was a low chance of getting a rocket launcher mid game. 

You had to sneak up and shotgun them if you wanted to one hit them. Now? 20 damage from 50 meters away, or a boom bow, or a proximity launcher. So many ways.


Oh, and I‚Äôm sick of a grey tac, 2 grey heavy ARs, a burst smg, and shadow bombs as my starting loadout.  The loot pool is horrible. Past games have improved over time. This game is the opposite. 


TL;DR: unpopular opinion, this game is only getting worse with the shitty loot pool and spam/rng based chance of a kill/winning.",FortNiteBR

Spectral Axe

Description: I noticed that Spectral Axe is facing the wrong direction. Compared to the direction the other three axes in the leftmost picture are facing right, (Spectral in bottom right) while the Spectral is facing left. This issue also appears in game, with the unintended end of the pickaxe facing forward.

(Also, I think that it is not intended, because other similarly designed axes are facing right. This also occurs in pickaxes such as Lucky and Crimson Axe.)

Since the new proximity launcher is so easy and FUN to use I think that everyone should spawn with one in their inventory, this would mean that when you drop at a busy location players will be eliminated randomly which will mean that there are less players in the area and gives lower skilled players a better chance of surviving the drop. 

Skilled and unskilled players will be eliminated imdiscriminately and will lower the chances of a 15 kill sweat wining the game :)

There is a game on the horizon that will put a serious dent into Fortnites popularity.  I'm calling it now.  The game is called Scavengers.  It's free to play and it's coming out next year.

As an example me and 2 of my other friends went to Pleasant Park which was a hot drop, we killed about 9 people or so and shot down every hot drop and the best we got were blue tacs. We then come up against another player who ends up killing us all, now credit to him he clearly outplayed us but we could not put up a fight cos the tac does nothing and he had a combat which took off all our health like it was nothing.

So what do I want?
Well the pump is not coming back or at least not this season, we know the heavy shotgun is, fortnite have two choices: either increase the chances of a combat dropping or bring the heavy pump WITH a slight buff, that way we can actually compete.

I had seen some of my favorite YouTubers playing it and it looked really fun. I was glad that the Switch was getting some more online games, especially one that was free since I was broke at the time.

I enjoyed what amount of S4 I got to play and all of S5. I wasn't crazy about 6 and hardly played 7, but I got back in at the end for the free battle pass. And I absolutely loved 8. 

But Epic, you ported this game to the Switch knowing full well it had hardware limitations, and yet you did nothing to try and ease things for Switch players. We can't go to big exciting locations because the polygons time travel back to the 90s, we deal with extreme lag all of the time and sometimes the game is quite literally unplayable.

I know we aren't a large part of the Fortnite community. But by porting the game to our system, you were saying that you wanted us to be part of this. Guess you didn't mean it, because the game is so buggy it makes you look worse than PUBG on Xbox. 

The Switch has a great roster of games coming, so I think I'll go find my fun elsewhere. For those of you on Switch having your doubts, you're welcome to join me. For those of you on other systems, I hope you enjoy the game we can't. I might still play around with Creative on my PC, but I'm done playing on Switch, and I'm not buying another Battle Pass.

We dwarf you in size, power, and importance.","I'm not sure why this needs to be said but Fortnite is one of the most successful games of all time because 250+ million have played it.

To expect a game of this magnitude to cater to anyone but the masses is laughable.  This isn't Street Fighter V.

The casual player makes up the vast majority of the player base and thus the revenue stream.  Furthermore, the competitive community is not only insignificant in size and influence, but it also makes up a sticky player base, unlike the casual community.  

Casual players come and go based on what they find fun.  Competitive players ""marry"" a game because they've sunk so much time into it already.  Competitive players will stay in the ecosystem because they're intrinsically committed to the game.  Casual players are not.

TLDR: Stop thinking the competitive community has any kind of long term voice in a game like Fortnite.  It doesn't.",FortNiteBR

Then in Season 9 I would get killed by a sweaty player I would have those thoughts from season 8 but saying things like, ""You suck at building"" "" or ""I suck because I can't build right"".

I really don't understand that because all of us want CS:GO and other games to become a great eSports discipline.

1. to lower the entry threshold in the game for newbies;
2. make it possible for non-pro or semi-pro players to monetize their skill and earn money during their road to pro-scene etc.

Honestly this mode isnt hard to beat on your own if you do it properly, i just did my first match and beat it in the first try. So i figured i may as well come on here and put out some tips for those who may be curious, i will try to make it as simple and quick as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Loadout and their uses.\*\*

Forget the standard loadout you use in BR, in this, the only things you will need are a drum gun, and a regular ar (or a scar if you are lucky enough to get one) clingers, or an rpg if you end up getting one, Shadow bombs and slurps.

 The AR is for when they are coming at a slower to decent pace, where you can easily pick them off with a single headshot, And the drumgun is for when you really are getting swarmed, just aim about head level and start left clicking, they will go down quickly enough.

&amp;#x200B;

The splodes you have can be really good for getting rid of a lot if you can train them around for a bit and get them gathered up in a nice lump. The Shadow bomb is easily the best thing in the loadout, simply because when you go invisible, all of the fiends stop because you are by yourself, so it can easily be a get out of jail free card, and can be used to put you in better placement. The slurp is good simply because it is healing that you can use quickly, and get while moving, which is important.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*General Tips\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

Do not stop moving... If you stop moving, you will quickly get swarmed, and while the items i said above can be really useful, some of them are not all that common, so it is better to keep moving to avoid getting yourself stuck. Don't even bother with building, it is better to have an open area to run around in then constricting your playfield, The only time you should be building is if you need to get over terrain. Always go for the ice fiends, yellow fiends, and big purple guys as soon as you see them, they will really mess things up for you if you dont, even if it means taking a few hits from the normal zombies. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Fighting the final boss\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, this can really come down to the environment you are in, but my best tip is to save at least a single shadow bomb for when he appears, and as soon as he appears, start laying into him, when he starts getting close, use a shadow bomb to run and try and get high ground on him so you can start pelting him in the head once more. I didnt even let him get close enough to hit me so i do not know how hard he hits, but if he is stronger then the elite brutes, you will be in trouble if he gets close. If you are just going for the finish, ignore the zombies that you can, and only kill when you are forced too, if you are going for points, you just gotta keep him away from you so you can do what you need to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Look: Pump, silenced SMG, Tack SMG, Hunting Rifle, Grenade, Normal Sniper and the only one remaining is the AR and Tack Shotgun. I think I've got all of them. And I think that I have the answer to this. Fortnite try too keep their game fresh, so by vaulting old guns, it's like if you're playing a new game.

Let me explain;,"The one thing that people don't want in this game I believe might be the saving grace;

- **Skill Based Matchmaking** 

Let me explain; last year Epic announced they woulf add SBMM, everyone moaned and groaned about it and Epic changed their plans. The skill gap grew and grew and Epic needed something to even it out.  Players were getting their cheeks clapped by god tier players. This came in the Timmy items, slowly Epic transitioned the game to those items, first the spray meta then to today with the, well whatever mess it is. That was Epic's failsafe at keeping the skill gap even.

I believe that adding SBMM is the only possible way to go back to the balanced casual and competitive play days. Skill Based Matchmaking will keep the skill gap secure and Epic can stop worrying about little Timmy getting clapped, they can actually focus on balancing the game for all players.

**WE NEED TO BEG, CRY, AND SCREAM FOR SKILL BASED MATCHMAKING. I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE SAVING GRACE FOR THIS GAME.**",FortNiteBR

For a while I was considered a casual player. I didn't scrim, I played this game on my xbox one with all my irl friends and just tried to win pub games. Started to develop more skill and remained in pubs and on console and became a casual sweat I guess, trying to get as many kills as possible. Then I moved away from that, got a pc and have been a comp player since around November. I have always tried to look at the bright side of every update/patch and continue to enjoy the game. I know I probably am gonna sound like one of those nerdy complaining comp nerds, but I genuinely do not enjoy the changes/game right now, and not just for competitive. I personally feel like on the casual side of things this game isn't really enjoyable as much as it used to be either. But I can't really judge that since I haven't played that way in so long. Im not here to try and make a point or get Epic to change something, but I am trying to figure some things out on my own; like why all of my irl friends/casual friends have quit this game, most of my comp friends have quit to but I already understand why they have, but the only explanation of why my irl and casual friends have quit is because of how the game has drastically changed over the last few months. The game we all loved and would get on to play every single day and have a blast, and now I haven't seen any of them on Fortnite in weeks.

It‚Äôs a great game, but something just isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be. (PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING. THIS IS A MORE POSITIVE APPROACH TO MY LAST POST)","As most of you know, and I hate to admit this, our beloved game is (not dying) going in a wrong direction because epic are doing silly things that the majority of the community dislike. The game just isn‚Äôt the same. For example, the addition of the proximity launcher, storm flip (which now is basically a stink bomb), combat shotgun and burst smg and  the vaulting of the pump shotgun, the hunting rifle and the suppressed and compact smgs, just so bad players can use them to their advantage. Now, I am not necessarily saying all these changes made are negative, but take the pump for example - of course people are going to quit and be angry: it was such a stupid decision that was very unnecessary. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have been enjoying the new season, but with the removal of og tilted and retail row, the game just isn‚Äôt the same - another reason for the community to be upset. These changes are silly IN MY OPINION (MAYBE NOT YOURS) and (as I have been playing since season 2) I truly believe that the game was at its best point around season 3-4. There were no slipstreams or sky platforms, no overpowered weapons (apart from the drum gun), no major map changes. It was the Fortnite I liked best. The game was fun to play and everyone was at a pretty equal skill level, so the game was fair. Games ran pretty smoothly and the storyline was great. The battle passes were the best we have ever seen and there were no sweats. Now days the game is pretty bland, like pizza with no toppings - something is just missing. Most of my friends have quit. The lobbies are mixed with different platforms, which is stupid, and full of sweats. Battle passes are pretty average and tier 100s are terrible. This is JUST MY OPINION, but I am sure that at least a few will agree too. Now, how is it that we as a community can work together and let epic know we want a change? here is my idea: The season 9 storyline comes to an end with something to do with cube magic and the map that has been overtaken by the monster. The characters use this magic to go back in time to around season 3 era and season ten introduces the og map, with a traditional style battle pass. Epic games gets the community (through in game poll system) to vote for weapons they want in/out of the game, making it a fair way for vaulted items to make their return and unwanted ones to be put back in the vault. All  pro players are permanently put in lobbies with players with the same skill level, so that casual player (like me) can play in a fair game.

For example, the addition of the proximity launcher, storm flip (which now is basically a stink bomb), combat shotgun and burst smg and  the vaulting of the pump shotgun, the hunting rifle and the suppressed and compact smgs, just so bad players can use them to their advantage. Now, I am not necessarily saying all these changes made are negative, but take the pump for example - of course people are going to quit and be angry: it was such a stupid decision that was very unnecessary. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have been enjoying the new season, but with the removal of og tilted and retail row, the game just isn‚Äôt the same - another reason for the community to be upset. With the addition of the sky platforms and slipstreams, it is a perfect opportunity for bad players to camp and get an unworthy victory, when other players are trying their best, playing the game properly. These changes are silly in my opinion and (as I have been playing since season 2) I truly believe that the game was at its best point around season 3-4. There were no slipstreams or sky platforms, no overpowered weapons (apart from the drum gun), no major map changes. It was the Fortnite I liked best. The game was fun to play and everyone was at a pretty equal skill level, so the game was fair. Games ran pretty smoothly and the storyline was great. The battle passes were the best we have ever seen and there were no sweats. Now days the game is pretty boring and most of my friends have quit. The lobbies are mixed with different platforms, which is stupid, and full of sweats and campers. batte, passes are pretty average and tier 100s are terrible. This is just my opinion, but I am sure others will agree too. Now, how is it that we as a community can work together and let epic know we want a change? here is my idea: The season 9 storyline comes to an end with something to do with cube magic and the map that has been overtaken by the monster. The characters use this magic to go back in time to around season 3 era and season ten introduces the og map, with a traditional style battle pass. Epic games gets the community to vote for weapons they want in/out of the game, making it a fair way for vaulted items to make their return and unwanted ones to be put back in the vault.All  pro players are permanently put in pro lobbies, so that casual player (like me) can play in a fair game  this solution would bring back some  balance to the game we love so much, encouraging old players to return.

When season 4 starts, one of the meteors has hit tilted towers, and one dusty depots and somewhere else as well. And we got these meteor ""Hop rock"" things everywhere!

The coverment starts to find these hop rocks and research them. Then we find this meteor that cracks and has the visitor in it.


Visitor goes to omega's base and launches a rocket. The rocket flies everywhere and ends up into a portal. The portal is called rift and now season 5 begins.


Season 5 begins and moisty mire and anarchy acres gets replaced with new places. Now when the season starts there is the super big rift in the sky. Some things start disappearing from some places like lonely lodge welcome sign and greasy grove burger thing.

Like nothing happens in weeks 1-5. Then the rift turned purple and started lightning. Those lightnings lasted like 3days and then it spitted out a purple cube ""Kevin"" Kevin rolls around the map for weeks, and makes runes everywhere. Then Kevin ends into loot lake and drowns into there, and it was called the end of the season ""thanos lake"" (it wasn't its real name but some people called it thanos lake so its thanos lake now :))


Season 6 starts and loot lake's island starts to float and cube is in its butt. And the rune places got these shadow cube things that we can use. Then the loot lake (that is now leaky lake) island goes to everywhere where the cube went gaining some energy from them. Later that same season we got the fortnitemares event so the island exploded. 


Nothing really happened later that season lol but season 7 started and nothing happened and storyline is shit now :(",FortNiteBR

(Long)","I know that the more the game stays the same, the less appeal there is to continue to play it. BUT, change needs to be warranted through the evolution of the player-base. Hear me out.

Loot:

The constant pandering to new players by adding low risk, high reward items, has made the game feel like your evolution as a player is not important. What I mean by this is, how many of you guys when you first were introduced to the game, would spend 15 minutes chilling in a bush to make top 10? How rewarding did it feel to get there? Now that there are so many items that pander to new players, it feels like epic is trying to take the training wheels off way too early. I feel this affects the ""experienced"" player-base because, as players who throughout the first four season, had to forge our skill and break out of our shell by using the weapons and items that are balanced and intended for a Battle Royale, we are being cheated by having the proper and correct loot pool be watered down by items that are there to diminish your skills.

Fun:

I remember the days when I would log onto fortnite and see the news page that showed a new item and I would be excited to get to try something new and see how much I liked it, and most importantly, how fun it would be. But nowadays I find that every time a new item shows up in the news feed, I roll my eyes in disappointment, because I know that this item isn't here for me to have fun, it's here so that the new players have a chance to fight against experienced players. The game was much more fun when there was more strategy involved than just fighting. There's nothing wrong with camping in a bush as a new player to get to know the game. Then when you're ready to break out of your shell, you pick up a gun and start honing your skills. 

Mobility:

The other part of gameplay that I think has kind of lost its novelty, is mobility. Mobility in this game has caused the pace of the gameplay to feel incredibly unnatural. The storm in my opinion is a non-factor in the game anymore when its sole purpose is to act as a sort of 'natural selection' process. Geysers, slip streams, hover boards, quad crashers, ballers, rift-to-go, cannons, zip-lines, launch pads, redeploys, shadow bombs, etc. It's too much. The storm used to be a threat in game and should still to feel like a threat. All it is now is a funnel that drops you into an end game spam fest, which is not fun at all, and the most important thing to me in this game is fun. Not to say that flying across the map in the wind tunnel isn't fun, it's is, but it's the wrong kind of fun in a game like this. 

Map:

The last problem I have with game-play is the map. I am not opposed to changing the map by any means, but it seams to me that 99% of the time they update the map, they destroy a piece of it instead of changing it. I'm open to regular map additions, however trying to evolve the map based on a story line has caused them to decimate many places that have no reason to be ruined. Here's a list off the top of my head:

- Dusty Depot
- Prison
- Tilted Building
- Loot Lake
- Motel
- Risky Reels
- Flush Factory
- Greasy Grove
- The whole top right side of the map
- Tilted Towers 
- Retail Row
- Other minor locations

You get my point. There's no reason  that a place such as paradise palms needs a full quarter of the map to be changed for it to have a reason to exist. There's no reason that tilted or retail needed to be destroyed for there to be a futuristic version of them. Just add it to the map. The saying ""don't fix something that isn't broken comes to mind"".

In summation, the problem I have with rapid change, is that with every weekly update, the game is straying further and further from the things that make it unique and fun. Hiding, shooting, building. This was the foundation that the game was build on and all of these foofie novelty changes are just making that foundation weaker and weaker because they violate the principles of said foundation, ie; can't build in slip streams, can't box up and hide because of stink bombs, can't have a proper gun fight with someone without being spammed with explosives, smgs, throwables, etc. I hope you guys can see my point of view.",FortNiteBR

The worst part is that that's headshot damage, not body. They do as much damage As an Epic Heavy Sniper does to the body. They need one of two things, a rarity adjustment, or a damage Nerf. I think for the damage they do currently they should be epic rarity, or better yet, Nerf the damage.

A question just came across my mind: Is the pump the best or is it the heavy? I've come to reddit to see everyone's opinions.

I think that the heavy is better. It has a faster fire rate and better capacity. Sure, the damage is less, but its only 96. Plus, the better fire rate makes this even better.

I wan't to know your guy's opinions. Please share!

I have never made negative posts about this game and I rarely make negative comments either, but with the addition of proximity launcher I just don't even have the urge to play the game anymore, this is the first time I'm saying that in months. It was the final nail in the coffin for me. 

Season 5's meta was trash, but Season 9 is season 5's meta but 5x worse. Not only do we have the Drum Gun back, we now have spammy shotguns that take little to no skill, **excessive** mobility, the Pump's gone, the SMG got replaced with something way worse, and too many noob-friendly things are in the game now. One thing Season 5 had going for it was the map update, it was a really good map and the desert biome's still nice. Now we have Tilted being a shell of it's former self because it's just so poorly designed, Retail Row/Mega Mall have also lost it's appeal, **the goddamn snow/ice biome is still there**, and the map is just so cluttered. 

I don't understand why Epic is so hell-bent on changing the game into something it's not. It's a Battle Royale, survival of the fittest, the better player should win consistently. Please stop making the game so noob-friendly, it's ruining it for the people who actually play your game daily and want to be good at it, the people who consistently buy cosmetics and battle passes, these are the people that should be kept happy because they're the core of the game, not the extreme casuals who play once a month, or the ""little timmys,"" as people call it. I looked up Paragon and how Epic games killed it (unpopular changes, trying to make the game into something it's not) and it sounds exactly like what's happening to Fortnite right now.

Epic is not a bad company by any means, but whoever is in charge of season 9 needs to go. This season absolutely blows.",FortNiteBR

(on console at least),"I understand the nature of the game is survival. I took a break a while ago because some new games came out and now that I've started playing again, this doesn't feel like the high action game I was used to.  
Running around farming materials without an enemy in sight for an entire match because everybody's hiding away somewhere and won't fight, isn't fun. Killing everybody in the final circles yourself just to lose to a guy with one gun who has been hiding in a baller the entire match and popped out at the last person to secure the win, isn't even a satisfying loss.  
Team Rumble is the only thing I'm enjoying because there is no camp meta. You get out there, you fight. That's what I play shooters and battle royales for. Team Rumble is the most fun I've had in a non-story driven game for a long time, but I miss Solos and Squads.

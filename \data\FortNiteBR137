It can’t compete with any other gun of of spawn aside from another pistol MAYBE but it really wouldn’t make a difference if it’s vaulted due to having the supressed pistol and six shooter in the game also. SMGS: I feel like the only reason you guys took out the tactical smg is because it was with the drum gun and it those were really strong in the game. But now I feel as though smgs are weaker/balanced now  but I feel like the addition of the tac smg +supressed smg OR either one would make the necessary Change for smgs,because the their isn’t much difference between the two smg’s besides mag size and rarity. With that it’s just basically one Smg archetype in a way imo. Not sure how well this will meld with other but I’m curious to see what others think. ",FortNiteBR

Basically I play fortnite on a mac using geforce now with a ps4 controller plugged in. It always worked perfectly well until 3 days ago where I had some problems. When i move the analog stick in any quick motion, It always makes me move more or in some weird way for example when I do 90 degree turns, once i let go of the analog stick it makes me keep moving and complete like a full one by one, or when i try to edit it moves extra, or even shooting my crosshair moves down and up and its random, but if im moving straight and not doing anything its all good. When I tried using my controller on the ps4 there were no problems which is why I odnt know why this is happening. Please help

Things I have tried:

\- different wire to connect controller,

\- different controller(had same problem)",FortNiteBR

Epic has some of the fastest devs in game development nowadays, and they should be acknowledged for that. They usually hop on bugs really quick with some exceptions. For the stuff people complain about, other games take even *longer* to fix. They have exceptional servers for the amount of people that play this game. Every game dev makes mistakes. I don't understand why Epic is judged the harshest...

I don’t get to see my son often as I am in the middle of a custody battle with my ex.  Ever since I got remarried, there has been excuse after excuse for me not to see him (and his sisters).  I am in the middle of court proceedings to get things changed.

Both players that bought the skin last year and players that buy it this year should be given a couple of challenges.

Players who buy the skin this year will have the new style upon completion of the challenges.

OG's who bought the skin last year will have **immediate** access to the style. Upon completion of the challenges they should instead be awarded XP, Battle Pass Stars and/or V-Bucks.

The challenges could be any or all the following ideas:

* Get X kills, while wearing \[Skin\]
* Get X kills in one match, while wearing \[Skin\]
* Win a match, while wearing \[Skin\]
* Complete 7 Daily Challenges

The reason for ""Complete 7 Daily Challenges"" being there is that it would essentially lock new buyers out for a week, making it an early exclusive for OG's.

With this suggestion, it gives **all** players that buy the skin additional challenges to work towards which ultimately gets people playing more, without penalizing people for not playing the game or buying the skin at a certain time, all while giving OG's an extra reward for buying the skin at an earlier date.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

![video](yf9r6y91qb521 ""These are the players you get when you pretend to play poorly for over 33 games"")

The video above is a result of pretending to play bad for 33 games on a second account and observing the skill level of the players in my lobbies as well as playing a few games and recording my kill averages and there was a drastic difference in skill compared to my main account as well as a drastically higher kill average in the games I played seriously compared to the over 200 games I have played this season on my main account  
Epic games can easily and quickly disable this feature that i have just exploited. It is there game. We've seen them do it with the infinity blade 3 days after it's release.  
The Experiment: Pretend to play bad on my second account  
Hypothesis:If i pretend to play bad i should be put in lobbies with lesser skilled players because our theoretical skill based matchmaking system would tailor to newbs like the player I was pretending to be.

Experiment Instructions: Pretend to play bad on second account. I cannot build. I cannot kill another opponent and must be killed by another opponent so no suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

Observations: After the 11th game I noticed a slight drop in the skill level of the players. Every 11th game the players would continue to get worse. So after 33 games you get the players that I have shown in the video above. 

Facing players that would run away from me instead of push me even when they have the advantage. Players mostly not building. Enemies lacking knowledge of even the most basic building strategies and techniques

&amp;#x200B;

Results: I recorded the number of kills I would get from the games I didn't pretend to play bad and actually put effort into. I have included the links to the videos of the games I played below

&amp;#x200B;

|Trial|Game 1|Game 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|7|0|
|2|3|6|
|3|9|0|
|4|1|2|
|5|6|1|

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the big takeaway

Kill average on Smurf on the first game of each trial after pretending to play poorly:4  
Kill average on smurf in the 10 games i actually tried : 3  
Kill average on main account in 6000 games: 1  
Kill average on main for season 6: 1.5  
Kill average on main for season 7:1.0

&amp;#x200B;

My stats aren't even improving they are drastically decreasing despite epic games bragging about the almost 20 million new players joining the game in the last year. From 20 million players last November to 120 million reported this month and I have been playing Fortnite since January

This statistic of my average kills on the smurf is significant because 98% of Fortnite players have less than a 4 kill average and another 93% have less than a 3 kill average according to TRN and yet I was able to dominate in these games and I was rarely getting out built and I was outplaying a majority of my opponents.

If I had a kill average of a 4 like I have in the trials then I wouldn’t be making this post. My main account is almost unplayable with me playing 7 games in row and only managing 1 kill from the 7. This post is a cry for help. My main account is unplayable

Highest kill game on smurf was 9 in the 10 games(that I actually put effort into) while highest kill on my main was 7 kills in my 200 games of season 7.  


&amp;#x200B;

Only Including stats from first two games because matchmaking from What I have observed resets very quickly and only takes 1-2 games to match you up with players of your appropriate skill level

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Important Notes from these games:

Trial one: Players lacking awareness decision making and not building 

Trial Two: Only trial that I played solos as a reflection of how much I played solos on my main account. I play 5 times as many squad games than any other mode on my main account so one solo trial felt adequate. Also one of two trials in which I played 11 games poorly instead of the full 33 so players in these trials players were still bad but not as bad as the other trials

Trial Three: The most important trial. I was playing squads with my friends for about three hours couldn't get more than four kills and neither could any of my friends. I switch to second account which I already prepped from the previous night and dropped 9 kills on the very first game of switching accounts. Most kills of the entire day and and for me personally the entire season. my kill record on both accounts for season 7 despite already having played over 200 games on my main account at that point and not having more than 7 kills

Trial 4: I feel as though I messed up with this trial because I didn’t do 33 instead I only did 11 and went into squads

Trial 5: This trial is  almost as important as trial 3 because it featured players not building running away from fights as well as it being the first game of the night on my second account with me having my highest kill game overall for the entire night. Before I played the game I was again playing on my primary for three hours and went 6 games with only managing 1 kill at 1 point. Highest kill of the night before I switched accounts was a 4.Could've had 9 or 10 kills but teammate was taking my kills. Altogether though we combined for 11

&amp;#x200B;

So many kills in these videos of players not building

Low kill games deaths due to rng that comes with early game why I didn't record them

Sitting in front of your TV and game console and pretending to play bad is very time consuming. Especially when you do it over 30 times and redo it every time you decide to sweat. But it's for science :)

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: There was an obvious disparity in skill between the players on my primary Fortnite account and and my secondary and there is an obvious general inconsistency with the average skill level of players especially across different accounts.

Theory:Skill based matchmaking was shadow enabled at the start of season 3 shortly after the idea was floating around the community about whether Fortnite needed it or not. SBMM got a lot of backlash mainly from already established players and skill players at the time. Also for epic games to successfully shadow enable SBMM without doubts being casted they allowed for players with already high kill averages to keep and maintain their high kill averages(newb lobbies). While players like myself who didn't start getting good after season 3 would have SBMM enabled on their accounts  


Again my kill average is unchanged over the course of year despite me putting in what I would call and unhealthy amount of hours into the game as the year went on(because I love Fortnite)

Also with my observations it seemed as though the matchmaking operated with a tier system as I conducted the experiment. Offers the best explanation for why my solos KD dropped even though my skill was improving. I guess I was too good for the theoretical tier that I was in during season 5 when my kill averaged peaked. Would also explain the players getting worse after the 11th game and me maybe being ""demoted"".  


This experiment is my only concrete evidence supporting the existence of SBMM and it being scientific means the experiment can be repeated. If you don’t believe fortnite has SBMM which I believe it 100% does i encourage you to replicate this experiment on a spare account (before epic sees this post and swiftly disables this feature I have uncovered and exposed)

It doesn’t make sense for a player like myself with 400 wins in 6000 games and a highest kill game record of 15 in a single match to also be going 7 straight games with zero kills and for this to be happening on a daily basis. Very unpleasant gaming experience. Even more unpleasant for my friends who try and play with me. I have a group of friends who don’t even want to play with me for these very reasons. They say things like ""it's not fun playing with me"" even though I know and they know I am in fact a better player than them. Not to sound cocky by the way.  
I might be in the top 20 or 10% of the skill gap but i'd never know because i'm constantly getting dunked on by other players who may also be in the top 10% with me  
I performed this experiment at 3 and 11 in the morning as well as at 8 at night so time of day has no effect on skill level of players. The Video above was actually taken at 4 in the morning when the sweats are apparently supposed to show themselves.  
Other evidences i have supporting skill based matchmaking that i have observed over the last 9 months  
1. Solos KD dropping drastically in August from 1.79 to .86(Top 15% to bottom 40% according to TRN) on my main account despite me still putting in a consistent amount of playtime. Solos for me becoming a Third Party Sweat fest

2.My friend whos been playing for three weeks and doesn't build has a kill record of 8. When we play duos he literally gives me all of his material when we engage in a fight. When we play duos he also can go 13 games without a kill despite the other day getting 8 kills and playing for only 3 weeks. Him getting into newb lobbies is the only possible explanation for him getting 8 kills.

3.Me and all of my friends KDs as well as win rates are on a downward decline despite epic games bragging every month about the new players coming in every month which should in theory make our stats go up. Stats the lowest since March despite the player population increasing by 100-200% and me doubling my playtime since March

4.Friends especially casual friends...friend groups that I chose to keep separate... literally all telling me the same thing, that for some reason it's harder to play and get kills with me than with anybody else. They get excited when I join because they know I’m a good player but they don’t have fun when we actually load into a game. That makes me feel bad so I had to put my privacy on private because I don’t want to put any of the people on my friends list through the miserable experience of playing with me. Some people on my friends list or one of my friend groups not wanting to play with me for this very reason. Friends that can get 8 or 9 kill on a particular day but then come to play with me and can go hours of playing with me and not getting more than 3 or 4 kills.

5.Playing hours on end with my casual friends and we get very little kills and die in the first 5 minutes of most of our games. As soon as I leave they are sending me a message and a screenshot of them winning their very first game after I got off with a hefty 16 kills just the three of them NO FILL.

6.I also had suspicions of how matchmaking behaved when you select Don’t fill in the pre game lobby with a three man squad. The lobbies where noticeably easier. So going off of this knowledge I played duos with another friend of mine the following week. We were struggling and couldn’t manage to last more than 5 minutes in any duos game and we played that night for more than an hour. So I suggested we play Squads don’t fill just the two of us. He was hesitant and confused but to his surprise and not to mine we won our very first game of the night on DUOS SQUADS with a combined 17 kills

7. Youtubers who don’t know each other making videos on the existence of skill based matchmaking as well as notable streamers such as SypherPK questioning its already implementation

8.Having friends tell me that they haven’t broken their kill record since the first month they started playing Fortnite and they have been putting in reasonable game time for almost a year since they started playing.

9. Having a friend who refuses to play on his own account and plays on his older brothers because he averages twice as many kills on his older brother’s account than he does on his own

10. Players posting videos on Youtube of dropping 30+ kills with almost half of the 30 kills being players who don’t build. These players posting high kill game plays were already averaging a lot of kills prior to the start of season 3. These videos are as recent as a week ago as well. Meanwhile when I play Fortnite I am getting destroyed by players multi layer ramp rushing me with double 90 degree turns. 

11.Before August we'd have win streaks of up to 6 games in a row before a certain update that month made winstreaks stop. If me and my friends win a game with 30 kills the next match it suspiciously gets so much harder to the point that even if we do manage winning the following game which is rarely now a days we barely get a third of the kills from the last game

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I’m going up against players who substitute a Bolt Action for an assault rifle and have a pump+deagle preference in close range combat when I see they’re inventory after slaughtering me. I’m getting twice in one night quickscoped in build battles. :(

People don't seem to understand skill gaps and a skill gap for a game especially one like Fortnite with so many new players coming in consistently is supposed to be bottom heavy when looking at a graph like [this](https://i.imgur.com/WtWop18.jpg). Saying “eVeRyOnE jUsT gOt GuD” and going off of observations in your public matches on only one account is a poor take if I’m being very honest  
I was once the newb that would get no kills and always die first when playing with my friends who were a lot better than me but when i played with people who were just as bad as me at that point in time i would end up getting a lot of kills than what I was used to and and so would they. You could classify us as casuals at the time This was back in March. That was when I had my first suspicions that there was a secret matchmaking algorithm at work but i paid it no mind because at the time it benefited players like me. But I had no idea it would have negative effects on players aspiring to improve.  


I can wipe out an entire squad of players who were of the same skill level as me from 9 months ago but my kill average is still the same.

&amp;#x200B;

If my stats are now bottom 30% in the world according to TRN it then means 50% of Fortnite players are able to do double 90 degree turns and have taught themselves how to aim for head shots with every shotgun shot and know how to trap kill in every build battle because that is 50-70% of the people I face in solos

&amp;#x200B;

Epic games SBMM plays on the assumption that everyone wants to play for wins when some players play and grind to see improvement and growth and very high level players play to have high kill games as a showcase for their skill.  
Solutions: If epic games decides to be transparent about this a good solution would be making the matchmaking algorithm not be so hard on very good players. A better solution would be to just separate and create a ranked and unranked playlist like other games have successfully implemented. You could get rewards for grinding the ranked playlist that wouldn't have to be V-Bucks it could be something or anything else. Bring back season 2 matchmaking as an option PLEASE.

If Fortnite adds a ranked and unranked playlist I would play both modes religiously because I will admit SBMM has given me a drive and a hunger to improve where I don’t think I would be at the skill level I am today without it.",FortNiteBR

Current SMG's: the old one does not deserve the hype (an in depth analysis),"The entire Fortnite community seems to have gone wild with the re-introduction of the Tactical Sub-machine gun. However,  in my opinion it is actually outclassed by the current weapons.

In paper, it is a better gun, having a higher rate of fire than the current weapons, however, these compensate by having a larger magazine size and dealing higher damage. Hence, these destroy builds quicker. The current weapons also have a manageable high bloom, making it easier to hit shots. The bloom of the old SMG is more similar to that of an Assault rifle, which outclasses it, so it is better to only use an AR instead of switching to an SMG when it comes to the Tactical SMG. 

To sum this up, the Tac SMG is like an assault rifle's and an SMG's worst aspects hyped up by OG players. The current weapons are better.",FortNiteBR

Suggested Shotgun Statistics:

|Name|Rarity|Damage|Headshot Multiplier|Headshot Damage|Fire Rate|Magazine Size|Reload Time|Structure Damage|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|^(Pump Shotgun)|^(Uncommon)|^(76)|^(x2.5)|^(190)|^(0.7)|^(5)|^(4.6)|^(48)|

|^(Tactical Shotgun)|^(Rare)|^(74)|^(x2)|^(148)|^(1.5)|^(8)|^(5.7)|^(58)|

With my changes, the headshot damage remains the same in all the Shotguns except the Tactical, which goes from 134 to 135 headshot damage. What changes is the damage per body shot, headshot multiplier, structure damage and reload time.  
I feel like this will encourage people to go for the headshot even more, and keep shotguns balanced with the faster reload time.",FortNiteBR

I've just watched bak the replay of my last game, and noticed that the guy who got the VR by RPG'ing me while falling from the sky spent the entire game in a plane. The ENTIRE game! He went straight to Frosty Flights, found an RPG on the floor and took a plane. He only left the plane when it was me and him left.  
He won the game by killing me - his only kill. I had 9 kills FFS.  
I don't begrudge anyone a victory when it's earned, but this was cheap and unsporting.

I'd like to offer a suggestion to Epic - how about a 'fuel gauge' on vehicles? Something to slightly limit the time you can just fly over the ocean without actually playing the game? Obviously you could just find another plane, but that'd be a risk.

I dunno, maybe I'm just ragey because I finished 2nd, but him winning like that just felt dirty.",FortNiteBR

Why does it need to come back? Its because people are being forced to break TOS for items, and OG's are limiting epic from actually making money and forcing them to make workarounds, like look at the spider knight for example, this is the closest we can really get to claiming the black knight skin, without breaking TOS, yall are actually forcing epic to push out new content, because your selfish tendencies pull out the worst in you, if something comes back, before you say ""they promised exclusivity!!!"" Id like you to remember the fact that they brung back the rogue agent, and sold it for 3 times the original price, and legit nobody cared, with a couple exceptions, now time to talk about exclusivity and the battlepass system as a whole.  


Battlepasses and exclusivity, earn exclusive items and after the time is up nobody else can earn them, cool, but the exclusive part, all it does is make people toxic, and have a god complex, it makes those feel superior to others, and it just brings out the worst in people, and also due to the exclusivity, people WILL want these items, and WILL break TOS, just to earn them, now for suggestions to potentially balance it out, I will leave a pastebin link containing all my thoughts on what could be done to balance it out, to make it fair for people who originally bought it.

I think players like the classic, ""OG"" Fortnite because everyone was way less skilled and it was more of a level playing field (not to mention how fun the game was when you first started learning and discovering). If you look back at old footage, you see no one is building or making incredible plays and gun skill was subpar.

The first paragraph is the original, the second is the embellished one. 

I was trying to get to level 80 before the season was over so I could get Omega with lights on him. I was doing the fatal fields kills challenge so I could accomplish it. I sniped two guys there and managed to snipe another on the outskirts. As I made my way north towards the circle I ran into 4 more players, who lowered my health a ton. I barely escaped those fights with my life while I kept going north. I sniped another guy and got into a super intense fight with another, coming out on top. As the game comes to a close I make a play on one of the last three guys alive. I take him out, and rush towards another one of the players and beat him, and as the last guy appears out from behind the dumpster of a restaurant and I immediately open fire on him, and within seconds the “Victory Royale” screen appears, as my kill count reads: 12.

July 7th I was staying up way past my bedtime because I wanted to get lights on the Omega skin. I was just grinding all of the Battle Pass challenges so I could get the XP. So all have left is a few challenges so I dropped fatal fields because I needed three kills there. The first chest I opened was a Blue Bolt, and I took out a guy on the roof of Fatal House and then I had to cheekiest snipe on a guy through the window of the barn. But I still need one more kill for the challenge. I saw a Teknique and snuck one between two trees easy 105 body-shot and not sure how but it counted as a Fatal Fields kill. Ok no big deal, but I want to win the game to get max XP. I keep going and run into this kid and he just comes out of nowhere but I clap him with my shotgun. A kill a few more guys on 4 HP but then finally I get a Chug Jug out of the last guy and keep going. I didn’t even notice that I got 8 kills. I find another guy hard-scoping someone 2and I hit him 262 easy. I got 9 kills so I’m like what the heck is going on, but it’s 1 AM so the bots must be roaming. I’m also scared as hell because I run into an Elite Agent and I’m like damn they probably are good, but they weren’t. They were SO. FREAKING. SWEATY. I mean ramp wall easy 180s all that good stuff. Naturally, I get clapped for 105 but I hit him too so we were both at 95 and then I get into a nice build fight with him and kill him, with only 5 people left. I call him sweaty but here I am shaking trying to get the win. I fly up to the hill on top of Tomato Tunnel and get the guy chugging after he won the fight on top of the hill. Now, these other two guys were, strangely enough, camping on top of each other in Tomato Town. I go into the top floor and clap the first kid. I guess the other guy heard me and came running out of the building and I lasered him with my SCAR. I don’t think I missed a shot. GG 12 Kill solo win!",FortNiteBR

my fiancé is working as an ergotherapist  and has a lot of young patients (5 to 15). 
Most of these children come with deficites in writing, math, concentration and other things. 

Since most kids these days play Fortnite everyone of them is so happy when my fiancé talks with them about it.
She develops tasks for them built around Fortnite and all these kids work super concentrated and passionate.

They learn how to write by writing their own Fortnite christmas stories.
They learn how to calculate by calculating players alive.
They learn what decision is smart based on certain situations.
and many more.

Crazy as it may sound, Fortnite literally saves these children and helps them overcome their deficites. ",FortNiteBR

If epic wants to change the weapon roster, then that's fine, but calling this classic is bordering to being blasfemi.

I really did enjoy that time, both the mechanics of the game and the environment it hosted for my mates and I to enjoy.

 Now I come back to the game and it's just not the same. It's over saturated with all these new guns and vehicles (wtf), teleports, stuff like that. 

Now I'm not against a game changing at all, I loved most of the changes they made during season 3 and I believe they all benefited the game and I'm sure they have made many changes from that time to now that also thoroughly benefited the game.

But this game is just not the same game that I used to enjoy. Not the same game that I wish I could play right now. I've tried to play the current version but I just can't. It's completely different.

Things like the whole building meta changing is good I think because it shows how the overall playerbase is improving but the content in it is not something I enjoy.

Maybe it's just me that feels this way about this game. Maybe people wish it was like season 1 even or season 4 or 5 or 6. Don't get me wrong, people clearly love the current direction of the game so obviously I don't want Epic to revert the game. 

However, I would like some form of retro mode, even if it's only a limited time one. Perhaps they could change the time periods regularly to keep it interesting, or even have permanent rotations of different seasons. They don't have to change any mechanics just the items and weapons available would be perfect I think.

We've seen the success of old school runescape and how it currently trumps runescape 3 by a huge margin and that was due to the game taking a turn for the worst. Obviously fortnites hasn't taken a bad turn but I still do wish for some form of retro game play.

It sucks having a system where someone can buy the entire battle pass and eventually get the same items that you bought with less effort 5 seasons later.

Everyone is able to max out the battle pass even if you only play an hour a day.  If Epic made the styles bound to the current season they would not only have many more players online, but also make more money as well.

This guy who killed me had a grey tac shotgun with 0 bullets in it and 5 bandages. He gets into a plane, drives straight to Tilted, sprays his chopper gunner, hits me 3-4 times, smashes through the build and kills me and the guy I was fighting. The addition of the health bar on the vehicles allows you to know when your plane is going to explode pretty much making the 50 damage you take when it explodes pretty useless...who is going to stay in a plane knowing its going to explode and take 50 damage? You simply just jump out before it explodes and negate the damage you wouldve taken. The increased damage you take now due to smashing through builds will not and has not made anyone ""think twice"" about driving right through the builds, again, they know when the plane will blow up...there is still 0 risk to using the planes and every possible reward. You get maximum mobility, a chopper gunner, a battering ram, a redeploy, and the odds of you taking significant damage while on the plane are 100x less than any other vehicle considering youre 100s of meter in the air from your enemies. They are simply just not a balanced addition to the game and I hate and will continue to hate planes for the remainder of my time on Fortnite, which at this point is looking like not very long. I have grown a deep hatred for about 40% of the stuff in this game. Planes, grapple hooks, turrets, balloons, lack of shields, the deagle, ziplines, the countless, never ending bugs in every single patch...but hey, im only 1 player and im not saying my opinions are fact, but theyre just my opinions.
